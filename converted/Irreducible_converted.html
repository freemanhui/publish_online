<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>This book follows my autobiography, titled Silicon: From the
invention of the microprocessor to the new science of consciousness
(Waterside, 2021), and describes the latest developments of my
continuing research on the nature of consciousness and reality.</p>
<p>Since 2010 I have deepened the study of consciousness as an
irreducible phenomenon and developed the CIP framework (acronym formed
by the initials of Consciousness, Information, and Physical). In this
conception, the nature of reality consists of two complementary and
irreducible aspects: the semantic space of conscious experiences, called
C-space, and the informational space of symbolic forms, called I-space.
Symbols are created by conscious entities to communicate and explore
their inner meaning for the purpose of knowing themselves ever more.
Physical space, called P-space, is a virtual space experienced by those
conscious entities that control living organisms. The organisms are
symbolic structures that interact with the other I-space symbols and
generate within themselves symbolic representations of I-space that are
perceived as “reality” by the conscious entities. In this framework,
consciousness exists only in C-space.</p>
<p>In March 2017, I received the following email from Professor Giacomo
Mauro D’Ariano:</p>
<p>We met briefly on Vieques Island in January 2014 at the fourth FQXi
conference on “Physics of Information”. On that occasion I gave a very
short talk of only five minutes on the derivation of Dirac’s equation
from information-theoretic principles. You gave me a very nice
compliment. Unfortunately, not knowing you, I had no way of
answering.</p>
<p>An invitation to meet followed. In April 2017 I replied via
email:</p>
<p>Dear Giacomo, sorry for the delay with which I reply to your welcomed
e-mail. My dream is to derive physics from cognitive rather than
materialistic principles. Of course, you are doing the first step, to
prove that quantum mechanics is about information, hence syntax. For me,
syntax is evidence that semantics must exist somewhere.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the existence of a hierarchy of languages (the
physical world), if no one is using them? In my opinion there is a
semantic reality that consists of a parallel hierarchy of conscious
entities that use particles, atoms, molecules, cells, animals, etc. as
symbols for their communications. The materialist only sees the symbolic
aspect, and does not realize that behind the stage there are “puppet
masters”.</p>
<p>This is why information theory is essentially isomorphic with quantum
mechanics! This is why quantum mechanics must use a probabilistic
language! The meaning of a book is free even if the symbols obey
deterministic laws (in terms of probability). This is why physics can
only guarantee that the next book to be written will obey the laws of
symbols, but cannot predict the semantic content of a book that has not
yet been written. I think semantics is the real ontology. Therefore
semantics is free, even if the syntax is deterministic.</p>
<p>These are the issues that fascinate me. And I think this is the right
way to restore meaning to a universe that has been declared “pointless”
by those who have forgotten that the meaning of existence resides
“inside” matter. Today I would say: “It exists in a deeper reality than
what manifests itself in space-time”; an interiority that is denied by a
zealous materialistic fiat.</p>
<p>I’d love to discuss these issues with you if you’re interested. I
will be in Milan around July 21, where I will be one of the presenters
at an event called Campus Party. It would be a good opportunity to
meet.</p>
<p>Thank you for expressing your gratitude for my heartfelt compliment,
and congratulations on your progress in completing Wheeler’s dream.</p>
<p>Best regards and best wishes, Federico.</p>
<p>A few days later, D’Ariano replied by telling me that he would be
very pleased to meet for us to discuss “the ontology of information,”
characterized by the phrase “software without hardware,” “which perhaps
is very close to what you call ontology of semantics, which I believe
you mean that it also involves the ‘observer,’ i.e., the
‘puppeteer.”’</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration, which a couple of
years ago allowed us to understand that the pure state of a quantum
system can represent the state of consciousness of the system, since it
has all the crucial characteristics of a conscious experience made of
qualia. This important step brought into focus the “core” of the enigma
of consciousness, which made it possible to connect the philosophical
notions of the CIP framework with the OPT (Operational Probabilistic
Theory), the theory that D’Ariano and his collaborators had developed to
demonstrate that quantum physics can be entirely derived from quantum
information postulates.</p>
<p>This new axiom allows us to claim that consciousness is a quantum
phenomenon because it has all the peculiar characteristics of a pure
quantum state, i.e., it is a definite and a private state, and so is a
pure state which is not clonable, i.e., cannot be copied and therefore
cannot be known by any observer. Therefore, such a state, if knowable at
all, is knowable only by the system that is in that state. This crucial
insight reflects remarkably the phenomenology of our inner
experience.</p>
<p>If the current idea that consciousness emerges from the functioning
of the brain were correct—where the brain is thought to be like a
classical computer—then a computer could be conscious. But then
consciousness could be copied like we routinely copy computer programs,
which is classical information. Yet we know perfectly well that our
experience is in constant evolution and is private, knowable only within
ourselves. Moreover, the meaning we feel always exceeds any symbolic
description we may produce to describe it. Therefore, even the owner of
the experience (described by quantum information) can only translate a
portion of its experience into symbols (described by classical
information).</p>
<p>Consciousness is the ability to experience through qualia and know
the meaning of the experience. Qualia are the private sensations and
feelings that reveal the meaning of the experience to the entity. The
ability to know must therefore exist before the knowing, and knowing
brings into existence what is known for the first time. Knowing
therefore becomes synonymous with existing, and this “miracle” cannot be
explained in simpler terms than these. If we accept this principle, the
fundamental entities from which everything that exists emerges must be
conscious entities similar to the monads of Leibniz.</p>
<p>This is the view that will be articulated in Irreducible, a title
that refers to the crucial property of the conscious entities endowed
with free will that emerge from One, the totality of what exists, and
cause the continuing creation and evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>One is a Whole, both in potentiality and in actuality, irreducibly
dynamic and holistic, that desires to know itself to self-realize. From
One emerge monads, or consciousness units, i.e., parts-whole that are
inseparable from One and in continuous evolution. These units
communicate with each other to know themselves, thus realizing the
intention and purpose of One they all share. Therefore, there is
becoming in the universe, and the future is not predictable, not even by
One.</p>
<p>This view is in full agreement with what quantum physics has already
revealed to us. Therefore the idea of producing a Theory of Everything
(ToE) that can predict the future of the universe is contrary to the
deepest message of quantum physics. This does not mean that the search
for a theory that reconciles quantum physics with general relativity is
not desirable; quite the contrary. The new vision, however, shows us
that the most reasonable ToE is a theory in which consciousness and free
will have always existed and in which the universe—that is, One—is open
because its evolution is the evolution of its knowing. The ToE can only
tell us the characteristics of the outer world as symbolic correlations
of the inner world of meaning.</p>
<p>It is becoming ever more evident that unconscious matter cannot
produce consciousness, while conscious entities can produce phenomena
that behave like unconscious matter. “More” cannot come out of “less,”
though the opposite is clearly possible. Crucially, when consciousness
and free will are irreducible properties of nature, the evolution of the
physical universe can no longer be the work of a “blind watchmaker,” but
the result of cooperating and intelligent conscious entities that have
always existed and are the ultimate cause of the universe’s eternal
becoming.</p>
<p>In this book there is a crucial distinction between conscious and
unconscious knowledge that is generally neglected in the scientific
literature since consciousness is considered epiphenomenal. This
confusion is further facilitated by the lack of appropriate words in the
English language to discriminate the two. In the Italian language there
are two verbs, conoscere and sapere, instead of only “to know.”
Conoscere is a deeper form of knowing than sapere because it refers to
the knowing that is based on experience and comprehension, whereas
sapere can describe the knowing by heart of someone who repeats what he
does not understand. In the Italian version of this book I have
consistently used conoscere with the meaning, “conscious knowledge,” and
sapere to mean “unconscious knowledge,” even though in their common
usage the two verbs are often used interchangeably. In the English
version, I have consistently translated conoscere as “knowing” and
sapere as “knowledge.” This distinction is essential to discriminate
between the symbolic-only knowledge of computers or brains and the
semantic knowing of a conscious entity.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The search for truth must be the ultimate goal of any science.
—Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Seven General Physics Lessons</p>
<p>I am a physicist, inventor, and entrepreneur. I was born in Vicenza,
Italy during the Second World War in a Catholic family and I received a
Laurea degree in physics from the University of Padua in 1965, summa cum
laude.</p>
<p>In 1968, I moved to Silicon Valley, California to work at Fairchild
Semiconductor, where I developed the original silicon gate MOS
technology, the process technology that made possible microprocessors,
dynamic random access memories (DRAM), non-volatile memories, and CCD
image sensors, the key components of the information revolution. In 1970
I moved to Intel where I designed the world’s first microprocessor, the
Intel 4004, and for five years I led the team that created the 8008,
4040, 8080, and other components that have revolutionized information
technology.</p>
<p>In late 1974 I founded Zilog, the world’s first company entirely
dedicated to the microprocessor market, thus starting an entrepreneurial
career that occupied the rest of my professional life. Zilog’s first
microprocessor, the Z80-CPU, became a bestseller and is still in
production today (2022).</p>
<p>During the second half of the 1980s, I became interested in
artificial neural networks and founded Synaptics to develop analog chips
capable of emulating neural networks using floating-gate transistors. At
that time, neural networks were considered a bad idea by the artificial
intelligence (AI) experts. Twenty-five years later, however, they became
the only practical solution to the recognition of complex patterns, a
very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Up to the age of 40, I lived doing what most of us do: I sought
happiness outside myself, convinced that to be happy I would have to
fulfill everything the world prescribes to that end. I buried myself in
work and deeply repressed any interference that might distract me from
my objectives, thinking that the harder the goals, the more happiness
they should bring me if I succeeded.</p>
<p>I rushed to check all the boxes on my imaginary “happiness list,”
pushing down any inner turmoil. I didn’t want to be distracted from my
goals for any reason. I told myself that to be happy, I had to first get
to the end of that list.</p>
<p>I was hostage to a kind of hypnotic trance and I had embraced the
competitive and consumerist vision that dominates our society. I had
lost the connection with my emotions and my inner reality. I had fallen
into the trap most of us fall into.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m sure that, if I hadn’t reached the bottom of the
list, I would have continued to struggle until my death, without ever
realizing that I was confusing an imaginary happiness with a real
one.</p>
<p>It was only because I crossed the finish line and took a break from
the race that I was able to look inside myself. What I found was a deep
suffering that I pretended not to feel. My first reaction was: What’s
wrong with me? How is it possible not to be happy when I have achieved
everything that should make me so?</p>
<p>As Simone Weil says: “Suffering is a door that we can choose to go
through and then we learn something, or we refuse to open, and then
nothing is added, rather, it takes everything away from us.”</p>
<h1 id="the-search-for-truth">The Search for Truth</h1>
<p>While studying neuroscience I wondered if it was possible to build a
conscious computer. If materialism were right—as I then thought—the
answer had to be yes. Therefore I explored all possible ways I could
think of to achieve such a goal, reflecting deeply on the attributes of
awareness. It didn’t take long to recognize the big obstacle: the
complete lack of understanding of the nature of sensations, feelings,
and emotions, what philosophers call qualia. No matter how hard I tried,
I could not find any way to convert the electrical signals of the
computer into qualia, because qualia belong to a different kind of
reality with no apparent connection to symbols. It was like trying to
transform the feeling of love one feels for a child into a computer
program.</p>
<p>I also sensed that the cause of my despair was deeply connected with
the mystery of consciousness and that further motivated me to try to
understand. My situation placed this enigma at the center of my midlife
crisis and led me to an experience of unexpected, unsolicited, and
spontaneous awakening, which made me realize that consciousness is
fundamental and beyond matter.</p>
<p>From that point on, I embarked on a new path of searching for truth,
which led me to investigate all aspects of reality, even those that I
previously had taken for granted and would have never thought of taking
into consideration. I realized that just as I had uncritically accepted
religious dogmas as a child, I also had accepted those of science,
replacing the old dogmas with the new ones.</p>
<p>My awakening experience has already been described in my
autobiography, entitled Silicon: From the invention of the
microprocessor to the new science of consciousness, first published in
Italy in 2019 and in 2021 in USA [1]. For the convenience of the reader,
I report the experience below with minimal changes.</p>
<h1 id="the-awakening">The Awakening</h1>
<p>In December 1990, while I was at Lake Tahoe, California with my
family during the Christmas holidays, I woke up around midnight thirsty.
I poured myself a glass of water from the refrigerator in the kitchen
and, sipping it, I moved into the adjacent living room to contemplate
the lake, now dark and mysterious.</p>
<p>I went back to bed and while I was waiting for sleep to return, I
suddenly felt a powerful rush of energy emerge from my chest like
nothing I had ever experienced before and could not even imagine
possible. This alive energy was love, yet a love so intense and so
incredibly fulfilling that it surpassed any other notion I previously
had about love. Even more surprising was the fact that the source of
this love was me.</p>
<p>I experienced it as a broad beam of shimmering white light, alive and
beatific, gushing from my heart with incredible strength. Then suddenly
that light exploded. It filled the room and expanded to embrace the
entire universe with the same white brilliance. I knew then, without a
shadow of a doubt, that this was the substance out of which everything
that exists is made. This was what created the universe out of itself.
Then, with immense surprise, I recognized that I was that light!</p>
<p>The whole experience lasted perhaps a minute, and it changed me
forever. My relationship with the world had always been as a separate
observer perceiving the universe as outside myself and disconnected from
me. What made this event astonishing was its impossible perspective
because I was both the experiencer and the experience. I was
simultaneously the observer of the world and the world. I was the world
observing itself! And I was concurrently knowing that the world is made
of a “substance” that feels like love and that I am that!</p>
<p>In other words, the essence of reality was revealed to be a
“substance” or nous that knows itself by self-reflection, and its
self-knowing is experienced as an irrepressible and dynamic love full of
joy and peace.</p>
<p>This experience contained an unprecedented force of truth, because it
felt true at all levels of my being. At the physical level, my body was
alive and vibrant like I had never felt before. At the emotional level I
perceived myself as an impossibly powerful source of love, and at the
mental level I knew with certainty that everything is “made of” love.
For the first time in my life I had experienced the existence of another
dimension of reality, a dimension that previously could only be known
intellectually by reading about it, but not by living it: the spiritual
level in which a person is one with the world.</p>
<p>It was a form of direct knowing, stronger than the “certainty”
offered by logic; a knowledge from the inside rather than the outside,
which simultaneously involved all aspects of my consciousness: the
physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels.</p>
<p>I like to think that I have experienced my nature both as a particle
and as a wave, to use an analogy with quantum physics that is impossible
to comprehend with ordinary logic. The particle aspect was the ability
to maintain my identity despite experiencing myself as the world (the
wave aspect). But my identity was also part of the world, because I felt
myself to be the world with “my” point of view. So now I think that my
identity is like one of the infinite points of view with which One—the
totality of what exists —observes and knows itself. In other words, each
one of us is a point of view of One, a part of One indivisible from It
that contains Its essence and, as such, is eternal.</p>
<p>That experience made me understand that, as the famous Lebanese
aphorist Kahlil Gibran said: “Spiritual awakening is the most essential
thing in human life, it is the only purpose of existence.” That
experience has completely changed my life and has retained its original
intensity and clarity over the years. Even today it continues to have a
powerful impact on my life.</p>
<h1 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h1>
<p>Live the questions now. Maybe in the future, gradually, without
noticing, one day away, you will live the answers.</p>
<p>—Rainer Maria Rilke, ‘Be Patient’</p>
<p>The encounter with my spiritual nature began a path of personal
investigation into the nature of my consciousnes, the only one I can
experience and know. Driven by the desire to understand and reconcile
the ineffable unitive experience of awakening with everyday reality, I
worked intensely on myself for the following 20 years, during which I
continued to carry out my professional activity, first as CEO and then
as Chairman of Synaptics.</p>
<p>During that time I thoroughly explored my hitherto neglected inner
reality, and tried to integrate it with the outer reality, living in and
out of the world at the same time, so to speak: “in the world but not of
the world.” I also understood that the experience of the outer world is
based on the reproducibility of shared events, while that of the inner
world is strictly private and can be known by others only to the extent
that we communicate it.</p>
<p>This inner work was the source of many intuitions and spontaneous
transformations of thoughts and attitudes which gradually led me to an
integration and harmonization of the two worlds, changing me profoundly.
The most evident aspect has been the almost complete disappearance of a
type of restlessness and mental anxiety that had always been part of my
inner landscape.</p>
<p>I then began to question the theory that describes us as biological
machines similar to computers because, based on the known laws of
physics, we should be completely unconscious, just like our computers
are. In fact, the taste of wine, the scent of a rose, the color orange,
and the love for a son should not exist, because no scientist can
explain how electrical or biochemical signals can produce these qualia.
The fact that each of us feels them, and “knows” because of them, is
indisputable, and this falsifies the idea that current physical theories
are complete, i.e., they describe all of reality.</p>
<p>We are repeatedly told that we are biological robots, while the
intense personal investigation that occurred after my awakening revealed
otherwise, through many other extraordinary and spontaneous experiences
of consciousness.</p>
<p>I felt that, rather than a body, we are spiritual beings temporarily
imprisoned in a physical structure similar to a highly sophisticated
drone. But if we allow ourselves to be convinced by those who insist we
are only our mortal body, we will end up thinking that everything that
exists originates only in the physical world. In that case we will not
even ask ourselves questions about the nature and purpose of our
creative impulses and emotions. In so doing we will also avoid
investigating the meaning of our life which, as I now understand, is the
most important part of our human existence and experience.</p>
<p>In summary, if we believe that the inanimate matter can explain all
of reality, we will support an assumption already falsified by the fact
that we are conscious.</p>
<p>As I progressed in my study, I gradually realized that, if we
hypothesized that consciousness and free will are irreducible properties
of nature, the scientific vision and narrative of reality would
radically change and legitimize a profound spirituality, with unexpected
consequences for both science and spirituality. But how could such a
drastic change occur?</p>
<p>In my opinion, science should try to answer all our fundamental
questions, not eliminate from reality what it cannot explain. I
therefore decided to devote myself full-time to the scientific study of
consciousness, and, in 2011, I created with my wife the Federico and
Elvia Faggin Foundation to support basic research on consciousness
starting from the premise that it is a fundamental and irreducible
aspect of reality. The stakes are too high not to seriously consider the
hypothesis that consciousness may exist before matter, or perhaps
simultaneously with it.</p>
<h1 id="the-new-science-of-consciousness">The New Science of
Consciousness</h1>
<p>If we start from consciousness, free will, and creativity as
irreducible properties of nature, the whole scientific conception of
reality is overturned. In this new vision, the emotional and intuitive
parts of life—ignored by materialism—return to play a central role.
Aristotle said: “To educate the mind without educating the heart means
not educating at all.” We cannot let physicalism and reductionism define
human nature and leave consciousness out from the description of the
universe.</p>
<p>The physicalist and reductionist premises are perfect for describing
the mechanical and symbolic-informational aspects of reality, but they
are inadequate to explain its semantic aspects. If we insist that these
assumptions describe all of reality, we eliminate a priori what
distinguishes us from our machines and we erase our consciousness, our
freedom and, above all, our humanity from the face of the universe.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we take our inner world seriously and begin to
investigate it with love and determination, we will discover a new
Weltanschauung that promises a creative and cooperative future for
humankind, full of profound satisfactions. Life cannot be defined only
by mere biological aspects, but, above all, by the triumph of the
spiritual nature of the universe which silently guides us.</p>
<p>Quantum physics is already telling us that the universe is holistic
and creative, and the new developments in quantum information theory
justify, as we will see later, a new and revolutionary theory of
consciousness and free will.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the only possible way to explain how the
universe can create life and consciousness is that the universe is
itself alive and conscious from the outset. If you take this hypothesis
seriously, the entire conception of reality is transformed, with
enormous consequences that point to a brilliant and fulfilling future.
Creativity, ethics, free will, and joyful love can only come from
consciouness. The immense mechanical intelligence, beyond the reach of
the human brain, that comes from the machines we have invented will then
add tremendous strength to our wisdom. Otherwise our technology will be
used against humankind by those who promote the materialistic vision of
the survival of the self-proclaimed fittest.</p>

Reality</h1>
<p>In science everything is always different from what it would seem
according to common sense.</p>
<p>—Bertolt Brecht, Life of Galileo</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-world-like">What Is the World Like?</h1>
<p>Today we are still grappling with this question, which human beings
have always asked themselves. For centuries it was believed that the
world consisted of earth, water, air, and fire in various
proportions.</p>
<p>Only in the last hundred years, with the advent of quantum physics,
have we made great strides in understanding the nature of reality. We
have in fact discovered that matter, which seems solid and compact, is
instead made of vibratory energy!</p>
<p>During the last 20 years we have then understood that everything is
made up of quantum information. However, there is still no theory
capable of giving us a vision of the world that is consistent with both
general relativity and quantum physics. In this book I put forward the
hypothesis that the universe has been conscious and had free will
forever. Therefore, nothing is as it appears: Not only is the world much
different than we imagined, but reality is even more unbelievable and
fantastic than we ever thought possible because the evolution of the
universe reflects its ever-increasing selfknowing.</p>
<h1 id="at-the-dawn-of-science">At the Dawn of Science</h1>
<p>Homo sapiens lived a nomadic existence for millennia. Then, about
10,000 years ago, with a flash of intuition, they learned to
“domesticate” vegetation. This led to the birth of agriculture and
caused human beings to settle in ever larger communities, giving rise to
different professions and specializations.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the need to permanently document fleeting verbal
agreements promoted a very important invention: writing.</p>
<p>The first Sumerian cuneiform script dates back to about 5000 years
ago and the first religious-spiritual-philosophical text, the Rigveda,
is about 3500 years old.</p>
<p>Writing also allowed us to record thoughts and ideas to be able to
later reflect on and further develop them, an otherwise nearly
impossible task given the dynamism and limited memory capacity of our
mind. Furthermore, the written thoughts could be faithfully copied and
shared with many other thinkers, and thus spread beyond the fading
boundaries of words which persist only for a few seconds around the
space in which they are pronounced. Writing was a necessary step in the
development and perfecting of cooperative thinking, logic, and
rationality.</p>
<p>About 2500 years ago, Greek philosophers developed rational thinking
to a level never reached before. The philosophical-mathematical ideas of
Pythagoras provided the foundations of physics and mathematics, which
two centuries later brought us Euclid’s Elements, the text that founded
axiomatic mathematics. However, it took almost 2000 years to see the
birth of experimental science, thanks to the awakening of humankind
during the Renaissance, which brought us a new consciousness. Science
and mathematics allowed us to regain freedom of thought, after a long
period in which it was not legitimate to question the religious dogmas
that dominated every act of daily life.</p>
<p>The scientific method was born with the innovative and courageous
ideas of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and many others. By using
observations, mathematical reasoning, and carefully crafted experiments
to validate rational hypotheses, the scientific method allowed
unprecedented progress in our understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Just like matter transformed by writing could faithfully reflect our
ideas back to us, the same matter could also reveal its functioning to
curious and sharp-witted minds who knew what questions to ask and what
experiments to invent. Mathematics, then, made it possible to precisely
formulate the abstract models followed by matter.</p>
<p>During its four centuries of existence, physics has immensely
clarified our ideas about how the physical world functions, and it also
provided the theoretical foundations for the development of many other
scientific disciplines and technologies that have profoundly affected
our life and the planet.</p>
<p>Physics is rooted in the experimental proof of the predictions made
by its mathematical theories, which must be verified (or falsified) by
experiments before they are accepted. Over the years, the physical world
has revealed an ever-increasing complexity and has required the use of
highly sophisticated and abstract mathematical theories, to the point
where physics today resembles applied mathematics rather than the
experimental physics of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, the
experiment has the last word, no matter how elegant or rational is the
mathematical model. If the experiment fails, the beautiful theory must
be changed or abandoned. In fact, Einstein said: “No amount of
experiments will prove that I am right; a single experiment can prove
that I was wrong.”</p>
<p>This pragmatism led to constant progress, especially when new
experiments showed inexplicable anomalies with existing theories. In a
sense, the process is similar to the variation and selection principle
used by life, because the theory surviving the selection made by many
experiments becomes the winning one.</p>
<p>Until the late nineteenth century, classical physics provided the
basic concepts and laws that fueled the industrial revolution. During
the 1930s and 1940s, it also gave birth to the information age, based on
the extraordinarily fertile idea of the computer. Computer technology
then blossomed thanks to the solid-state microelectronics that emerged
from quantum physics, the physics of the twentieth century, applied to
crystals. Each era “rests on the shoulders” of the previous ones, and
the new one is transforming our way of living even more rapidly than the
industrial revolution that preceded it.</p>
<h1 id="the-worldview-of-classical-physics">The Worldview of Classical
Physics</h1>
<p>In the early sixteenth century, Copernicus’s heliocentric system
found direct experimental confirmation in the work of Galileo Galilei,
who turned the newly invented telescope to the sky and discovered four
satellites orbiting Jupiter, and the phases of the planet Venus. His
experiments provided incontrovertible evidence that not all celestial
bodies revolve around the Earth, as was believed according to the
Ptolemaic system.</p>
<p>Galileo gave us the first clear demonstration of the scientific
method, stating that the physical world follows natural laws that can be
expressed with the language of mathematics, an idea that dates back to
Pythagoras. He also stated that mathematical theory must be tested
experimentally, and that the final verdict must be based on the supreme
authority of repeatable experiments. He was also the first scientist to
postulate the invariance of physical laws in any reference frame that
moves with uniform motion (called inertial frame). Galileo also
experimentally derived
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F=m{\cdot}a</annotation></semantics></math>
, the empirical mathematical law that describes the accelerated motion
of terrestrial objects.1</p>
<p>Isaac Newton, born the same year in which Galileo died, conceived the
idea that the physical laws valid on Earth should also apply throughout
the universe. His bold conception allowed him to formulate the law of
universal gravitation and to extend the principles of Galileo’s
mechanics with precise definitions of space, time, mass, force, and
energy. Starting from a purely mathematical theory, Newton then proved
Kepler’s empirical laws describing the motion of the planets around the
Sun. To this end, Newton also invented a new field of mathematics called
differential calculus. This work provided the first example of how to do
theoretical physics, that is, how to do science starting from a general
mathematical theory. From such theory any particular case could be
derived by specifying some parameters and the initial conditions of the
system: an exceptionally fruitful paradigm.</p>
<p>The success of Newton’s mechanics provided the theoretical basis for
a technology that was no longer purely empirical but also based on solid
mathematical foundations, thus leading to and fueling the industrial
revolution.</p>
<p>The scientific method became the new methodology for investigating
nature, and changed the traditional way of thinking. With it,
rationality and experimental evidence superseded speculative and
intuitive thinking, not to mention the respect (or fear) of authority
that characterized previous practice. Scientific positivism became the
new creed, founded on reductionism, materialism, and the absolute faith
in mathematical logic, considered free of internal contradictions. This
vision allowed us to mathematically study with great success many
complex systems by reducing them to the sum of their parts.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-way-of-thinking">A New Way of Thinking</h1>
<p>The intellectual euphoria that characterized the early nineteenth
century can be succinctly described by Pierre-Simon Laplace’s famous
statement in the Introduction to his Essai philosophique sur les
probabilités of 1814:</p>
<p>We can consider the present state of the universe as the effect of
its past and the cause of its future. An intellect that at a certain
moment knew all the forces that set nature in motion and the positions
of all the elements of which nature is composed, if this intellect were
also vast enough to subject these data to analysis, it could embrace in
a single formula the movements of the largest bodies in the universe and
those of the smallest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be
uncertain and the future like the past would be present before his
eyes.</p>
<p>This position of extreme determinism and reductionism was called
“Laplace’s demon” and was also used to claim that free will is an
illusion. This point of view is still prevalent today among most
scientists and philosophers, despite the indeterministic, probabilistic,
and holistic character of quantum physics. I will return to these
crucial points in later chapters.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century marked the maturation of classical physics
with the development of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and
electromagnetism. The latter was a completely new field of physics about
which, just a century earlier, almost nothing was known. The discovery
of electromagnetic waves as oscillations of an “energy field” marked the
triumph of classical theoretical physics. The unsuspected existence of
these waves was first predicted by James Clerk Maxwell’s equations in
1865, and experimentally verified by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 1887.</p>
<p>Electromagnetism changed our fundamental ideas about the nature of
the physical world, previously considered essentially mechanical, and
heralded a new world full of unsuspected technological and application
possibilities.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, classical physics dominated the
scientific view of the world that can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. The physical world is all that exists (naturalism) and its
existence is independent of the observer (realism).<br />
2. Physical reality is created by the interactions of “particles” of
matter in space and time (atomism). These particles are imagined as
Democritus’s atoms: irreducible, indestructible, hard, microscopic,
separate, and ontological objects.<br />
3. Space and time are independent and absolute. They are the stage on
which particles of mass and electricity interact. Mass particles move in
space and time following gravitational and other mechanical forces,
while the movements of electrical particles follow Maxwell’s equations
and produce an electromagnetic field that influences and is influenced
by all other electrical particles.<br />
4. The behavior of a complex system can be completely described as the
sum of the behaviors of all its parts (reductionism).<br />
5. If we know the initial conditions of all the particles of a system,
we can, at least in principle, predict all the past and all the future
evolution of the system (determinism).<br />
6. We live in a static and closed universe in which entropy (disorder)
is constantly increasing.<br />
7. One can observe the world without disturbing it.<br />
8. Mathematics can give us a true and comprehensive description of
reality.<br />
9. The evolution of all living species follows the Darwinian principle
of random variation and natural selection.<br />
10. The nature of mind and matter was debated primarily by philosophers.
Cartesian dualism claimed that mind and matter are completely different
“substances,” while materialism claimed that only matter exists
(monism). For the materialist, the mind is simply one of the functions
performed by the brain.</p>
<p>The materialist was convinced that classical physics would be able to
fully explain the nature of life and consciousness, using the same
method and the same assumptions that had produced the enormous amount of
knowledge and progress witnessed in the previous two centuries.</p>
<h1 id="the-end-of-classical-physics">The End of Classical Physics</h1>
<p>In one of his splendid books, Thornton Wilder said that the bridge of
San Luis Rey—an ancient, aerial, beautiful bridge, the most beautiful in
all of Peru—was apparently part of the things that last forever: it was
unthinkable that it could break. However, one Friday at noon, all of a
sudden, that bridge fell apart.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the fundamental assumptions of
classical physics seemed universal truths, solid, and unassailable. The
remarkable successes of science and technology had brought with them the
false impression of knowing much more than was really known, backing up
the strong belief that those basic ideas and principles were a reliable
guide for the future. On the threshold of the twentieth century, the
famous physicist Lord William Thompson Kelvin had stated: “By now there
is nothing new to discover in physics; all that’s left to do is more and
more precise measurements.” And this certainty (some would say
arrogance) was expressed despite the presence of some anomalies that
classical physics could not explain, and which would soon cause the
collapse of the entire intellectual structure of classical physics.</p>
<p>It took a quarter of a century to explain the phenomenology of these
persistent anomalies, and to do so it became necessary to replace almost
all the fundamental assumptions of classical physics. This profound
revision led us to special and general relativity and to quantum
mechanics: a new physics that replaced determinism and reductionism with
indeterminism and holism.</p>
<p>However, the needed change in perspective was so difficult to accept
that, a century later, we are still trying to come to terms with the
conceptual revolution brought about by these new theories. In
particular, we still have difficulty understanding the indeterminism of
quantum physics, which has eliminated the possibility of knowing the
whole truth about the physical world: not only in practice, but also in
principle. The interpretation of reality provided by classical physics
could not have been more wrong!</p>
<p>In 1899 three main phenomena were unexplainable by classical physics:
black body radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the Lorentz
transformations.</p>
<p>Black body radiation refers to the frequency spectrum of the light
emitted by a hot object as a function of its temperature. The anomalous
behavior of this radiation2 was explained by Max Planck in the year 1900
using a mathematical device that at first seemed unjustified. Planck
found that, if the exchange of energy between matter and radiation had
occurred only in integer multiples of a discrete value of energy—called
the quantum of energy—then the mystery would be solved, at least
mathematically. In other words, Planck hypothesized that there must be a
minimum energy exchange, greater than zero, and proportional to the
frequency of the radiation, and that all exchanges should occur in
integer multiples of this minimum. Fractional quanta were not
allowed.</p>
<p>In 1905, a young Albert Einstein was able to explain the
photoelectric effect3 by assuming that the interaction between light and
matter that produces electrons is caused by “particles of light” having
energy quanta provided by the Planck relation. Einstein hypothesized
that light, when interacting with the atoms of matter, behaves like many
particles, and not like a wave, as Thomas Young had shown almost 100
years earlier.</p>
<p>Einstein’s explanation contradicted the established principles of
classical physics and earned him the Nobel Prize. The quantum of light
was later called a photon and its implications were astounding. Hence
photons were found to have a double personality because they acted both
as particles and as waves: an almost contradictory and quite disturbing
behavior. According to Einstein, the energy
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>E</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math>
, needed to extract an electron from an atom, had to come from a single
collision with a “particle of light,” whose quantum of energy had to be
equal to, or greater than,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>E</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math>
. Furthermore, that energy could not originate from a sum of quanta in
which each quantum had energy less than
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>E</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math>
; it had to be a single-event process. This intuition explained why the
photoelectric effect had a threshold that depended only on the frequency
of the incident light and not on its intensity.</p>
<p>The profound impact of Einstein’s explanation was to show that light
could be understood as composed of many individual photons which did not
lose their individuality once they were added.</p>
<p>In 1905 Albert Einstein also explained the mysterious Lorentz
transformation, i.e., the fact that the objects described by Maxwell’s
equations violate the simple Galilean inertial transformation when their
relative speed is close to that of light. This anomaly was elegantly
solved by assuming that the speed of light,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>
, is the same in all inertial frames of reference, i.e., those frames
that move at a constant speed. The consequences of this simple
assumption were devastating, because it was discovered that time and
space, considered independent and absolute since Newton’s time, depended
instead on the relative velocity between observer and observed. As their
relative speed approached
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>
, the time marked by a clock that was part of the observed system slowed
down and the length of a stick aligned with the direction of motion was
shortened, as compared to the time and length of identical clocks and
sticks within the observer’s frame of reference!</p>
<p>This theory was called special relativity. According to it, no
material object with mass m greater than zero could accelerate and reach
a speed equal to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>
, because its mass would increase without limit as its relative speed
approached
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>c</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math>
.</p>
<p>Einstein also discovered that the notion of simultaneity of events
was not as absolute as it was thought, but was relative to the motion of
the observer. For example, when an observer A sees event 1 happen before
event 2, a second observer B, who moves with respect to A, could see
event 1 happen after event 2! The concept of causality also lost its
absolute status.</p>
<p>Finally, Einstein discovered that the rest mass of an object m and
its energy
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>E</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math>
are proportional, according to the famous relation
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E=m c^{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
. The mass of a resting particle is therefore energy confined into a
microscopic portion of space. Incredible!</p>
<p>After 1905, physics could never be the same.</p>
<h1 id="the-revelation-of-a-new-world">The Revelation of a New
World</h1>
<p>In 1911 Lord Ernest Rutherford discovered that the atom, considered a
particle of solid and indivisible matter since the time of Democritus,
turned out to be almost empty and divisible, composed of a tiny nucleus
surrounded by electrons, similar to a miniature solar system. Two years
later, Niels Bohr was able to explain the discrete spectrum of light
emitted or absorbed by a hydrogen atom by combining Maxwell’s equations,
Rutherford’s discoveries, and Einstein’s photon in a semiclassical
theory. Once again the incredible fecundity of Planck’s quantum of
action was confirmed by revealing a further quantum aspect of the real
world, in contrast to the continuum described by classical physics.</p>
<p>In 1915 Einstein completed his theory of general relativity (GR),
showing that the gravitational force could be explained as a geometric
effect on spacetime due to the mass of objects. Consequently, when a
planet orbits a star, it actually moves in a “straight line,” but since
the surrounding space is “curved” by the enormous mass of the star, the
planet ends up moving in an elliptical orbit around it. The physics
community was stunned!</p>
<p>GR can be concisely described in the words of physicist John
Archibald Wheeler: “Space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells
space-time how to bend.” In other words, the global distribution of
matter affects the local properties of spacetime, and the local
properties of spacetime determine how matter moves. When matter moves
locally, its global distribution changes, and this in turn changes the
local properties of spacetime.</p>
<p>It almost looks like a “snake biting its tail,” yet the same analogy
can also illustrate how electromagnetic waves propagate, because a
change in the electric field causes a change in the magnetic field, and
a change in the magnetic field causes a change in the electric field.
These reciprocal changes occurring within the electromagnetic field, a
real but immaterial “field,” cause the propagation of a wave in
spacetime without the need for any physical means. At the end of the
nineteenth century it was thought that waves required a medium such as
air or water to propagate. Sound waves, for example, cannot propagate in
a vacuum. Therefore, empty space was thought to be filled with a
“luminiferous ether,” a physical medium capable of vibrating to carry
light waves. A famous experiment in 1887 by Albert Michelson and Edward
Morley showed instead that the ether did not exist. Einstein’s special
relativity theory was in fact motivated by the desire to understand the
consequences of the experimental absence of the ether.</p>
<p>GR expresses the existence of feedback from the whole to the parts as
well as the existence of feedforward from the parts to the whole.
Feedback is a top-down influence in which the global distribution of
matter (the whole) determines the local properties of spacetime that
inform the local behavior of matter (the parts). Feedforward is a
bottom-up influence in which the local behavior of the matter determines
the future global distribution of the matter that constitutes the
whole.</p>
<p>GR contradicts the principles of classical physics, in which space
and time are absolute and the behavior of the whole is determined solely
by the behavior of the parts, meaning that only feedforward exists. The
story does not end here, however, because the first decades of the
twentieth century had many other big surprises in store.</p>
<h1 id="quantum-mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</h1>
<p>In 1926 Erwin Schrödinger extended the principle of minimum action4
to the quantum reality that was gradually emerging, and his wave
equation gave birth to quantum mechanics. The discrete solutions of the
Schrödinger equation are called wave functions, and represent the
temporal evolution of the state of a system, for example a particle.
Furthermore, the square of the absolute value of a wave function defines
the probability of finding such a particle in a certain region of
space.</p>
<p>We owe this probabilistic interpretation of the wave function to Max
Born, who formulated it in the same year (1926). Interestingly, Max Born
and Werner Heisenberg had developed matrix mechanics in 1925, a
different formulation of quantum physics, which later proved to be
equivalent to Schrödinger’s wave mechanics.</p>
<p>Two years later, Heisenberg postulated the “uncertainty principle.”
It is a mathematical relationship that shows the impossibility of
measuring two “conjugate” variables with arbitrary precision, such as
the position and momentum of a particle, or the energy and time of the
same.5</p>
<p>The precious determinism of classical physics was falsified where it
hurt most, because the nature of the elementary particles that should
have determined everything else proved itself to be indeterministic and
probabilistic. The theory no longer tells us the specific state that
will manifest but only its probability. This is a different type of
“indeterminism” than the one expressed by the Heisenberg principle,
revealing an irreducible knowledge gap between the quantum evolution of
the system and its measurement. This gap is called “the measurement
problem” of quantum physics because it requires something to occur
between the quantum system and the measuring apparatus—called the
“collapse of the wave function”— which is not described by the theory.
Much has been written about this problem, and yet there is still no
solution that a majority of physicists agree upon.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Pauli, Nobel Prize in Physics, said in his speech on 13
December 1946: “I was not spared the shock that every physicist
accustomed to the classical way of thinking suffered when he first heard
of the fundamental postulate of Bohr’s quantum theory.” And, in 1950, in
a letter to</p>
<p>A. Pais, Pauli wrote: “It is my personal opinion that for the science
of the future, reality will be neither psychic nor physical: in some
way, it will be both and neither one of them.”</p>
<p>In 1928 Paul Dirac combined Schrödinger’s non-relativistic equation
with Heisenberg-Born’s matrix mechanics, and extended it to the
relativistic case, thus creating the first quantum field theory of
electrons. His equation predicted the existence of antielectrons
(positrons), which were later discovered experimentally.</p>
<p>Physical reality was gradually revealing a completely unsuspected
nature.</p>
<h1 id="the-end-of-certainty">The End of Certainty</h1>
<p>In conjunction with the many shocking discoveries in physics,
extraordinary developments were also occurring in the field of
mathematics. It was the mathematician Kurt Gödel in 1931 who delivered
the coup de grâce to the logical positivism that dominated the
philosophical-scientific thought at the end of the nineteenth century.
Gödel demonstrated the incompleteness of mathematics, proving that
classical logic was insufficient to establish the truth of all possible
statements that obeyed the rules of an axiomatic system sufficiently
complex to contain arithmetic.</p>
<p>Having proved that there are undecidable sentences, that is,
sentences that cannot be formally proved to be either true or false
without introducing new axioms, Gödel’s theorem eliminated the
completeness and absolute certainty that mathematics was thought to
have.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of mathematics, which is often
underestimated, is that the truth of its statements is entirely based on
the unproven truth of the set of axioms on which there is agreement.
These axioms are in fact considered self-evident truths, accepted as
such by convention because their truth cannot be proven. The presumed
objectivity of mathematics is therefore based on the subjective
acceptance of what is considered self-evident. It is therefore
legitimate to have some doubts about the absolute certainty that we can
attribute to mathematical statements, especially when they are applied
to the real world.</p>
<p>In fact, with quantum physics the world ceased to behave in a
selfevident way! How, then, can we choose the postulates of quantum
physics when we have yet to solve the measurement problem? Self-evidence
lost its supposed universal validity. The physicist Leon Max Lederman
put it this way: “It is not the uncertainty of measurement that hides
reality; on the contrary, it is reality itself that never provides
certainties in the classicalGalilean sense of the term, when examining
phenomena at the atomic scale.”</p>
<p>In the 1960s, mathematicians rediscovered and formalized another
great surprise: chaotic systems. A chaotic system is a system whose
behavior depends so sensitively on its initial conditions that it
diverges exponentially when tiny variations of those conditions occur.
Said differently, to predict the future behavior of a chaotic system, it
is necessary to know the initial conditions with more precision than is
possible to know, even in principle, given Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle.</p>
<p>This means that even simple classical systems, such as three objects
in mechanics,6 can behave in a chaotic way. Before the discovery of
chaotic systems, determinism was considered synonymous with
predictability. Classical physics is deterministic, but now we know that
determinism is necessary, but not sufficient, to guarantee
predictability because chaotic systems stop being predictable after a
while. Laplace’s characterization of reality was erroneously based on
the idea that predictability and determinism were synonymous. Laplace’s
demon, the powerful intellect that in principle could have known
everything, turned out to be an illusion.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that any mathematical theory of physical reality is
a valid model only within certain limits, and therefore it is not
totally dependable. The real world outclasses any attempt to completely
describe it.</p>
<p>2 According to classical physics, the amount of electromagnetic
radiation emitted by a body in thermal equilibrium with the environment
(called “black body”) had to increase without limit as the frequency
increased, whereas the measured behavior tended to zero. This was such a
glaring discrepancy that it was called the “ultraviolet catastrophe.” At
the beginning of the twentieth century, this anomaly was a big thorn in
the side of physics.<br />
3 The photoelectric effect is produced when a beam of intense light
illuminates matter and produces electrons. The puzzling and unexplained
behavior was the following: when the light frequency was below a certain
value, there was no emission, even when the light intensity was very
high. Maxwell’s equations instead predicted that the number of electrons
should be proportional to the intensity of light without regard to its
frequency.<br />
4 The principle of least action is central to physics and has been
applied to mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and string
theory. It is quite technical and difficult to explain correctly without
high-level math. To give an intuitive but imprecise understanding,
imagine a mechanical system undergoing a change from an initial to a
final configuration. The principle of least action states that, of all
the possible paths that a system could follow, the path taken is the one
that minimizes the action, where action is defined as the path integral
of the system’s energy over time.<br />
5 A detailed explanation of the key concepts and terms used by quantum
physics can be found in the Glossary at the end of the book.<br />
6 The “three bodies problem” in classical physics is the following: when
three objects interact gravitationally, there are regimes of initial
conditions (the position and the linear and angular momentum of each
object) in which the behavior can be stable, unstable, or chaotic. The
behavior is actually chaotic for most of the initial conditions.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-quantum-reality-1">The Nature of Quantum
Reality</h1>
<p>The universe is not made up of things, but of vibratory energy
networks that emerge from something even deeper and more subtle. —Werner
Karl Heisenberg</p>
<p>Between 1928 and the late 1960s, Dirac’s quantum field theory was
extended to the interactions between electrons and photons (quantum
electrodynamics, or QED theory) and later to nuclear interactions
involving the strong and the electroweak forces (quantum chromodynamics,
or QCD theory). Finally, in 1975, the Standard Model of quantum physics
emerged, according to which there are six quarks for the strong
interaction and six leptons for the weak one. Each quark and each lepton
have an antiparticle, and the interactions between particles are
mediated by the gauge bosons—the carriers of the strong, the electroweak
(two bosons), and the electromagnetic force—and by the Higgs boson, the
carrier of mass.</p>
<p>Therefore, all that exists are spacetime, described by general
relativity, and 17 quantum fields, described by quantum field theory
(QFT). Each elementary particle is an excited state of the homonymous
field. Within QFT the particles are no longer objects and the ontology
resides in the fields, away from the particles of classical physics.</p>
<h1 id="quantum-field-theory-and-general-relativity">Quantum Field
Theory and General Relativity</h1>
<p>According to QFT, elementary particles, atoms, molecules, proteins,
cells, organs, and living organisms constitute hierarchical
organizations of states belonging to the quantum fields, with
ever-growing complexity. These fields have space and time in common and
are the fundamental entities that, interacting with each other, create
everything that exists physically. For example, all the electrons in our
body and in the rest of the universe are waves or “quantum states” of
the same quantum field of electrons. Each quantum wave describes the
superposition of the possible states of an electron with probabilities
specified by the square of the amplitude of the component waves
representing each state.</p>
<p>I know that this explanation seems far-fetched; however, for the
moment there is no simpler way to express it.</p>
<p>The view of the universe that emerges from the description of quantum
states (particles) is very strange, because the variables assume a
defined value only when two particles interact, but none of the
variables are defined prior to their interaction. Furthermore, the basis
of reality is indetermination and granularity instead of continuity. A
particle behaves like a probability wave that can take all possible
paths, and thus it may be found in a volume of space, rather than moving
with a precise trajectory.</p>
<p>However, the probability wave has little in common with the waves of
classical physics, which are collective phenomena produced by a vast
number of classical particles. In other words, particles do not exist as
we imagined them, for they can only be described as probability waves
that allow us to predict the probabilities of all possible states in
which they could be detected. And yet the specific state that will
manifest is not predicted by the theory when the “collapse of the wave
function” occurs.</p>
<p>Today, quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR)
constitute the two pillars of theoretical physics. However, GR describes
a classical and continuous field rather than a discrete quantum field,
in contrast to the fundamental quantization of the other three forces of
nature. For more than 70 years the community of theoretical physicists
has labored to unify QFT with GR, but so far without success despite
enormous efforts. If that unification were to happen, it would describe
spacetime, the gravitational force and all the quantum fields as a
single unified field.</p>
<h1 id="particles-are-waves-of-probability">Particles Are Waves of
Probability</h1>
<p>When physicists say that “a particle interferes with itself,” they
mean that the probability waves that describe the possible states of a
particle interfere with each other when they are allowed to take more
than one path. This is the case with the famous and puzzling double-slit
experiment. The interference produces a probability of finding an
electron in a large region of space, telling us that the electron cannot
be a classical particle that moves along a well-defined trajectory, but
behaves instead like a “probability cloud” described by the wave
function.</p>
<p>In this experiment, particles are sent one at a time through a
barrier with two slits and are detected on a screen placed on the other
side of the barrier. If particles were classical, each of them would
always pass through one of the two slits and would be detected in a
small portion of the screen corresponding to each of the slits. However,
a quantum particle behaves like a probability wave. When the wave hits
the barrier, it splits into two branches that combine and produce an
interference pattern, much like when we throw two stones into a pond.
The square of the amplitude of the combined wave hitting the screen
represents the probability of detecting the particle at the various
points of the screen.</p>
<p>Amazingly, even an atom or a macromolecule can interfere with itself!
This experiment clearly shows that the particle is not a tiny ball, even
though it is always detected in a point of the screen. In other words,
when the particle is not observed, it can be represented as a cloud of
probability, but this does not mean it is a cloud. When it is finally
observed, the particle always behaves like a little ball, but this does
not mean it is a ball. What is it then? No one knows. When a quantum
particle is not observed, it cannot be located in space like a classical
particle, otherwise it could not pass through both slits at the same
time. What “crosses” both slits is a “probability wave,” which is a
representation of the particle, not the particle as a wave.</p>
<p>In other words, we know next to nothing about what a particle is when
it is not measured. The probability wave does not describe the particle,
but what we can know about the particle when we measure it. The wave
only gives us the probability of detecting the particle at every point
on the screen.</p>
<p>But knowing the probability does not tell us where the particle will
actually hit the screen. To show that a particle “behaves like a wave,”
we have to repeat the experiment with many particles all prepared the
same way. Then, each particle will hit the screen at different points,
and collectively they will show the interference pattern calculated by
the mathematical theory.</p>
<p>Quantum theory therefore allows us to calculate very well the
interference pattern produced by a large number of particles, but it
cannot tell us where each particle will manifest itself. A quantum
particle behaves like an extremely complex system, not like a classical
particle, and quantum physics cannot describe the trajectory of a single
particle, not because the theory is incomplete, but for the simple
reason that quantum particles are not objects. They are “something” we
have yet to fully understand.</p>
<h1 id="we-dont-know-what-a-particle-is">We Don’t Know What a Particle
Is</h1>
<p>Classical physics described physical reality as if its description
were the truth. It described instead the illusory model of reality
created by our senses. Quantum physics does not describe reality either.
It can only tell us what we can know about a deeper reality that always
presents itself as “particles,” quanta, in our measurements. This also
includes electromagnetic waves that manifest only as photons, i.e., as
particles. In other words, the probability waves of quantum physics do
not describe reality but only what we can possibly measure of a deeper
reality that manifests itself in the spacetime screen of our senses.</p>
<p>It is astounding to find that a classical object that we thought was
real is instead the collective behavior of gazillions of invisible and
interacting probability waves that do not exist as such in our world
until they manifest as particles in spacetime. Where and how, then, do
“particles” exist when we do not observe them? And what makes them show
up as particles?</p>
<p>Quantum particles reserved another great surprise because they can do
something that no classical particle can do: they can be “entangled.”
This phenomenon consists in the existence of particles that have joint
properties. For example, two electrons can have their magnetic spin
entangled in such a way that the sum of the two spins must be 0.
Therefore, if we measure the spin of electron A and find that it is
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>+</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">+1/2</annotation></semantics></math>
, the spin of electron B will simultaneously be
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>−</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1/2</annotation></semantics></math>
, and vice versa. These are called entangled states.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that, when the spin of A is measured, this
measurement disturbs A in an unpredictable way, so much so that the
probability of obtaining
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>+</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">+1/2</annotation></semantics></math>
or
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>−</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1/2</annotation></semantics></math>
is the same, just like when we toss a fair coin. But then, how does B
instantly know, regardless of its distance from A, that the measure of A
gave
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>+</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">+1/2</annotation></semantics></math>
when it could just as likely have been
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>−</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>?</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1/2?</annotation></semantics></math>
The principle of locality is no longer respected since no influence
should move faster than the speed of light. No one can explain why the
spins of the distant particles are always correlated, regardless of
their distance, and without particle A being able to communicate with
B.</p>
<p>Yet this phenomenon cannot be exploited to communicate faster than
the speed of light for, to communicate, Alice must have control over the
message it sends to Bob and this is impossible given the 50-50
probabilistic behavior of the particles. If classical correlated states
existed before the measurement, by repeating the measurement on many
similarly prepared systems, the percentage of correlations should not
exceed a certain maximum value determined by Bell’s theorem. Entangled
quantum systems, however, may exceed this limit. The only way to explain
this phenomenon is that the state of the two systems cannot exist prior
to the measurement; it must be created during the measurement process.
How correlations can violate Bell’s theorem is still a mystery (see also
the entry Quantum entanglement in the Glossary).</p>
<p>This quantum property is called nonlocality, because it behaves as if
the two particles were a single system manifesting in two different
positions as if space did not exist. In other words, while the physical
result of the measurement can propagate only at the speed of light, the
“knowledge” by the two-particle is instantaneous. Entanglement is
telling us that spacetime may not be what we generally imagine it to be,
since these nonlocal properties are inexplicable.</p>
<h1 id="the-worldview-of-quantum-physics">The Worldview of Quantum
Physics</h1>
<p>The world as we created it is the result of our thinking. We cannot
change it without changing our way of thinking.</p>
<p>—Albert Einstein</p>
<p>The changes to our worldview brought about by a century of scientific
breakthroughs have been so numerous and astonishing that their
implications have yet to be fully metabolized. In summary, the physical
world described by contemporary physics has the following extraordinary
properties:</p>
<p>1. Nature is not continuous, but discrete. There is a limit to the
divisibility of space, time, and matter. All properties, both of fields
and states (particles), are discrete. The fundamental nature of physical
reality is quantum.<br />
2. Elementary particles appear in spacetime only when fields are excited
or interact with other fields. Particles do not exist as objects, but
only as excited states of the homonymous fields.<br />
3. When an interaction occurs between two quantum systems, the states of
both will change, with the creation of an “entangled state,” having new
properties that are not the sum of the properties of the component
states. For example, when the electron field interacts with the proton
field, the result could be a hydrogen atom, a structure with entirely
new properties.<br />
4. Indeterminism is an irreducible property of nature. We cannot measure
two non-commutable variables at the same time, and we cannot even
predict where a particle will be, not even in principle. We can only
predict the probabilities of finding a particle in a certain region of
space.<br />
5. A measuring apparatus that interacts with a quantum system is a
quantum-classical system that amplifies the result of a quantum
interaction to produce a classical signal that can be shared. The</p>
<p>many states that are possible in the quantum world will
“collapse”</p>
<p>into a single reality in our physical world. However, the specific
state that will occur cannot be predicted before the measurement, unless
the probability of occurrence is 1.<br />
6. Particles are not subject to “forces” as classical physics describes.
Quantum particles interact by exchanging other particles. In this way
they behave as if there were a force acting between them.<br />
7. Physical reality is described by a set of fields subject to the laws
of quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR). Everything we
observe derives from the action of these laws upon the fields.<br />
8. The union of QFT and GR in a single coherent theory promises to
reduce physical reality to a single unified quantum field. However, this
theory does not yet exist.<br />
9. Nonlocality reveals the existence of a totality that cannot be
divided into separable parts. This totality escapes any human
description or representation because it cannot be described by the
properties of its separate parts. A compound quantum system has
properties that are incompatible with any property of its parts. This
type of holism does not exist in classical systems because the
properties of a classical system are compatible with the properties of
its parts [2].</p>
<p>The impact of nonlocality, quantum uncertainty, and the
incompleteness of mathematics is enormous:</p>
<p>1. There is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between an element
of theory and an element of reality. Determinism and reductionism do not
exist, not even in principle.<br />
2. Reality is one. Its existence is manifested in the interactions with
observers that are indivisible parts of the same reality. Moreover, the
idea that reality exists whether we observe it or not (realism) is
false. The local realism that Albert Einstein strongly supported has</p>
<p>been proved false.1 In the words of John Archibald Wheeler: “No
phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.”</p>
<p>3. Reality is continually created by the interactions that take place
between its “parts” (parts that are not separable, however). And each
observation changes both the observer and the observed. There is no
privileged position: in an interaction of two “parts,” the positions of
observer and observed are symmetrical.</p>
<p>As Werner Heisenberg said: “The idea of an objective real world whose
smaller parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees
exist, regardless of whether we observe them or not…is impossible.”</p>
<p>According to Wheeler, “The term ‘observer’ should be replaced by the
term ‘participant.’ This replacement could indicate the radically new
role of consciousness in physics…subjective and objective reality in a
sense create each other.” It is legitimate, on the basis of his
reflections, to ask ourselves whether “It is possible that the universe
in a strange sense is ‘brought to light’ by the participation of those
who participate.”</p>
<p>Nonlocality implies that the Whole cannot be the subject of
scientific investigation, not even in principle. There is an “epistemic
horizon of events,” which precludes the Whole being entirely derivable
from the properties of its parts. The Whole is more than the sum of its
parts. By breaking down the Whole into parts (reductionism), we create a
model that differs from the Whole according to how we have divided
it.</p>
<h1 id="a-monistic-conception-of-the-universe">A Monistic Conception of
the Universe</h1>
<p>The Cartesian dualism proposed a vision of reality in which mind and
matter are fundamentally separate substances. Materialism is a monism
based on classical physics, which identifies reality with the matter
from which the mind also derives. The mind, however, is considered
epiphenomenal because only matter can influence reality. Idealism, on
the other hand, is a philosophical monism that supports the idea that
the mind is fundamental and that matter derives from mind. Hence, the
mind “commands” matter.</p>
<p>There is another position in which mind-and-matter are two
irreducible aspects of the same reality, that is, they are like two
sides of the same coin that cannot be separated. It is a form of
panpsychism that I will talk about a lot in the second part of the book.
This is a monism that is like the waveparticle nature of quantum
physics, i.e., the two complementary and irreducible aspects of the same
entity. I think that the universe, in its essence, must contain the
seeds of both mind and matter. Mind and matter are like the inner and
the outer surfaces of a sphere, and ontology belongs to the whole sphere
and not just to what can be observed from the outside or from the
inside.</p>
<p>The whole of current physics corresponds to the unified field that
combines QFT with GR to describe the outer physical reality, what we
call matter, but also includes energy, space, and time. My position is
that physics needs to also deal with the interiority of reality, what we
call mind, which includes consciousness, free will, and life in its most
general manifestation.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-know">How Do We Know?</h1>
<p>The only task of science is to light the way. —Mikhail Bakunin</p>
<p>What proof do we have that we perceive reality as it is? How do we
decide that something exists and has certain properties worth exploring?
How do we determine that a particular search makes sense?</p>
<p>It always starts from our conscious experience of the world and from
our inborn desire to understand and to imagine, together with our
ability to reason. This allows us to make assumptions about what the
“objects of reality” are and how they interact. We do this by replacing
physical objects with mental abstractions, and then constructing
theories that attempt to explain our experience by making predictions
that may or may not be verified. In the event that the predictions do
not correspond to the experience,</p>
<p>we must go back to where we went wrong and change something.<br />
Discovering and fixing anomalies is what often allows us to make
progress.</p>
<p>In the last few millennia, our reasoning has been formalized with the
concept of an axiomatic system exemplified by Euclidean geometry. This
method makes it possible to logically prove the truth of a sentence on
the basis of the presumed truth of a small number of axioms or
postulates. In mathematics, the objects of study and the choice of
axioms come from our intuition, whose origin is a mystery. The axioms
are statements assumed to be true without proof, because they are held
to be self-evident. But would an axiom be self-evident to a monkey or to
a computer? When we believe that “A” is self-evident, we assume that the
way we imagine or perceive A corresponds to reality. This is an
understandable position, but it could also be wrong.</p>
<p>We create the mathematical axioms, but the physical world is not our
work, so the world could be very different from what we think is
selfevident. Quantum theory has amply shown to us that the reality of
classical physics, considered almost universally self-evident a century
ago, turned out to be a great self-deception. In fact, the deception is
so convincing that many scientists still refuse to fully accept the
disturbing philosophical and interpretative implications of phenomena
such as quantum superposition, entanglement, and indeterminism.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, most scholars were sure that classical physics
faithfully represented the ontology of the universe, but then, the
experimental evidence that falsified the postulates of classical physics
required new axioms which barely make sense to the insiders, never mind
to the rest of us. How do we know then that the new axioms are correct?
The only way to know is to falsify the predictions of the theory that is
based on those axioms. But how do we choose the new axioms to replace
those that have been falsified? What is it that makes us know? Does a
robot know?</p>
<h1 id="semantic-and-symbolic-knowledge">Semantic and Symbolic
Knowledge</h1>
<p>I know I exist because I am aware of knowing what I affirm to know,
i.e., that I exist. This is Descartes’ cogito ergo sum: I know I exist
because I experience “existing.” I call this type of knowledge direct
semantic knowledge, because it refers to my own private experience: it
is a reflection of my consciousness upon itself and produces qualia
whose meaning is, “I exist.”</p>
<p>I call indirect semantic knowledge that which refers to knowledge
obtained by observing the external world through my senses. For example,
I can say that I saw a dog because I experienced it in my consciousness
by looking at it. Indirect semantic knowledge, however, does not assure
us that what we know is completely true. It is only a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for knowing the truth.</p>
<p>A machine, on the other hand, “knows” without knowing that it knows
and without even knowing what it means to know. Its knowing is
unconscious and mechanical and cannot be called knowledge: it is simply
information made up of meaningless symbols, which can be mechanically
linked to some other deterministic information or action. The robot’s
actions do not involve free and conscious choices made by the “robot” as
an independent entity from the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>I should point out that we too have the same type of automatic
behavior as robots in many situations, for example when we drive a car.
In this case, together with the pure symbolic information that a robot
has, we also have the conscious experience of the landscape, the road,
and the situation in which we find ourselves. Consciousness performs the
function of supervisor of the mechanical processes of our body. It does
not contribute to driving, however, unless it is necessary to intervene,
in which case it takes over the conditional autonomy it granted to the
body.</p>
<p>It is consciousness that understands the situation and therefore
“knows” when to intervene. And this makes all the difference between a
robot and a human being.</p>
<p>In a robot, there is no conscious self-reflection that is independent
of the algorithmic program and can thus change the decisions hardwired
in the program. In a robot, there is no “self” and no self-witness. In a
machine there is no “pause for reflection” between symbols and action,
because only within our consciousness can we find the meaning of
symbols, a possible doubt, and the free will to choose differently than
the dictates of the mechanism.</p>
<p>There is a clear distinction within us between the symbolic
“knowledge” of the machine and our semantic knowledge. The first is not
knowledge but objective information that can be copied and shared; the
second is a subjective and private experience that occurs in the
intimacy of a conscious entity. As such, semantic knowledge is a dynamic
state of consciousness that contains within itself also the sense of its
own dependability, i.e., the sense of how much one can trust one’s own
knowledge.</p>
<p>I know that I know; I know that I don’t know; I also know when I am
not sure I know and when I pretend to know. Semantic knowledge is a
property of a conscious entity; it is not a property of a machine.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-consciousness-good-for">What Is Consciousness Good
For?</h1>
<p>It is our consciousness that makes us human. Without it we would be
acting as a robot, and life would have no meaning.</p>
<p>—David Chalmers</p>
<p>Someone might ask: “What good is consciousness if a robot can drive a
car better than us?” This is a typical question based on the assumption
that we are biological machines existing in a world governed by the laws
of classical physics and by the survival of the fittest. If we believe
in this interpretation of reality, any subjective value will appear
illusory to us. Within this perspective, our inner experience, emotions,
dreams, aspirations, joys, sorrows, curiosity, music, art, love for
life, and our rare but exhilarating sense of oneness with the universe
and with all of life are only illusions.</p>
<p>But how can we compare ourselves to a mechanism when a living cell is
not even close to a mechanism like a computer? Have you ever seen a
computer give birth to another computer, hardware and software
included?</p>
<p>Have those who promote the idea that computers might become conscious
someday ever given you a convincing explanation of how this might
happen?</p>
<p>Are you willing to throw away everything that gives meaning and
purpose to your life for an idea based on the desire of materialists to
uphold their belief? How can consciousness arise “somehow” when the
complexity of a classical system becomes big enough? How can complexity
generate consciousness and free will from a deterministic system? What
is the mechanism by which a new quality emerges from something that does
not possess such a quality? At most, complexity is a necessary condition
to harbor consciouness, but not to create it!</p>
<p>Do you believe that large and complex computers that contain millions
of microprocessors and consume megawatts of energy are conscious?</p>
<p>Each one of us can say, “I am conscious,” not because we repeat a
meaningless collection of bits from memory, like a computer would, but
because the meaning of that sentence exists prior to the words we
pronounce. Meaning is also the reason why words exist. And consciousness
is what allows us to know the meaning of the symbols that our senses
capture. Consciousness also gives us the freedom of choice that many
scientists and philosophers consider illusory because it is falsified by
the axioms of classical physics that they have chosen to accept.</p>
<p>If the only reality we admit is the one we can measure with rulers
and clocks, we have already eliminated the inner reality that makes us
love life and enjoy the great gift of human existence. By doing so, we
accept the prejudice of those who consider real only what is repeatable
and measurable in a laboratory, i.e., the idea that only objective
reality exists, whereupon consciousness and free will are declared
illusions despite the evidence of their existence within each of us. I
am referring to our thoughts, emotions, sensations, feelings, common
sense, and creativity, the phenomena that no machine possesses.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi liked to say: “I don’t need to go far to look for the
sacred cave, I carry it inside me.” Why do we want to give credit to
those who want to convince us otherwise? We need to wake up from this
sort of trance and trust instead our inner voice, which whispers the
words of</p>
<p>Richard Bach in A Bridge to Eternity: “Intuition does not lie when it
whispers to us: ‘You are not dust, you are magic!’” You are not a
machine! You are consciousness! And, as Gautama Buddha said: “When you
find out who you are, you will laugh at what you thought you were…” I am
convinced that when our rationality is uniquely informed by the
principles of materialism, reductionism, and the survival of the
fittest, it can only lead us to unbridled competition, racism, and war.
Indeed what has characterized much of human history. However, the
unconsciousness of robots and the discoveries of quantum physics are
telling us that materialism and reductionism are only approximations of
a deeper and more mysterious reality, something we have yet to recognize
and understand.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-machines-1">The Nature of Machines</h1>
<p>One day the machines will be able to solve all the problems, but none
of them will ever be able to pose one.</p>
<p>—Albert Einstein</p>
<p>I remember that when I was a kid I was fascinated by machines, so
much so that I used to run to the balcony of the house to see the steam
locomotives pass by, as they announced with a prolonged whistle their
approach to the railroad bridge not far from my home. Machines, and
especially airplanes, have always held a special fascination for me.</p>
<p>As I grew up, my interest gradually shifted to computers, which at
that time filled large rooms and displayed panels of mysterious lights
turning on and off at great speed. Towards the end of the 1950s, as a
teenager, I wanted to understand how computers worked. I could never
have imagined that ten years later I would create the technology that
would allow us a few years hence to integrate an entire computer on a
small silicon crystal. In fact, I used that technology to design two
years later the world’s first microprocessor (Intel 4004). Those
accomplishments made it possible to reduce the size of computers and
increase their performance to the point of creating the smartphones we
now take everywhere.</p>
<p>Computers and robots are among the most complex systems we can
imagine and build today, and they encompass the basic principles used in
all other machines.</p>
<p>These are by design classical, deterministic machines, in contrast to
living organisms, which are both quantum and classical systems. We will
see later that these organisms are much more sophisticated than
microchips, because they can “host” the consciousness and free will that
make us human. In other words, the widespread opinion today that living
organisms are classical machines based on biology instead of silicon—and
therefore, in principle equivalent to computers—could not be more
wrong.</p>
<h1 id="the-evolution-of-machines">The Evolution of Machines</h1>
<p>Today’s technology was unthinkable fifty-sixty years ago. But
technique alone is not enough, we need a broader vision.</p>
<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini</p>
<p>Before the discovery of electricity, all machines were mechanical and
were based on levers, wheels, pulleys, gears, springs, and so on. For
millennia, the energy source of machines came from wind, water, or
animal muscles. At the end of the seventeenth century, the invention of
the coal-fired steam engine was the spark that ignited the industrial
revolution. About 150 years later a more efficient and compact thermal
engine was devised: the gasoline engine, still widespread today.</p>
<p>The discovery of electromagnetism in the early nineteenth century
brought a new form of energy to the attention of the world, energy
acting without any apparent physical movement. Just think of an
electrical signal that propagates almost at the speed of light within a
telegraph or a telephone cable. Physicists assure us that there are
electrons moving inside that wire, but who has ever seen these
electrons?</p>
<p>With electromagnetism, even matter began to reveal “inner movements”
never observed before, which could be exploited in various ways. For
example, an electric generator could convert mechanical motion into
electricity, and vice versa—a more cost-effective, reversible
transformation than heat engines. And electric cables could carry
electricity from a distant generator into our homes to produce any kind
of work without physically transporting anything.</p>
<p>In 1844 the telegraph was invented to carry information, rather than
energy, by using only one cable and by assigning to each number and
letter of the alphabet a unique binary code represented by a sequence of
electrical impulses of two different durations (Morse code). Thirty-two
years later the telephone was invented by using a continuously variable
electrical signal— called analog signal—to connect people located at
great distances from each other. Soon a dense network of cables covered
the cities, to distribute energy and information without moving anything
but electrical signals. In more recent years, electromagnetic waves—a
form of energy simply unknown 160 years ago—have allowed us to achieve
“wirelessly” most of the tasks that were previously entrusted to
electrical cables.</p>
<p>Today we take for granted the smartphones that we carry everywhere.
They allow us not only to video call anyone in every corner of the
planet, but also to take photographs, videos, and audio recordings, and
finally to compose messages similar to the telegrams of the past, but
now relying on microwaves. We can also store and recall books, photos,
music, and videos, where only 40 years ago we would have used a
different and bulky device for each function. Smartphones also give us
access, inside and outside our homes, to services such as GPS, maps, and
thousands of other applications that were simply unthinkable 40 years
ago.</p>
<p>We are discovering that a large portion of what matters in our life
has to do with information: creating, transforming, moving, and
“consuming” information represent a growing portion of what interests
us. If we think about it, much of the physical movement in the past was
also connected with information. For example, 200 years ago, what we
accomplish with a phone call or by downloading some data to our computer
would have required a trip of several days on horseback. Forty years ago
we physically went to the library, to a record store, or to a movie
theater to do what we now do at home or on the go.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that to transmit information in the past, one
could even lose one’s life, as happened in 490 BC to Philippides, who,
to bring to the Athenians the news of the victory of the Greeks over the
Persians, had to run at breakneck speed for over 40 kilometers, from the
plains of Marathon to Athens. And when he reached his destination, he
managed to pronounce a single word, “Victory,” before collapsing due to
the effort he had made. In this case, the cost of that information was
really very high.</p>
<p>Today, computer technology allows us to create and manipulate
information at such a low cost that, compared to just 50 years ago, our
capacity for obtaining knowledge has increased exponentially.</p>
<h1 id="before-the-information-revolution">Before the Information
Revolution</h1>
<p>The second industrial revolution does not appear as the first with
overwhelming images such as sheet metal presses or steel castings, but
as the bits of a flow of information that runs on the circuits in the
form of electronic pulses. Iron machines are still there, but they obey
weightless bits.</p>
<p>—Italo Calvino, American Lessons</p>
<p>Even before the information revolution there were simple tools for
writing, measuring and calculating: the abacus, for example, has been
around for millennia and is still in use in some developing countries.
All the first computing machines processed information through physical
movement and used rudimentary analog and digital mechanical
contraptions. Even the abacus, which mainly performs a memory function,
requires movements controlled by our fingers.</p>
<p>The first mechanical four-function calculator—the arithmomètre—was
invented by the Frenchman Thomas de Colmar in 1820 and was first
commercialized in 1851. This machine could finally speed up calculations
considerably compared to the abacus—an important difference for a banker
or for an engineer.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, electromechanical calculators had about 1000
moving parts, were manually controlled, and could operate 100 times
faster than a person armed with pen and paper. They were computing
machines in which levers and gears, driven by an electric motor, did all
the work.</p>
<p>Created by Joseph Henry in 1835, the relay was an electrically
activated switch: a hybrid device—electrical and mechanical—in which an
electrical signal could operate a mechanical switch that could connect
or disconnect two electrical wires. A relay allowed a relatively weak
signal to activate a switch that could transfer a much stronger signal
to power many other relays. This allowed an elementary form of signal
processing and amplification, which in turn made possible the creation
of the first automatic telephone switchboards and exchanges, and even
the creation of the first programmable digital computer—the Z3—conceived
and built in 1941 in Germany by Konrad Zuse.1</p>
<p>Henry’s relay was the bridge that allowed the transition from
mechanical to electromechanical processing and from special purpose to
general purpose. However, a relay computer was so slow that it was
almost useless. The task of speeding up the calculations fell to
electronics.</p>
<p>Electronics was born with the invention of the triode, a vacuum tube
conceived by Lee De Forest in 1906. It was a device that modulated the
current flowing between two electrodes—called cathode and anode—by
applying a small voltage to a third electrode called a grid, placed
between the two. The electrodes were located inside a glass tube in
which a vacuum had been created. The triode was the bulky forerunner of
the MOS transistor, in which the current between two electrodes—called
the source and the drain —is modulated by the voltage applied to a third
electrode called a gate.</p>
<p>Invented in 1959, MOS transistors are solid-state devices used in
almost every chip manufactured today. Thanks to the amazing advances in
semiconductors, the space occupied by a single triode of 1906 could
today contain an entire computer system made of more than ten trillion
MOS transistors
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>13</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(10^{13})</annotation></semantics></math>
, including all their interconnections! It is interesting to note that
the volume occupied by the interconnections far exceeds the volume
occupied by the transistors, just like we find in our brains with
neurons and their interconnections.</p>
<p>Today, a single microchip may contain up to one trillion transistors
(a flash memory chip), and can speed up human calculations nearly a
quadrillion times, with nothing moving. Moreover, a chip is “monolithic”
in the sense that all its parts are made and assembled simultaneously.
What moves in a chip are “electrical signals,” but that motion is more
like the propagation of light than the motion of objects. In a chip, the
electromagnetic energy that carries the information flows through a
labyrinth of “streets” and “doors” at close to the speed of light,
following paths established by a program, thus transforming the
information according to human desires.</p>
<h1 id="computers-are-universal-machines">Computers Are Universal
Machines</h1>
<p>Almost all information-processing systems prior to computers were
special purpose, i.e., they could perform only a small set of specific
functions defined by the designer before the machine was built.
Computers, on the other hand, are general purpose, because the same
machine can perform an almost infinite number of different functions,
which often exceed the wildest imagination of the computer hardware
designer!</p>
<p>This prodigious result is due to the separation of the physical
machine from the program, the hardware from the software. The software
is the nonphysical part of the computer, which specifies its function.
What is surprising is that the same relatively simple organization of
matter, the hardware, can perform an infinity of algorithms, as long as
it has sufficient memory and speed.</p>
<p>It was Alan Turing, in 1936, who conceived such a “universal machine”
with a thought experiment aimed at demonstrating that the so-called
decision problem posed by the mathematician David Hilbert in
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>1928</mn><mn>2</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1928^{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
was unsolvable. The Turing machine gave us an abstract model of a class
of universal machines capable of executing any general algorithm. And
this invention created theoretical information science and showed the
deep and stimulating links between mathematics, information, and
intelligence.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that with computers, the hardware cannot do
anything without software. Software refers to a collection of programs,
and a program is a sequence of commands that the hardware will
mechanically execute down to the smallest detail. The computer
vocabulary, called the instruction set, is the ensemble of instructions.
Each instruction defines a deterministic transformation to be performed
on the data. And here another important distinction emerges: information
can take two basic forms, namely data and instructions, both stored in
the memory in binary form. The data is the “raw material” which can be
shaped into any form by the instructions. It should be emphasized that
instructions and data mean nothing to the computer, which is not
conscious. Only the human consciousness can understand what the computer
does.</p>
<p>The computer hardware is physical, reductive, and deterministic, just
like the software, though the latter is not strictly physical. The
computer represents the first step in a process in which the human mind
has learned to control inanimate matter by making it act in the desired
way. The invention and perfecting of the computer represents a decisive
step in human evolution. It also marks a delicate transition for
humanity, as we will discuss in the course of the book.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-computers">The Nature of Computers</h1>
<p>A program is devised by a human mind and written in “Boolean,” a
language that can be executed by a machine at a speed close to that of
light, the same speed at which signals travel inside microchips. That
speed is millions of times faster than what is achievable by macroscopic
mechanical structures. The Boolean language uses an alphabet of only two
letters,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
and “1,” and is therefore binary, i.e., made up of bits. Each word in
this language is thus a sequence made up of a finite number of bits.</p>
<p>The bit represents the smallest amount of information possible, i.e.,
the amount necessary to make a single distinction:
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
or “1,” this or that, exists or does not exist, true or false, and so
on. It is an extremely effective language, because the hardware only has
to recognize two possible states.</p>
<p>The part of the hardware that carries out the program instructions is
called the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU also controls the flow
of input and output (I/O) data with which the computer communicates with
the outside world. The memory is like a matrix of cells, each containing
a “binary word” with a predetermined number of bits, typically ranging
from 8 to 64 bits in multiples of 8. CPU, memory, and I/O represent the
three basic building blocks of a computer.</p>
<p>Note that the only recognition required of the hardware is to
reliably distinguish the state
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
from the state “1.” This recognition does not produce any meaning, but
it must be absolutely correct because even a single mistake could lead
to a malfunction. The meanings of the two states are known only to the
programmer, not to the computer. The bit is typically represented by two
ranges of values in the voltage of an electrical signal.</p>
<p>The state of each bit in memory can be simply read or written as
desired. These bits are generally organized into words that the CPU
reads or writes in parallel. The longer the word, the faster the
computer, because accessing the external memory takes much longer than
accessing the data that is stored inside the CPU.3</p>
<p>To access each word in memory, the program must provide the address,
i.e., the “coordinates” corresponding to the row and the column numbers
that identify the cell in the memory matrix. Each instruction also
prescribes what operation to perform and where to find the data, and the
next instruction.</p>
<p>The programmer is the creator of the program, while the hardware is
the blind executor of the program. The program is expressed by the
specific configuration of the states in a “field of possible states,”
which is the computer memory. It should be noted that the field of
states can be understood as the interface between mind and matter. Here
we have, for the first time, a machine that interfaces with what goes
beyond physics. I say “beyond” because the meaning of both the program
and the result of the processing does not reside within the computer.
The field of states that contains the program and the data has been
arranged by the human mind; the computer acts on itself and on the
external environment through the unconscious and stereotyped actions of
the CPU controlled by the program.</p>
<p>A computer is a physical structure in which an energy pattern created
by the human mind has been organized in such a form that matter is
forced to act in accordance with this pattern. Inside a computer, the
subjective intentions and meaning of the programmer have been completely
objectified in the program. The result of the mechanical processing
performed by the computer is finally returned to the environment and/or
to the human mind to be subjectively interpreted. In this way, human
beings can simulate the consequences of their thoughts and fantasies
with extreme precision.</p>
<p>The operation of the computer, however, is extremely fragile, because
it would take just one wrong bit to turn a machine that seems
intelligent and deliberate into a completely useless box of metal,
plastic, and silicon. Thus, without constant human supervision,
computers could easily fail due to a trivial hardware problem or a
software bug.</p>
<p>Within a deterministic machine there is no free will, although a
decision independent of the program could be caused either by an
“interrupt”4 coming from the environment or from the program itself
asking the outside world to provide some input data. In such a case,
non-algorithmic decisions may arise from the free will of human beings
or from truly random quantum events. These interventions coming from the
environment allow the computer to go beyond the limits of algorithms,
though originating outside the computer. Meaning, understanding, and
free-will decisions do not exist within a computer. Moreover, the
randomness of quantum physics is fundamentally different from what we
call random in classical systems. Classical randomness corresponds to
the lack of knowledge of what could be known by solving the
deterministic equations of classical physics; quantum randomness is
instead non-algorithmic because it is indetermined prior to the
measurement that literally creates it.</p>
<p>For example, the exact position of an artificial satellite at a
specific time two days from now can be known in a few minutes because it
can be calculated with extreme precision by a fast computer. The value
of the spin of an electron (“up” or “down”) two seconds from now,
however, cannot be known before the measurement because there is no law
or algorithm that can determine it. In other words, the randomness of
quantum physics does not correspond to the ignorance of a reality that
is knowable, but to a reality that has not yet been created, and
therefore is unknowable in principle.</p>
<p>When a computer has access to quantum information “from the outside,”
it ceases to be completely deterministic. We will begin to explore these
situations starting from the last chapter of Part One.</p>
<h1 id="computers-are-reductionistic">Computers Are Reductionistic</h1>
<p>A typical machine is a deterministic and reductionist system entirely
built with separable parts that can be disassembled and then reassembled
to fully restore its operation. Physical removability of parts can be
replaced by the concept of parts “separable in principle” (SIP) because
it may be impractical to build machines made entirely with removable
parts. This is the case with today’s computers, for example, which are
monolithic microchips.</p>
<p>A microchip may contain many billions of transistors all
interconnected. Each transistor is electrically isolated from all the
others and functions only as an on-off switch. Thus, each transistor is
SIP because we can imagine removing it completely and ideally replacing
it with an identical transistor without affecting the operation of the
system. Transistors are built by exploiting the quantum properties of
crystals, which allow better characteristics than those achievable by
using classical properties of matter. The smallest “parts” that make up
a transistor are collections of many thousands of atoms and molecules in
crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous form.</p>
<p>Note that, once the computer is built, its physical matter always
remains the same, unlike living cells in which matter continually enters
and exits the cell to feed, eliminate, and reproduce by creating a copy
of itself within itself.</p>
<p>A computer is made with a very large but finite number of SIP parts,
and each of them, although autonomous and independent, interacts in a
welldefined way with the others. To perform a useful function, each part
must interact with at least another part, otherwise it would be
superfluous. Every interaction requires necessarily an exchange of
energy between the parts and the surrounding environment. Therefore, no
part can be strictly considered a closed thermodynamic system. Finally,
each part has an identifiable boundary beyond which its function ceases.
However, dissipative exchanges with the environment cannot be completely
eliminated. They are an irreducible consequence of the holistic nature
of physical reality, a clear demonstration that a reductionistic system
is an idealization of a holistic system.</p>
<p>A reductionistic system is, therefore, a holistic system in which the
inevitable dissipative interactions with the environment have been
minimized to avoid jeopardizing their intended function. Such a system
is a simplified mental model of reality, a theory valid only within a
range of environmental conditions in which the dissipative effects do
not alter the function of the system. When we consider that the
elementary parts of which everything is made are quantum states that
behave like probability waves that can also be influenced by the random
fluctuations of the quantum vacuum (see Glossary), true reductionism
cannot exist.</p>
<p>Classical physics is therefore a theory valid only within the ranges
of environmental conditions in which quantum and other effects do not
affect the deterministic nature of the theory. However, since quantum
effects can never be completely eliminated, any attempt to fully
describe reality classically may produce erroneous predictions.</p>
<p>Many forget that a theory of reality is not reality. As Heisenberg
states: “Physics is not a representation of reality, but of our way of
thinking about it.” This forgetfulness often leads to a denial of those
phenomena that the theory cannot explain. For example, the idea that a
human body is a classical machine is falsified by the existence of
consciousness and free will which cannot emerge from a classical
reductionist and deterministic system. This crucial topic will be
discussed in depth later.</p>
<h1 id="computers-are-deterministic">Computers Are Deterministic</h1>
<p>Like reductionism, determinism is also a theory. It is an
idealization of the world, an approximate description based on a
mathematical theory invented by us. Determinism cannot necessarily
describe all aspects of the world, and therefore, sooner or later, some
quantum phenomenon will falsify it. Our machines are designed to
reliably perform specific functions. They are deterministic because we
want them this way. If they were unpredictable, they would not be
useful. They are in fact advantageous precisely because they never tire
of repeating the same stereotyped behavior, contrary to human beings who
can easily get bored and distracted, and therefore make mistakes.</p>
<p>A computer program is rigidly deterministic even when we wish it
weren’t. For example, an algorithm for generating snowflake images can
contain a set of parameters with which to create an almost infinite
variety of them. However, these parameters must be either generated by
another algorithm or inserted from the outside when the program asks for
them. Nondeterministic behavior may then derive from random information
originating from a quantum system that is not part of the program. The
conclusion is that a computer that operates entirely on its own program
and without any external input of data is completely deterministic and
predictable, as long as one knows all the details of the program and how
the computer works. This last requirement can always be satisfied
because the bits of the computer can be copied. In other words, the
internal state of the computer is objective and can be known and shared
by many observers. Note that the same requirement is not satisfied by
quantum systems, because the state of a qubit cannot be copied, and
cannot be measured without disturbing it and therefore changing it
unpredictably.</p>
<p>The qubit can be represented by the direction of the magnetic moment
of a particle (spin) or by another quantum phenomenon with similar
characteristics. The spin can be oriented anywhere in a complex
twodimensional Hilbert space (see Glossary). Therefore, the qubit can
have an infinity of possible directions (states) that can be represented
by all the points on the surface of a sphere of radius 1. To measure the
spin, the particle must pass through a non-uniform magnetic field with
an arbitrary direction with respect to the orientation of the spin. When
measuring the spin, it will always be found to be aligned either with
the direction of the magnetic field of the instrument or in the opposite
direction. The infinity of states of a qubit is therefore reduced to one
bit of classical information when the spin is measured.</p>
<p>Classical physics is deterministic, while quantum physics is both
indeterministic and deterministic. This is a subtle but crucial point,
because quantum physics is a probabilistic theory that can only predict
the probabilities of events. However, when it predicts that the
probability of a given event is 1 or 0, it is deterministic, while when
it predicts probabilities other than 1 or 0 it is indeterministic. To be
falsifiable, a theory must predict some events that always happen and
others that never happen, because then a single experiment can falsify
the theory. Quantum physics satisfies this crucial criterion of
falsifiability, because it predicts some events with probability 1 or 0
that can then be falsified.6</p>
<p>Classical physics is a theory in which variables can assume a
continuum of values expressed by real numbers. Computers, however, have
finite accuracy, and this difference has important implications. For
example, two identical computers running the same software will produce
exactly the same results, even if they simulate a chaotic system whose
behavior depends critically on the initial conditions. But two identical
real chaotic physical systems will never behave in the same way, because
it is impossible to set their initial conditions with sufficient
precision. Therefore, after some time, their behaviors will gradually
move away from each other and will end up being completely different.
Hence the simulation of a chaotic system, after a period of time, may
not correspond to the real physical system because the initial
conditions of the real system may not be the same as those of a
simulation with finite precision.</p>
<p>This analysis highlights a fundamental difference between the
determinism of a computer and that of classical physics, which is
deterministic but not necessarily predictable, because it is described
with real numbers and not with finite precision numbers. Therefore, even
if the theory were
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100\%</annotation></semantics></math>
correct, the simulation of the theory of a chaotic system might not
match the real system. Consequently, computers represent a subset of
classical physics, in which the accuracy of the calculation is finite.
In turn, classical physics is a special case of quantum physics applied
to macroscopic systems in which quantum properties are averaged out.
Therefore, its predictions are, at best, deterministic approximations of
the probabilistic description of reality made by quantum physics.</p>
<p>The idea that reality is deterministic has already been disproved by
quantum physics, but it is still supported by many who believe that
objects on our scale are adequately described by classical physics,
while this is not the case, especially for complex systems which are
generally chaotic. Just think of the weather forecast or the behavior of
living beings. Determinism is another idealization of reality valid only
in the computer world. It is a good approximation for many classical
systems, much less for macroscopic quantum-and-classical systems such as
living organisms.</p>
<h1 id="computers-can-be-unpredictable">Computers Can Be
Unpredictable</h1>
<p>With the advent of robotics and artificial intelligence based on
neural networks, computers increasingly operate with data from the real
world, which may also include information produced by quantum events and
human decisions. This leads the computer to operate outside the limits
of a classical deterministic system. Such a situation presents
challenges and opportunities that are not fully understood, not even by
professionals.</p>
<p>Complex patterns such as faces, words, or urban traffic situations,
have astounding variability, to the point where the recognition rate
cannot be perfect, especially under unfavorable environmental
conditions. Therefore, the performance of a robot or computer cannot be
guaranteed, unlike in situations where the computer runs a deterministic
algorithm. With artificial neural networks,7 the unpredictability of the
real world is brought into the computer, especially if the neural
networks determine key parameters of the program. Thus, if a computer
were allowed to make important decisions based on the presumed validity
of its pattern recognition, the consequences could be catastrophic. This
is a serious problem, since computers have no understanding of the
situations in which they operate. Ethical choices, for example, cannot
be decided by an algorithm!</p>
<p>Can we trust a robot if its behavior can be unpredictable? If a robot
operates entirely on a factory floor in which it repeats the same
stereotyped series of operations in a controlled environment, the answer
is yes. However, even in this case, if a fault or an unforeseen event
should occur, human intervention might still be necessary. If we wish to
build a self-driving car, the situation changes completely, given the
vast number of imponderable variables that increase dramatically as we
go from driving in a controlledaccess freeway to driving in the center
of a large city like New York or</p>
<p>Rome. If we also add the possibility of deliberate deception to the
mix, i.e., hostile agents that could purposely create situations aimed
at confusing the system, the performance could become unacceptable. The
increase of cybercrime, even without the ambiguities of artificial
intelligence, is a preview of what could happen. Cybercrime should be a
warning about the dangers and unpredictability associated with giving
robots autonomy.</p>
<p>There is an unbridgeable gap between artificial and human
intelligence, which is characterized by comprehension: a non-algorithmic
property of consciousness that is often underestimated and inaccessible
to computers, as we will see in the course of this book. In my opinion,
self-driving vehicles will eventually become possible, but long after
the optimistic forecasts we all have heard. The economic and social
benefits of self-driving are too great to abandon development, despite
the great difficulties that will be encountered. Moreover, since traffic
accidents are almost always caused by drunk, inattentive, or careless
drivers, the reliability of a robot that doesn’t drink, follows the
rules, and never gets tired, may produce an average benefit that may
eventually be favorable.</p>
<p>So far I have made no distinction between computers and robots, as if
they had the same level of complexity, but this is not true. Robots have
the additional ability to perceive the world through sensors, act in the
world, and monitor their own performance against internal standards
established by the programmers. They may also modify their own processes
to some extent, but this area is questionable, for, if we allowed them
to significantly change their own programs without supervision, they
might no longer be predictable and their dependability might greatly
suffer.</p>
<p>The complexity of a robot that learns on its own is many orders of
magnitude greater than that of ordinary robots. I expect that, thanks to
the development of self-driving vehicles, we will learn a lot more about
autonomous robots. I also expect that this knowledge will improve the
efficiency of human learning. As Professor of Cognitive Sciences
Margaret Boden says: “The most important lesson that AI has taught us is
to appreciate and recognize for the first time the enormous power and
subtlety of the human mind.” Robots have properties that are
complementary to those of humans. It is up to us to use them wisely to
improve our condition and that of the ecosystem.</p>
<h1 id="robots-versus-living-organisms">Robots versus Living
Organisms</h1>
<p>Computers are magnificent tools for making our dreams come true, but
no machine can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and
understanding.</p>
<p>—Lou Gerstner</p>
<p>The fundamental differences between robots and living organisms are
surprising and poorly understood. While computers and robots are
classical machines, living organisms are not because they process
information using all the phenomena available in the physical world:
quantum, classical, discrete, and continuous.</p>
<p>Inside a living cell, individual atoms are used to process
information, and this makes it extremely difficult to understand how the
cell works. The quantum behavior of single atomic and molecular events
within a living cell gives rise to an incredibly complex dynamic order,
which cannot be described by the quantum statistical laws that regulate
the behavior of objects made up of millions of atoms. A cell is much
more sophisticated than a mixture of atoms and organic molecules that
freely interact inside a droplet of water. Its dynamic order must be
orchestrated from the whole to the parts, and vice versa, in clever and
still unknown ways.</p>
<p>We know that changing a single bit in the wrong place of a computer
program can make a fundamental difference. The same also applies to a
cell, since the presence or absence of a single proton (hydrogen ion) at
the wrong place and time may have serious consequences. This fact
underlies another fundamental difference between a cell and a computer,
because, while a bit is only abstract information, a proton or an atom
is also matter and energy, which can be used to build more complex
molecules in addition to performing informational tasks.</p>
<p>A living cell is not a purely reductionist machine. Instead, it is a
quantum-classical dynamical system closer to the quantum reality than to
the classical one. For example, if we could take apart all the atoms and
molecules that make up a cell, could we then reassemble them and
recreate the same living cell? Nobody knows how to do this, for it would
be necessary to know the state of every atom and molecule, including the
molecules of the water. Such properties would have to be measured while
the cell is alive, in which case the system would be disturbed in
unpredictable ways. Moreover, since the cell is incredibly dynamic, it
is different at every instant, making it impossible to simultaneously
measure its state. In a nutshell, there is no way to reconstruct a cell.
As physicist Richard Feynman says: “What I cannot build, I cannot
understand.” We can build a computer starting from its elementary
components, but no one has ever been able to build a cell starting from
its atoms.</p>
<p>Another interesting difference is that, in order to function, a
machine must first be built in its entirety, and only then can it be
switched on and off at will. Surprisingly, any living organism is built
alive and it will only shut down once, when it dies, that is, when an
irreversible change occurs that can no longer be self-repaired. To live,
a multicellular organism must have a critical mass of live cells, to
which new ones are added as the old ones die. When the death of the
entire organism occurs, it can no longer be rekindled. When a
multicellular organism self-assembles, every new cell that is added is
alive, so that the organism is also built alive and is never turned
on.</p>
<p>Another important aspect that has a precise meaning for a machine,
but not for a living organism, is expressed in the concept of
“completion.” When a machine leaves the factory it is completed, and,
once finished, it remains essentially the same. Living organisms, on the
other hand, change, transform, and evolve continuously. They are never
finished, because they are always in a state of becoming. For example,
an unfertilized human egg (gamete) is alive for some time, and
immediately after fertilization it transforms itself into a fetus, a
child, an adolescent, an adult, and so on, with an unbelievable
dynamism. A living organism is never the same physical and psychological
entity from one instant to the next. The computer hardware, on the other
hand, remains the same physical structure from the moment it leaves the
factory until it stops working or it is discarded.</p>
<p>The dynamism of a living organism is irreducible, whether it
manifests itself as a bacterium or as a human being. Life is like a
flame that produces other flames by dividing itself. This is why, to
create a new life, one must always start with life. As summed up by the
seventeenth-century biologist Francesco Redi: “Omne vivum ex vivo,”
i.e., everything that is alive derives from something alive. The only
way to start a new life is always to begin with another life. After the
first cell, all living organisms were formed “alive” within another
organism.</p>
<p>So how did the first cell come about?</p>
<p>This question is similar to “How was the universe created?” Nobody
has the answer. Indeed, the more we know about cells and the universe,
the less we can explain about their origin.8 To use Margherita Hack’s
words in
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M y</annotation></semantics></math>
Infinity: “Certainly, the greatest and most extraordinary enigma, even
more than the universe, is our mind, of which we still know very little,
much less than what it has understood of the universe.”</p>
<p>5 This notion is necessary because it may be impossible to physically
remove a part without destroying it or the rest of the system. For
example, a microchip is built entirely with nonremovable parts, because
the transistors must be as small as possible to increase their speed and
reduce their power dissipation and cost. Whenever we could in principle
remove a part without affecting the functionality of all the other
parts, then that part is SIP.<br />
6 I owe this clear distinction to Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano, professor of
theoretical physics at the University of Pavia.<br />
7 Artificial neural networks are programs that mimic some of the
important functions performed by the biological neural networks of our
brain. These networks automatically learn the correlations present in
the data used to train them. Networks thus learn to recognize complex
patterns (patterns of patterns of patterns). When a network correctly
recognizes patterns never seen before, i.e., patterns that were not part
of the training set, the network is able to generalize. The simulation
of neural networks with specialized hardware is responsible for the
recent major advances in AI and robotics.<br />

atoms that function dynamically in an exquisite way. How did those atoms
and molecules self-assemble as a result of natural processes? Beyond
simple organic molecules, and despite our considerable scientific
knowledge, no one has ever been able to figure out how this feat
happened.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-information-1">The Nature of Information</h1>
<p>Information is a conceptual labyrinth. —Luciano Floridi, The
Information Revolution</p>
<p>When we were kids, information was also part of our games. I remember
how we enjoyed exchanging our secrets with the “silent alphabet,” which
allowed us not to be heard by adults.</p>
<p>As for the “wireless phone,” it was very amusing to discover how the
sentence that the first player whispered in the ear of the second was
completely unrecognizable by the time it reached the end of the
line.</p>
<p>But information is not a game, it is very serious business, so much
so that this period of rapid technological and social change has been
properly called the “information revolution.”</p>
<p>Begun in the mid-twentieth century, thanks to the development of
digital technologies, information is having a gigantic impact on
society, greater than that of the industrial revolution. “Microchip,”
“information processing,” and “the web” are now part of our vocabulary,
just as “engine,” “production line,” and “industry” were the new words
that characterized the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>But what is information? What explains the exponential growth of the
information technologies that we are witnessing? What is it that makes
information so transformative that we can develop artificial
intelligence, robots, and self-driving cars?</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-information">A Brief History of
Information</h1>
<p>Information began with gestures, guttural sounds, the birth of words
and languages, simple pictorial and graphic signs, the brush, cuneiform
writing, alphabets, abacus, papyrus, pen, ink, paper, book, and the
printing press. Then information took an epochal turning point with the
invention of the telegraph and the telephone, which exploited the
discovery of electricity. Decades later, the discovery of
electromagnetic waves made possible wireless long-distance
communications and previously unimaginable radio and TV
transmissions.</p>
<p>The need to amplify weak radio signals led to the invention of the
vacuum tube, giving life to the field of electronics. Vacuum tubes could
for the first time manipulate high-frequency electrical signals, and
were soon used in many other applications not originally intended, such
as radar, microwave transmission, electronic controls, and
television.</p>
<p>The desire to accelerate the speed of electromechanical calculators
and to automatically compute arbitrary sequences of arithmetic
operations led to the invention of the programmable computer.</p>
<p>The first modern electronic digital computer with a stored program
was the EDSAC, built in 1949 at the University of Cambridge, England. It
implemented John von Neumann’s idea of storing programs and data in the
same memory, while in previous computers, such as the famous ENIAC, the
program consisted of panels with switches and plugs that had to be
manually operated through a long and laborious process.</p>
<p>All early computers were research machines designed to perform
numerical calculations, and each one was the only specimen ever
built.</p>
<p>The first commercial electronic computer for general use, the UNIVAC
I, was introduced in 1951, exactly 100 years after the start of
production of the arithmomètre, described in the previous chapter.
UNIVAC I was a storedprogram computer suitable for various applications,
such as the sorting and analysis of financial and administrative data.
It had a 1024-word, 12-bit serial main memory and for the first time it
used magnetic tape as a secondary memory to increase the overall memory.
This machine used 5200 vacuum tubes that dissipated
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>125</mn><mspace width="0.222em"></mspace><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">k</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">W</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">125~\mathrm{kW}</annotation></semantics></math>
and could perform 500 multiplications per second. Forty-six units were
sold, at a cost of over one million dollars each, demonstrating for the
first time the existence of a market for computers.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, the first microprocessor in the world was born,
the Intel 4004, a 4-bit CPU which I designed in 1970–71. Three years
later, a computer with performance comparable to the UNIVAC I could be
made in a
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>30</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>30</mn><mspace width="0.222em"></mspace><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">30\times30~\mathrm{cm}^{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
printed circuit board using the world’s first high-performance 8- bit
microprocessor (Intel 8080). Such a computer dissipated 10 W and cost a
few hundred dollars. After another ten years, with smaller and faster
transistors, the same computer could be integrated into a single chip
with more than ten times the speed of UNIVAC I, consuming less than 1
watt, and costing about ten dollars. This was the miracle of
semiconductor-based microelectronics, the technology that reduced a
computer the size of an apartment to the smartphone we carry in our
pockets, powered only by a rechargeable battery.</p>
<p>Microelectronics began with germanium transistors, invented in 1947,
followed by diffusion bipolar transistors which, starting in 1953,
gradually replaced vacuum tubes. Ten years later we had the first
bipolar monolithic integrated circuits with a dozen transistors, and by
the mid-1970s an entire computer could be integrated into a single chip
using silicon gate MOS transistors. This integration level was made
possible by the silicon gate technology that I co-invented in 1968 at
Fairchild Semiconductor [3]. Twenty years later, almost all integrated
circuits produced in the world were made with silicon gate, away from
bipolar technology that in 1968 accounted for nearly all integrated
circuits.</p>
<p>With silicon gate the part became the whole, because the tens of
thousands of transistors used to build a computer were replaced by a
piece of silicon smaller than a fingernail.</p>
<p>Semiconductor-based microelectronics gave birth to personal
computers, cellphones, and fast digital communications, followed by the
creation of the internet with services of power and utility unimaginable
by even the most daring science fiction writers. Smartphones, which
today are owned by about two billion people, sum up in pocket size much
of the information technology (IT) and telematic progress made in the
last 50 years.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic could have destroyed the world’s economies,
were it not for the availability of essentially free internet
videoconferencing and other services that allowed most businesses,
schools, and other enterprises to continue operating even with people
confined at home.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-information">What Is Information?</h1>
<p>The word “information” comes from the Latin in-forma, that is, to
give shape to something. It is one of those words, like “time” or
“energy,” whose meaning we think we know until we are asked to define
them precisely. The fact is that the term “information” has many
meanings, which vary according to the context in which it is used. It
can indicate data, facts, news, instructions, knowledge, intelligence,
relevance, meaning, what is represented by a particular arrangement of
signs or symbols, the amount of information carried by a particular
symbol, and so on.</p>
<p>Information remains one of the concepts that are perplexing even to
those who work in the field. According to the French mathematician René
Thom in his From Morphogenesis to Structure, “the term ‘information,’
too full of all its intentional and anthropocentric connotations, should
be banned from science.” Yet information, which we do not yet know how
to properly define, can be processed and transformed by a computer.</p>
<p>The central concept of information has to do with a particular
relationship between an “observer” and an “event” that transmits
“information” to the observer. The event is a sign that brings with it
information, that is, new knowledge for the observer.</p>
<p>Note that, if the observer knew in advance which event would occur,
the event would bring no new information, but only confirmation of what
he already knew. If, on the other hand, the event increased his
knowledge, it would have transmitted information. Therefore, the
information transferred by an event, a sign, or a signal is related to
the state of knowledge of the observer himself.</p>
<p>Information is not something physical that we can easily measure,
such as the mass of an object. Therefore, it is generally impossible to
speak in absolute terms of the information transmitted by an event,
since it depends not only on the event but also on the observer. In
fact, the same event can carry different meanings to different
observers. Moreover, even for the same observer, the meaning can vary
according to his circumstances.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example: Suppose my brother-in-law meets me on the
street, raising his hand with the thumbs-up sign, and two other people
witness the same event besides me. Person A does not know what the
thumbs-up sign means, so she hasn’t received any objective information,
even though she has seen the sign and may wonder what it means. Person B
knows that the sign means “something good has happened,” therefore he
has received some objective information, but he does not know who and
what that sign is for, therefore he has only received a small amount of
meaning. For me, that sign means that the surgery undergone by my sister
was successful, and I am delighted and relieved. Therefore, I received
the same amount of objective information as B, but also a large amount
of subjective meaning, since my uncertainty was overcome and my
emotional state drastically improved. If the same sign meant that my
brother-in-law had won a ten-dollar bet, its impact on me would have
been significantly less.</p>
<p>This example illustrates the subjective nature of the meaning arising
from objective events, and it also highlights two types of meaning:
objective and subjective. The objective meaning is the formal meaning of
a sign, i.e., the meaning that is conventionally shared by a community,
by agreement. On the other hand, the subjective meaning is the specific
meaning that the sign carries for a particular observer. The transfer of
subjective meaning is conditioned by the perception and recognition of
the conventional (objective) meaning of the sign.</p>
<p>Note that the perception of a sign as something that “could have”
meaning is independent of the knowledge of its objective meaning. This
is the situation for observer A who perceived the sign and understood
that it might mean something, but she didn’t know what it stood for. The
recognition of the objective meaning of a sign can only take place if
the meaning was previously known, thanks to an explicit or implicit
agreement. Therefore, what we call information is always based on a
prior agreement, which questions the universality of what is meant by
“objective.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that even the “absence of an event” can bring
information and meaning. For example, suppose I tell a friend that if he
doesn’t see me in the main square at 6 p.m., he can find me at the
Bellavista bar. In this case I am using my presence or absence in space
and time (main square at
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn><mspace width="0.222em"></mspace><mi>𝔭</mi><mi>.</mi><mi>𝔪</mi><mi>.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6~{\mathfrak{p}}.{\mathfrak{m}}.</annotation></semantics></math>
) as a sign to convey precise information. My presence or absence
corresponds to a “bit” of information, “1” if I am present and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
if I am not, with the previously agreed meaning for each of the two
states. Presence and absence can therefore convey two very different
meanings.</p>
<p>Note that all the other observers present in the main square at 6
p.m. might not know that my absence is information for someone!
Therefore even in empty space there may be a lot of information for
observers who know where and when to look.</p>
<h1 id="shannons-information">Shannon’s Information</h1>
<p>Now suppose we want to examine objective information that is valid
for both machines and human beings. In this case the signs or events
that carry information have agreed meanings, but not all signs convey
the same “amount” of information. For example, a warning sign that
appears infrequently may contain much more information than signs that
occur frequently.</p>
<p>This is what Claude Shannon theorized in 1948 with the publication of
a fundamental paper entitled ‘A Mathematical Theory of Communication’
[12]. In it, Shannon considered the problem of communicating information
with the aim of quantifying it. He extracted only the objective aspects
and built an effective mathematical theory that was fundamental for
optimizing the use of communication channels, reducing errors, improving
the efficiency of codes, and allowing many other improvements.</p>
<p>The concept of “quantity of information” is based on the following
hypothetical problem: Suppose you know that someone, a sender, will send
you a letter of the English alphabet. When it reaches you, how much
information have you received? This depends on the expectation you had
about receiving that letter. If the sender had randomly chosen a card
from a well-mixed deck of 26 cards in which each card corresponds to a
different letter of the alphabet, each letter would have had the same
chance of being chosen. The probability of choosing any letter (symbol)
is therefore equal to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mn>26</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0.0385</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/26=0.0385</annotation></semantics></math>
. On the other hand, if the sender had randomly selected a letter from a
page of English text, the probability of choosing a particular letter
would depend on the frequency with which that letter is used in
English.</p>
<p>The relative frequency1 of the various letters of the English
alphabet varies greatly: from
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>12.702</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">12.702\%</annotation></semantics></math>
for the letter “e,” the most frequent, to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.074</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.074\%</annotation></semantics></math>
for the letter
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>𝚺</mi><mn>𝟔</mn></msup><mi>𝐙</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi>𝚺</mi><mn>9</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{\Sigma^{6}}\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{\Sigma}^{9}</annotation></semantics></math>
the least used. Thus, the letter “e” is 172 times more likely to be
chosen than the letter “z.” Note that if the text was written in
Italian, the distribution of relative frequencies would have been very
different, even if the alphabet is essentially the same. Therefore the
mathematical theory of information must assume that the alphabet of
symbols and their statistics are known, or can be known.</p>
<p>Without these preliminary clarifications, it is impossible to
understand the narrow meaning of the word “information” used in
Shannon’s theory. Note also that knowing the letters and their
probability of appearing is very different from knowing the order in
which these letters are distributed in a sequence. It just means that,
if you count the number of letters of a certain type in a million
letters, all coming from English text, you can expect to find about
127,020 “e” and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>740</mn><msup><mspace width="0.222em"></mspace><mrow><mi>∘</mi><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><mi>z</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">740~^{\circ\circ}z,</annotation></semantics></math>
without knowing their order.</p>
<p>In the case of transmission of information to general recipients,
like in telegraphy or telephony, it is assumed that the transmission of
each letter has been successful when the transmitted signal reaches the
recipient in such a condition as to be recognizable. This is the context
in which we can calculate the “amount of information” carried by a
symbol or sign.</p>
<p>Shannon defined the amount of information,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">I_{s},</annotation></semantics></math>
transmitted by a symbol,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>s</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math>
, as the negative of the logarithm in base 2 of the probability
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_{s}</annotation></semantics></math>
of receiving that symbol, that is:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>−</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
I_{s}=-l o g_{2}p_{s}
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Since the probability is a number between 0 and 1, the amount of
information is a positive number between 0 and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>∞</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math>
. The negative of the logarithm is called a cologarithm and is often
used when computing the logarithm of a value ranging between 0 and 1
because it will give a positive number.</p>
<p>This definition implies that a symbol that has a small probability of
appearing carries with it a large amount of information. At the other
end, if the probability were 1, we would know exactly which symbol would
appear, and if so, the amount of information carried by it would be
0.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that Shannon never defined what information
is, but only the amount of information carried by a symbol under certain
conditions.</p>
<p>The base 2 of the logarithm was chosen so that, if the alphabet were
composed of only two symbols, for example
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
and “1,” with equal probability of appearing, the amount of information
carried by each symbol would be 1 “bit” (since
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>−</mi><msub><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mn>2</mn></msub><mn>0.5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-\log_{2}0.5=1)</annotation></semantics></math>
. This situation occurs when we flip a fair coin in which the two
possible outcomes have the same probability of appearing. Therefore, the
above definition conveniently measures the amount of information in
units of bit. However, we must not confuse the concept of “bit” as “unit
of measure” with the bit used to indicate the value of a digit in a
binary number. The value of a bit in a binary number is only
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
or “1,” while the amount of information carried by a symbol can be a
real number, such as 2.34 or
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\surd2</annotation></semantics></math>
.</p>
<p>Some scholars explain Shannon’s concept of quantity of information by
saying that it is proportional to the degree of surprise of the
recipient who receives the symbol: the greater the surprise, the greater
the amount of information received. Other people, in a more abstract
way, claim that information is the “resolution of uncertainty,” which
means that the greater the uncertainty existing before transmission, the
greater is the amount of information needed to resolve it. Others like
to describe information as a measure of the “freedom of choice”
available to the person who selects a message.</p>
<p>Note, however, that surprise, uncertainty, and freedom of choice only
make sense to conscious entities and not to machines, for which this
limited concept of information has been defined. A machine has neither
surprises nor uncertainties, not to mention freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Shannon used the term “entropy of information” for the average amount
of information carried by a sequence of symbols. Surprisingly, by
changing the sign of the information entropy formula, we obtain the
formula for the thermodynamic entropy, a fundamental concept in physics.
This strange “coincidence” has brought the concept of information into
physics, where it continues to play an important role. However, it
should be clear that Shannon’s definition of the quantity of information
covers only a small portion of the concept of information we have,
because it excludes a priori the subjective meaning, which is what most
interests us.</p>
<p>Shannon’s information is equivalent to having a machine counting the
symbols that appear, and after collecting their statistics, it tells us
how much “objective” information is contained in each symbol. This is a
perfectly adequate measure of information for a machine that cannot
understand the subjective meaning of symbols, but for us it is totally
inadequate since the notion of information is only useful in connection
with the transmittal of meaning. Without meaning, information is
useless. A machine can only recognize a symbol and act on it based on a
predetermined response decided by its designer.</p>
<p>Shannon’s concept of information requires only the correct detection
and recognition of a sign or symbol belonging to a predetermined
alphabet of symbols. Information is connected only to the objective
meaning of a sign. Note that the widespread use of the word “symbol” in
information theory should imply meaning, leading one to believe that
Shannon’s information is of interest to us, but this is not so. The
words “sign” or “signal” would have been more appropriate, since their
connection with meaning is weaker, although still present. Perhaps
“event” would have been the most appropriate word, because all that is
required of an observer is the perception and recognition of the event
as such. “Information” is then only the cologarithm of the probability
of observing that event.</p>
<p>For a human being, the recognition of an event is often unconscious
(mechanical) and is only a prerequisite for having access to the rich
subjective and conscious meaning we can associate with it.</p>
<p>A crucial observation is that the subjective meaning of a text
depends on the specific order of the letters that form the words that
carry the meaning, not on their probability of appearance. Nonetheless,
this theory has been fundamental in describing some important aspects of
the functioning of communication systems and computers.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-bit">What Is a Bit?</h1>
<p>Almost everyone has heard of bits nowadays, although for many the
concept remains nebulous. “Bit” is the name of an abstract entity that
can only exist in one of two possible states, such as the “heads” or
“tails” of a coin. A bit can then be used to represent the simplest
possible distinction. For example, it can indicate yes or no, true or
false, on or off, left or right, present or absent, or the numbers
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mi>∘</mi><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{\circ\circ}</annotation></semantics></math>
and “1” in a base 2 numeral system. These quasiobjective meanings can be
associated by convention with the two states represented by a bit.</p>
<p>Note that the numbers we commonly use are written using a base 10
numeral system. However, any number could also be written in a base 2
system called a “binary numeral system,” which uses only two states

) of the decimal numeral system.2 It is therefore possible to convert
any number expressed with a base 10 system into a binary number
containing a finite sequence of

,” and vice versa.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many rational numbers that can be written with a finite
number of decimal digits may require an infinite number of binary digits
after the decimal point.</p>
<p>In a computer, the two values of a bit are represented by a
convention that must be strictly respected in all its electronic
circuits. For example, when the voltage in a node of a circuit is
between 0.6 and 1.0 volts, the status of that node corresponds to the
bit value
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mi>∘</mi><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>∘</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{\circ\circ}1^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math>
; when the voltage is between 0.0 and 0.4 volts, the node status is

; and when the voltage is between 0.4 and 0.6 volts, the status is
indetermined and may cause errors. Values in this latter range may occur
due to a temporary electrical disturbance or to a circuit fault, and may
be recognized as
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}1^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>

by another, causing mistakes.</p>
<p>In summary, “bit” is the name of an abstract entity that exists in
two possible recognizable states in a physical support without any
additional meaning. The bit is an idea, a theory, and its physical
representation requires a robust method that ensures the correct
recognition of the two states even in the worst environmental
conditions. This is a crucial agreement that must be strictly respected
by the manufacturers of computer systems.</p>
<p>A naïve observer who had the task of understanding how a microchip
works by measuring what is physically accessible inside, but knew
nothing about binary computer systems, would think that the important
information is represented by dynamic signals that change rapidly.
Instead, the information that matters is represented by stable but
fleeting states during which, by convention, the signals have meaning.
By observing only the dynamic voltages that are constantly changing at
various points in the system, it would be difficult to understand what
is going on, because the logical description is anchored firmly, but
elusively, on an agreement that is not evident to an ordinary
observer.</p>
<p>The bit level is considered the “semantic” level of the computer:
“semantic” is in quotation marks, because it is semantic only for us,
but not for the computer, which knows nothing about signs, symbols, and
meanings. Also, nowhere inside the chip is there a
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mi>∘</mi><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{\circ\circ}</annotation></semantics></math>
or a “1.”</p>
<p>In summary, a bit is the elementary “quantum” of classical
information. It is not a physical object, but it must be robustly
represented by a physical variable. The binary logic of a digital system
allows for precise and repeatable representations, which are much less
sensitive to electrical noise and circuit tolerances created by
environmental and manufacturing variations.</p>
<h1 id="the-information-of-conscious-entities">The Information of
Conscious Entities</h1>
<p>Words are not identical to things. Knowing words relating to facts is
in no way equivalent to the direct and immediate understanding of the
facts themselves.</p>
<p>—Meister Eckhart</p>
<p>Shannon’s information is what counts for unconscious machines, but it
is not what interests us. It is essential to clarify this point, because
the ambiguity of the words used to describe robots and artificial
intelligence (AI) systems tends to eliminate the abyss that separates
human beings from so-called intelligent machines. The information that
matters most to us is not the symbolic but the semantic information, and
here consciousness is indispensable. The objective recognition of a
symbol by a computer which is passed off as understanding by AI
practitioners is only a mechanical function that we also perform
automatically and unconsciously.</p>
<p>Our understanding involves getting the conscious meaning of the
unconsciously recognized symbols, capability that does not exist for a
computer. Using the same words that refer to human conscious
capabilities to describe a machine’s functions that have none of those
properties is therefore a serious and dangerous disservice. The
ambiguity is heightened by the fact that our body acts both as a machine
and as a conscious entity.</p>
<p>When we speak, the symbols we use serve to convey the subjective
meaning we feel, unlike the objective symbols used by machines. For
example, to choose the words necessary to communicate with Luke, I must
first convert my subjective meaning into mental words, and then
verbalize them. In this way I create a sound wave that carries the
meaning conveyed by the language we both know. My sound waves are
perceived by Luke’s auditory system and unconsciously recognized as the
symbols I intended to express. So far, the recognition process is
similar to what machines do. Immediately afterwards, however, Luke
experiences in his consciousness the sound sensation of the recognized
words together with their subjective meaning, which could be somewhat
different from mine.</p>
<p>Philosophers use the term “qualia” for the sensations and feelings we
experience in our consciousness. Qualia refer to what it feels like in
our inner experience after the automatic recognition of a symbol. The
symbols are the carriers of qualia and qualia are the carriers of
meaning. A computer feels nothing and, when a symbol is recognized, that
recognition simply causes another symbol to be instantiated. That is all
that a computer can do. Qualia and meaning are properties of
consciousness not available to computers.</p>
<p>In summary, our recognition of a word as a sign is as automatic as it
is in a robot, but in our consciousness the recognized sign is a symbol
that is converted into sound qualia and their associated meaning. The
latter comes mainly from the emotions and thoughts connected with the
long-term memory of our life experiences. After consciously choosing the
meaning we wish to communicate, our body automatically translates it
into sound waves, through the symbolic processing of the brain. In this
way we transform subjective and private meaning into objective and
public symbols to communicate to others.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the conscious processing of meaning is very
different from the automatic processing of symbols. Although we know
little about it, it seems that the first is mainly based on associative
and analogical operations between qualia, together with the logical and
linear processes of the rational mind performed primarily by the brain.
For example, the reasoning done with pen and paper when we solve a
mathematical problem is a combination of conscious semantic and
unconscious symbolic processes that include the reification of conscious
thoughts into mental and material symbols, automatic procedures,
intuitions, emotions, and intentions, all supervised by our
consciousness.</p>
<p>This processing goes far beyond the symbolic and algorithmic
processing that computers can do and that are describable with Shannon’s
information. This is a crucial distinction that is generally not well
understood because science and technology describe only the symbolic and
mechanical aspect of reality. The processing we perform includes the
meaning that is the important currency of our lived experience.</p>
<p>Even when a computer uses artificial neural networks, its behavior is
still mechanical, and therefore limited, because comprehension and
creativity are properties of consciousness that go beyond what machines
can do. The fact that computers can far surpass human performance in
mechanical processes should not surprise us because we are the ones who
figured out the procedures to use and the ways to speed up their
execution and reliability. In summary, computers are physical structures
to which we have transferred a portion of our mind in the form of
programs, creating a bridge between matter and mind. Our programs reveal
only the symbolic and algorithmic aspect of the mind, because they do
not possess the semantic level and the free will that distinguish us.
Computers are our creations and incorporate only the algorithmic part of
our essence. We are not computers; we are creators of computers.</p>
<p>Consciousness is our true nature, because it is what allows us to
know and comprehend. In the words of the philosopher Michael Polanyi in
Unexpressed Knowledge, we “can know more than we can say.”</p>
<h1 id="the-concept-of-information-extended-1">The Concept of
Information Extended</h1>
<p>How is it that we have so much information, but know so little? —Noam
Chomsky</p>
<p>Not so long ago—but it seems like centuries ago—information was much
more scarce compared to what we can access nowadays. The latest news
would be shouted on the streets by newspaper vendors and then discussed
during meetings and encounters. Personal information, on the other hand,
was instead spread about through gossip. Passing from mouth to mouth,
these bits transformed from a breeze to a hurricane that:</p>
<p>At the end…overflows and bursts<br />
spreads, doubles<br />
And produces an explosion<br />
Like a shot from a cannon.<br />
—Gioachino Rossini, The Barber of Seville</p>
<p>Then, with the advent of radio, TV, internet, and cellphones,
information has multiplied to the point where we are now literally
submerged by it. We have become so accustomed to this constant
bombardment of news that we have ended up addicted, so much so that we
can no longer do without it.</p>
<p>But so much information does not mean greater knowing. When there is
too much information, we are no longer able to assimilate it. So today
this ancient saying is more relevant than ever: “Est modus in rebus” or
“There is a middle ground in things.”</p>
<p>We have seen that the concept of quantity of information theorized by
Shannon requires the existence of an alphabet of symbols whose objective
meaning and probability distribution are known. This applies to
communication systems and computers, but when the information is between
living organisms the situation is very different. And to correctly
comprehend the functioning of a cell, since the organism lives in
symbiosis with the environment, we must also consider its interactions
with it as well.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will introduce the concept of live information, a
new concept suitable for the types of transformations that occur within
cells, where matter, energy, information, and meaning are inseparable. I
am convinced that the study of this new type of information, in which
the semantic aspect cannot be separated from the symbolic aspect and
from matter-energy, will play a fundamental role in the understanding of
life and will lead us to a deeper understanding of the nature of reality
and consciousness.</p>
<p>The essence of life is about experience, and consciousness is what
allows us, through the body, to have a first-person experience of
ourselves and the world.</p>
<h1 id="living-organisms-as-information-processors">Living Organisms as
Information Processors</h1>
<p>We know little about how cells process information, especially at the
level of the entire organism. Currently, we mainly know the function of
coding DNA, which is about
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5\%</annotation></semantics></math>
of the total human DNA and specifies the structure of about 21,000
proteins. The remainder, or
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>98.5</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">98.5\%</annotation></semantics></math>
of it, was until recently called “junk DNA,” because it seemed to
perform no useful function. How is it possible that life has been so
wasteful and unintelligent as to maintain such a cumbersome and useless
legacy in every cell?</p>
<p>Fortunately, some scientists did not let themselves be fooled by this
prejudice; they understood that it was only an expression of our
ignorance, and today they are discovering authentic jewels in the
“garbage.” I think that within cells there must be levels of global
information processing that are currently unknown and use both classical
and quantum properties deeply connected with the non-coding DNA. An
example of a jewel is the recent discovery of CRISPR-Cas9, a tiny
fragment of non-coding DNA that is revolutionizing genetic engineering,
because it allows us for the first time to modify the DNA of eukaryotic
cells. I would also like to point out that viruses are nothing more than
versions of fundamental mechanisms without which life could not
exist.</p>
<p>A cell is a dynamic system in which matter, information, and energy
are continuously exchanged with the environment so that it is never
physically the same. The fact that each cell contains the genome of the
whole organism tells us that in life the design of the whole is
contained in each of its parts. This is a holographic principle of
profound significance. If a computer were also holographic, each of its
transistors should contain all the essential information that defines
the entire computer, including its software!</p>
<p>Clearly, life is fundamentally different than computers!</p>
<p>Computers are built with transistors—simple on-off switches—each
permanently interconnected with only a few other transistors to form
logic gates. Each logic gate calculates a deterministic binary function
of its input signals that then appears in its output signal. The output
is then sent to the inputs of one or more logic gates. The entire
physical structure of the computer is static; it does not change. The
algorithms that we create and load into the computer memory reflect
instead small portions of the operational part of our mind, but they are
far from containing the complete expression of what and who we are.</p>
<p>In a cell, any electron, ion, atom, or molecule is not only the
carrier of a particular type of information or energy, but is also the
quantum hardware with which each cell is built. Within a cell there is
not a distinct boundary between hardware and software, therefore we
cannot expect living organisms to use the same type of information
processing as our computers. I think that at the interface between the
quantum and the classical behaviors of matter there are many other
computational principles that we do not yet know.</p>
<p>Quantum “objects” have no boundaries and are not separable, unlike
classical particles and computer bits. Individual ions, atoms, and
molecules “move” within the cytoplasm under the influence of local
electromagnetic fields, and their interactions are mainly regulated by
quantum physics. This allows the local environment, which includes the
fluctuations of the quantum vacuum, to manipulate the probabilities to
favor the necessary transformations in each particular region of the
cell. This rich structure can explain, for example, why the photon
capture in chloroplasts reaches the incredible energy efficiency of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>98</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">98\%</annotation></semantics></math>
[4].</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that the physical movement of atoms and
molecules that underlie the physical construction and dismantling of the
biochemical components of a cell represents the slowest form of
information processing. Inside the cell, we can imagine other much
faster and more powerful forms of information processing about which we
currently know almost nothing. For example, methods using electron and
nuclear spins, sound waves (phonons) and electromagnetic waves (photons)
propagating in the cytoplasm.1 Thus, the mechanical movements we observe
in a cell could be the end result of an invisible information processing
that is global, much faster, and much more sophisticated than the
biochemistry we currently study.</p>
<p>Each type of atom or molecule carries specific information and
properties when it interacts with other atoms and molecules. However,
atoms are not like the mechanical levers and gears of classical
machines, because they are quantum systems, and therefore it is
currently difficult to imagine the type of interactions and information
processing they perform. Among other phenomena, we must consider the
existence of quantum interferences that are certainly present inside
every cell.</p>
<p>In living organisms, matter, energy, and information flow from the
environment to the organism, and vice versa. Since the organism lives in
symbiosis with the environment, the two systems must be studied
together. A cell is essentially an open quantum-classical system far
from thermal equilibrium that not only processes information but also
concurrently transforms matter and energy, and here the distinctions
between matter, energy, and information are blurred. Based on the above
considerations, the nature of information processing in living organisms
cannot be the same one we use for our communication systems and
computers where hardware, software, and power supply are neatly
separated, and the hardware does not change every instant.</p>
<h1 id="the-wonderful-organization-of-a-cell">The Wonderful Organization
of a Cell</h1>
<p>In all things of nature there is something wonderful. —Aristotle, De
partibus animalium</p>
<p>It is surprising to observe the complexity of the structure of
certain proteins that should perform rather simple functions, such as
those that are incorporated in the cell membrane and control the passage
of sodium ions
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo></msup><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)</annotation></semantics></math>
from the outer environment to inside the cell. Why do they have such a
complicated structure if they implement such a simple function? I think
it is likely that what seems excessive complexity serves to carry out
important communication and control functions necessary for the global
coordination of the cell. This is the same kind of function I am also
hypothesizing for the “junk DNA.” Unfortunately, while we have
considerable knowledge of local processes, we know almost nothing about
the global functioning of a cell as an autonomous unit.</p>
<p>I imagine that the biochemical level described by molecular
biologists is the equivalent of the electromechanical movements of a
robot that represent the visible and slow aspects of its behavior. These
outward movements are in turn controlled by the microchips, the “brain”
of the robot, whose complex and fast operation is invisible from the
outside. I therefore expect that within a cell there are many extremely
complex computational processes that control it as a whole, of which we
are currently unaware.</p>
<p>It should also be stressed that the clear separation (reductionism)
between software (information), power supply (energy), and hardware
(physical support) that applies to a computer does not exist in a cell.
Consider for example a glucose molecule: its presence within the
hierarchical organization of a cell can be mainly information for a
certain level of the organization, energy for another, and building
material for yet another level.</p>
<p>Moreover, a living cell does not limit itself to managing information
like a computer does, because it must also procure the matter and energy
to function, repair itself, build a copy of itself, and avoid predators,
all functions that computers do not perform. Above all, the cell must
know how to manage everything and maintain its unity of purpose and
action even in unpredictable environmental conditions.</p>
<p>With reproduction, the cell gives life to a “duplicate” that includes
hardware and software, to ensure the continuity of its species. This
accomplishment is truly amazing, even though we hardly recognize its
magnificence given its ubiquity. However, ubiquity does not mean simple
and easy, for no computer can perform such a feat. To behave like cells,
computers would have to be built using the principles of life, not those
of industrial production and classical computing. To reproduce, the
matter of the computer would have to continuously flow in and out of the
environment, like in a cell. During reproduction, the matter taken from
the environment must be deeply reorganized to produce a copy of itself
within itself, hardware and software included. No one knows how to
perform such an amazing feat.</p>
<h1 id="there-is-more-to-information-than-symbols">There Is More to
Information Than Symbols</h1>
<p>It is not the circumstance that matters, but the lesson learned. Not
the symbol, but its meaning. Not what is outside, but what happens
inside. —Richard Bach, Biplane</p>
<p>I believe it is crucial for any living organism, from cell to human,
to be able to predict the next event that will be experienced. This
requires that much of the information processing be dedicated to the
prediction of future events. This is the basis of a learning process in
which the differences between the predicted event and the one
experienced produce the necessary “error signals” that allow us to
gradually create a model of reality as accurate as possible. I think
that DNA may greatly contribute to this crucial function. It makes sense
for me to conjecture that the main DNA function may well be to embody
the “model of reality” for a particular species, collectively built over
its evolutionary history and summarizing the lessons learned by billions
and billions of individuals.</p>
<p>In a computer, the next event is the next instruction that is already
in memory, except for the inputs that come from the environment, and are
thus unknown. Since deterministic events have probability 1 of occurring
(for the event is certain), the concept of information does not make
sense when a computer operates as a fully deterministic system. It makes
sense, however, when the computer tries to predict the inputs it will
receive from the environment based on its past history, which is an
essential task for artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>
<p>The use of artificial neural networks has allowed us to develop
adaptive models capable of predicting the most likely “input events” for
a certain class of problems. For example, the evolution of the stock
market for an AI “stock trader” or the next road-event for an autonomous
car. In the real world, however, there will always be surprises. In this
case, estimating the possible future events and their probabilities is
the next best strategy. However, this knowledge is not sufficient to
correctly determine the next event in an unpredictable world. This
all-important task can only be accomplished—and only partially—by
comprehension, a fundamental, nonalgorithmic property of consciousness
that exists in living organisms but not in computers, as we will discuss
later. Note also that a truly creative event could not be part of the
alphabet of events to which we could assign a probability, since that
event never existed before.</p>
<p>Another important point is that the classical observer in physics
typically corresponds to a reference system in which the measurement of
an objective event is made, without any concern about the meaning of
what is measured. In other words, it is assumed that the same event
brings the same amount of information to all observers. However, this is
not the case for living organisms, since the same event conveys many
different meanings depending on the individual. Consequently, the
reductionist concept of information, which is appropriate for computers
and classical observers, is totally inadequate to describe the reality
of living organisms.</p>
<p>A computer only needs to correctly recognize the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mn>66</mn></msup><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{66}0^{,}</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mi>∘</mi><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>∘</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{\circ\circ}1^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math>
states in each of its information nodes. That is all, because there are
no other symbols in its repertoire. A computer has no consciousness,
while living organisms are conscious. A computer is just the sum of its
parts and does not have a “self,” therefore it cannot have consciousness
and free will. A living organism is instead “integrated” with a
conscious self that is more than the sum of its physical parts.
Therefore, the conscious self can change the actions of its parts based
on its comprehension.</p>
<p>For example, when an event is novel, a conscious entity becomes
curious about it, and this curiosity motivates its exploration.
Comprehension and curiosity are non-algorithmic properties that emerge
within the entity’s consciousness that can “supervise” the mechanical
aspects of the body, for these are neither part of the “program” nor
part of the “hardware.” This is not the case for a computer, because
everything that happens in it is either part of its program, or it comes
from an external agent independent from it.</p>
<p>Here I have mentioned another fundamental aspect of consciousness
that allows a living organism to “know that it does not know,” and
therefore it can mobilize itself, as an organism, to understand the
“anomaly,” and thus arrive at new comprehensions.</p>
<p>In a computer there are only local processes without the global and
unified perspective of a conscious self, which to exist must be more
than the sum of the parts, because the self must be able to influence
the parts independently of them. We will see later that consciousness
and free will are quantum properties of nature that cannot exist in a
classical computer system, because they emerge from the quantum
entanglement that does not exist in classical physics.</p>
<p>Attributing consciousness, comprehension, and free will to robots and
AI systems is therefore misleading and dangerous. In a computer, the
presence of a single bit in the state “1” could, for example, mean
“launch a missile with a nuclear bomb” or it could represent the least
significant digit of a decimal number—a negligible value. Its actual
meaning depends on when and where that specific bit will be read and
“interpreted” within the program. The interpretation, however, is
deterministic and involves no judgment.</p>
<h1 id="information-meets-consciousness">Information Meets
Consciousness</h1>
<p>In this regard, I would like to recall that on 26 September 1983, in
the midst of the Cold War, the world was saved from nuclear disaster
thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov, who did not trust the
data sent by the satellites announcing the imminent attack of atomic
missiles launched by the USA against the Soviet Union. “I was an
analyst, I was sure it was a mistake: my intuition told me.” Convinced
it was some error, Petrov did not communicate to his superiors that an
attack was imminent, and he saved the planet. “Maybe I decided this way
because I was the only one who had a civilian education, while all the
other employees were soldiers used to giving and following orders.”</p>
<p>It was very fortunate for humankind that it was Petrov on duty that
night. What would have happened if he had been replaced by a soldier
trained to obey without questioning? Or worse still, what if there was a
robot on duty?</p>
<p>When a human being behaves unconsciously, he seems to act like an
automaton, but with a fundamental difference: there is a subconscious
“presence” that can intervene and involve his full consciousness when he
recognizes that the body is about to make an important decision. Even a
protozoan, although it is only a unicellular organism, is conscious and
autonomous. And its consciousness must make the crucial decisions
related to its survival, based on its limited understanding of the
situation.</p>
<p>It is the consciousness that comprehends and, through the organism,
has a first-person experience of itself and of the world. The physical
changes in the organism, therefore, follow the comprehension achieved by
consciousness.</p>
<h1 id="live-information">Live Information</h1>
<p>Language is the house of being and in its abode man lives.</p>
<p>Based on the previous considerations, the nature of information in
living organisms cannot be the same as the one valid for computers. As
already mentioned, the clear separation between hardware, software, and
power supply that exists in computers is not present in a cell. A
specific molecule inside a cell can be construction material (hardware),
energy (power supply), and information (software), depending on the
circumstances. In other words, matter, energy, and information form a
unit that I call live information to distinguish it from Shannon’s
information, which is inadequate, by itself, to describe the functioning
of a cell.</p>
<p>Moreover, the constant flow of live information, i.e., of
matterinformation-energy, inside and outside the cell, is an indication
that live information exists both inside and outside the membrane that
we imagine to be its boundary. The physical structure of the cell is not
only dynamic but is also constantly evolving, because the matter that
enters is not the same matter that exits and the cell changes at every
instant.</p>
<p>But there is more, because we must also take into account the
intentional behavior that comes, in the model I will discuss in later
chapters, from the conscious entity that communicates with the organism
but is not part of it. This is another important difference that
distinguishes computers, in which the whole is simply the sum of its
parts, from living organisms. In fact, the behavior of a computer is
entirely determined by that of its parts, and therefore causality
proceeds only from the parts to the whole (feedforward or bottom-up).
The computer is not an independent whole, but only the sum of its parts.
There is nothing that can change the behavior of the parts that is not
another part.</p>
<p>In a living organism, on the other hand, there is also a conscious
entity that is a unit independent from the physical parts. That unit can
therefore influence the behavior of the parts through feedback
mechanisms (top-down or from the whole to the parts), about which for
the moment little is known. Live information is the informational,
energetic, and material aspects of living organisms that can only be
explained with quantum physics. It is the “stuff” that moves inside the
cell, interacts and combines with other matter, generates and consumes
energy, processes and communicates information, transports material,
disassembles and assembles molecular structures while being buffeted by
the imponderable fluctuations of the quantum vacuum. All these functions
go well beyond the classical behavior of elementary particles and atoms
that make up the physical world we can measure.</p>
<p>The classical concept of “particle as an object” does not exist in
quantum physics, and therefore the classical ideas we have about the
functioning of life are completely inadequate. Life has been studied as
if it were the result of interactions of biochemical molecules imagined
as classical objects, despite the evidence that even large molecules
composed of hundreds of atoms can “interfere” with themselves [6].</p>
<p>Reductionism has allowed us to build remarkably complex machines, but
these are far from resembling living organisms. In a computer, the
hardware is fixed and separate from the software. In a cell, hardware
changes all the time and software does not exist apart from it. The only
area in which there is some similarity with a computer is in the coding
DNA, which, however, represents only
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5\%</annotation></semantics></math>
of all human DNA. In a cell, everything is dynamical and interacting
through live information, not only within the cell itself but also in
the cell’s interactions with the environment. Therefore, the classical
distinctions valid for computers are not applicable to living cells, and
the same goes for the brain.</p>
<p>The matter, energy, and information of an elementary particle are not
separable. For example, a photon is mainly information and action.
However, when its energy is very high, it can also spontaneously “decay”
into matter, and vice versa.2 Reality is irreducibly holistic and
dynamic. Everything is interconnected and constantly evolving. The
concepts of separation and independence, which are adequate to describe
classical objects, cannot portray quantum reality due to the
superposition and entanglement of the states that exist in quantum
systems.</p>
<p>Cells process information by combining analog, digital, classical,
and quantum computational principles. To truly understand life, we must
study its activity at three interacting levels: informational,
structural, and energetic.</p>
<p>This is difficult because these levels are not separable as in a
computer. In living organisms, each aspect also contains a part of the
other two with proportions that change according to local circumstances
that include thousands of interacting atoms. This integration reflects
the physical unity of the organism, to which we need to add the actions
guided by the consciousness and free will of the entity that interacts
with the organism.</p>
<p>We cannot study living organisms as if they were only classical
physical objects, because consciousness and free will are fundamental
and quantum, as we will discuss later. If we do not accept their
existence, we will never be able to comprehend life. Life is an
expression of consciousness and free will, not the result of random
interactions of inanimate matter. Live information and meaning
represent, respectively, the symbolic and semantic aspects of an
indivisible, dynamic reality.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-languages">The Nature of Languages</h1>
<p>That there are different languages is the most mysterious fact in the
world. It means that there are different names for the same things; it
makes us doubt that they are the same things.</p>
<p>—Elias Canetti, The Province of Man</p>
<p>A language is a system of symbols necessary for communication among
conscious entities. This takes place through a dialogue, i.e., the
repetition of communication cycles consisting of a phase in which inner
meaning is converted into outer symbols followed by a second phase in
which outer symbols are converted into inner meaning. Words were among
the first symbols used by human beings to communicate when facial
expressions, hand gestures, and guttural sounds became inadequate to
encode more complex meanings. According to anthropologist Gregory
Bateson, as expressed in The Excitement of the French: “We must assume
that a language is first of all a system of gestures. After all, animals
have only gestures and tones of voice…and words were invented later.
Much later.”</p>
<p>The next step was to convert the fleeting words into written symbols
to create a permanent record. This step took a lot of abstraction and a
long time to be accomplished. In early cultures, the translation from
sound (word) to written symbol was direct, using a symbol for each word
(ideogram). This method required the learning of as many symbols as
there are words. Someone later realized that spoken words use various
combinations of a small number of stereotyped sounds called phonemes,
therefore a simpler scheme could be implemented by associating a symbol
to each phoneme. A further abstraction was the creation of our common
phonetic alphabets. The sound of a word pronounced in isolation could
therefore be converted into a sequence of letters of the alphabet with
an almost one-to-one correspondence between sound and symbol.</p>
<p>However, the sound of a word pronounced in normal speech also depends
on the particular emphasis with which it is modulated to express
emotions. This part of the sound, called prosody, affects many phonemes
at the same time and cannot be easily translated into written symbols,
although it can be partially duplicated by a good reader who comprehends
what he is reading. Prosody describes the intonation, rhythm, and accent
of the spoken language. These are “wave” phenomena that change the waves
of the “normal” phonemes used in the words of a modulated sentence.
Prosody is not represented in the symbols of the written language.</p>
<p>Therefore, by moving from spoken words to written text, some
important contextual information was lost. In some languages, especially
English, there is also ambiguity in the conversion from sound to text
for certain words, since a different spelling can correspond to the same
sound and, in some other cases, the same spelling can have different
sounds. Consequently, additional contextual information is needed to
accurately translate the sounds into the correct text, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>Any list of symbols can be easily converted into another list of
symbols, as long as there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
items in the two lists. For example, converting a list of decimal
numbers into a corresponding list of binary numbers requires a trivial
algorithm, although many people would find this process laborious and
error-prone. However, when symbol and meaning have a one-to-many
correspondence, as is the case with human language, the ambiguity can
only be resolved by widening the interpretative context. This is the
main reason why speech and human handwriting recognition are such
difficult problems to solve in the field of artificial intelligence in
which comprehension does not exist.</p>
<p>The conversion from meaning to symbols and from symbols to meaning is
at the heart of human communication and comprehension. This is a very
difficult problem because it shows that our verbal communications cannot
be entirely classic, as is normally assumed. Only the comprehension
occurring within our consciousness allows us to communicate without too
many problems.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the statistical properties of phonemes have
similar regularities in all human languages. The same is true for the
letters of the various phonetic alphabets which are used to translate
phonemes into written words. It is significant that, in any sufficiently
long text, each letter appears with the same relative frequency
(probability) regardless of the meaning expressed by the text. This
invariance of the probability distribution of phonemes from the meaning
carried by the text is found in all human languages. This should not be
surprising since each word is a short sequence of the same small set of
symbols. In other words, the meaning is carried by the specific order of
the words in a sentence, whereas the probabilities of the phonemes in a
long string of them are independent from that order. This is why the
meaning cannot be found in the probability distribution of the symbols
used to represent it. But this does not authorize us to say that meaning
does not exist.</p>
<p>If we now consider the atoms and molecules of living organisms as the
elementary symbols that express the meaning of the organisms, we will
find the same independence of meaning from the probabilities of those
symbols. For example, two different single-cell organisms, such as an
amoeba and a paramecium, will have the same relative frequency of the
atoms that compose them (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc.), and yet their
meaning will be quite different. In other words, the atoms that make up
the cells are like the letters of the alphabet with which we write our
books. Every living organism is therefore like a book that contains from
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>10</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{10}</annotation></semantics></math>

of the mass of the human body is made up of six different atoms
(hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus) and only
17 elements are indispensable for our survival. It seems incredible, but
the maximum number of elements used by the entire earth ecosystem is
less than 40. Therefore the number of “characters” necessary to “write”
the dynamic “book” of any existing organism is commensurable to the
number of letters of our phonetic alphabets. And the probabilities of
manifestation of the elementary symbols of life remain essentially the
same for all the organisms of the same kingdom.</p>
<p>However, the analogy ends here, because books are static and produced
with printing presses, while life is incredibly dynamic—it
self-reproduces, and evolves.</p>
<h1 id="is-there-meaning-in-the-universe">Is There Meaning in the
Universe?</h1>
<p>Only open eyes can discover that the universe is the book of the
highest Truth.</p>
<p>—Jalal al-Din Rumi</p>
<p>A few centuries ago, many scholars had embraced Cartesian dualism
which drew a clear division between mind and matter. However, recent
advances in physics have shown that reality is holistic and therefore
there can be no separation between mind and matter. Consequently,
consciousness must be brought into the domain of physics and can no
longer be ignored. However, how can a physics entirely based on
objective information explain the existence of consciousness when
meaningless symbols can only be transformed into other meaningless
symbols? How can we bring into physics the meaning that each of us knows
exists in our consciousness? For sure, the concept of information is
closer to consciousness than matter is.</p>
<p>In the field of physics, the idea that information could be more
fundamental than matter was first advanced by John Wheeler in 1995 with
the catchy phrase “it from bit.” The basic idea is that every thing is
made up of bits, that is, of information. Recently, the theoretical
physicist Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano and his collaborators have shown that
quantum mechanics and free quantum field theory can be derived entirely
from six purely informational postulates [7], validating John Wheeler’s
intuition. Quantum physics could then be interpreted as follows:
matter-energy is simply “made” of organizations of quantum bits, or
qubits, which manifest themselves in the form of classical bits when
they are observed. The qubit is the generalization of the Boolean bit
used in classical computers. The qubit represents all possible quantum
states obtained by the quantum superposition of the simplest
complementary quantum states that can be represented by all the points
on the surface of a sphere of radius 1, called the Bloch sphere.</p>
<p>In nature we have a clear example of a qubit in the direction of the
magnetic moment (spin) of an electron. When the spin is measured, we
will inevitably find it either “up” or “down,” in the same or in the
opposite direction of the magnetic field of the measuring instrument.
Qubits can also be entangled, i.e., they can have correlated states that
persist regardless of the probable outcomes of the measurements. The
quantum superposition of states and entanglement (see Glossary) provide
us with representational and information-processing capabilities that
have no equivalent in the classical world. Ultimately, the quantum world
is a much vaster reality than the classical one.</p>
<p>I too believe that information is a more basic aspect of reality than
matter, as long as it is live information inseparable from its meaning,
since meaning cannot emerge from information that is devoid of it.
Meaning must be an integral part of that same “substance” that manifests
itself as live information when we measure it. For true communication to
exist, meaning must also exist within the communicating entities,
otherwise the symbols could not be comprehended.</p>
<p>I emphasize again that what we measure in our physical world can only
give us Boolean information (bits). The classical bit cannot fully
represent quantum information that requires entangled qubits represented
with vectors in a complex N-dimensional Hilbert space. In other words,
the quantum world has a far vaster number of states than the ones
existing in the classical world. This is already evident at the level of
a single qubit, which represents an infinity of states, and that will
always give us only one classical bit when measured.</p>
<p>Quantum computers, for example, cannot exist entirely in our physical
world; only the setting of the program, the initial conditions, and the
recording of the result of the calculation can be obtained in the
classical world as classical information. Quantum information processing
cannot be openly performed in spacetime with classical matter, because
qubits and their entanglement are nonlocal properties. So where does
quantum computation take place? This question has puzzled physicists
since the inception of this technology, but there is still no adequate
answer.</p>
<p>However, quantum computers, as they are currently conceived, are
deterministic systems and therefore cannot make free-will decisions.
Moreover, the algorithms that can be processed by quantum computers
could also be processed by a classical computer, but at a much lower
speed. However, no quantum or classical computer could compute the
states determined by free-will choices. These choices are creative,
therefore they cannot be determined or predicted by any algorithm. To
have both free will and consciousness requires a more general quantum
system than a deterministic quantum computer. The Operational
Probabilistic Theory (OPT) developed by D’Ariano and collaborators [8]
can explain the existence of such systems, as will be seen in later
chapters.</p>
<p>A photon with an energy of

(known as a gamma ray) near an atomic nucleus can decay 2 into an
electron-positron pair by converting its entire energy into the rest
masses of an electron and a positron (the latter is an electron with
positive rather than negative charge). Since the rest masses of the
electron and positron are

each, the energy of the photon in excess of 1.02 MeV is converted into
the kinetic energy of the electron and positron. This process can also
occur in the other direction, meaning that if an electron and a positron
meet, they produce two or more photons.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-life">The Nature of Life</h1>
<p>When you wake up in the morning, remember what a precious privilege
it is to be alive: to breathe, to think, to feel joy, and to love.
—Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p>The more we become aware, the more we appreciate life; this life so
fascinating, unpredictable, simple and complicated, old and new, full of
lights and shadows, and mystery…</p>
<p>This life—we don’t know “if it is a journey, if it is a dream, if it
is awaited, if it is a plan that takes place day after day and you do
not notice it except by looking backwards” (Jorge Luis Borges).</p>
<p>This life which is “too good to be meaningless” (Charlie
Chaplin).</p>
<p>This life, strong and fragile, just and unjust, positive and
negative, and so unfathomable…</p>
<p>This life that “asks you, takes away, cuts you, breaks you,
disappoints you, breaks you…until only love remains in you” (Bert
Hellinger).</p>
<h1 id="the-incredible-complexity-of-a-paramecium">The Incredible
Complexity of a Paramecium</h1>
<p>Nature is great in great things, but is greatest in small things.
—Pliny the Elder</p>
<p>Many years ago, I saw a short documentary about a paramecium swimming
in a drop of water. A paramecium is a protozoan, a single-celled animal
about a tenth of a millimeter long whose body is covered with thousands
of cilia:</p>
<p>microscopic “whiskers” that beat in unison to propel it. Well, this
tiny little creature could swim fast, avoid obstacles, search for food,
and recognize another paramecium to mate with. It behaved intelligently
and purposefully, exactly like a little fish.</p>
<p>But how is it possible that a single cell, devoid of a nervous
system, can process information in such an exquisite manner, and be
capable of reproducing by building a copy of itself within itself? No
engineer has ever been able to build a computer that can assemble a copy
of itself within itself —hardware and software included—and then split
into two complete computers! To this day AI is far from reaching not
only human creative intelligence, but also the intelligence of the
simplest single-cell organism, such as a paramecium or an amoeba.</p>
<p>These are unparalleled feats. There must be something fundamental in
life that we do not yet understand. In fact, living organisms have
unique and special properties compared to inanimate objects that our
ancestors also understood quite well. And, as the British neuroscientist
Francis Crick puts it: “The development of biology will destroy our
traditional beliefs and it is not easy to understand what it will put in
their place.”</p>
<p>In my opinion, life cannot be explained only with biochemistry, but
requires the new concept of live information, which is inseparable from
the consciousness and the free will of quantum entities.</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-biology">A Brief History of Biology</h1>
<p>Many scholars believe that biology as a science began around 1670,
when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, using a microscope, first saw that living
tissues are composed of cells. He also discovered the first
single-celled organisms, hitherto not even imagined, which he called
animalcules.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the nineteenth century, the cellular theory of
life proposed in 1839 by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann became
generally accepted by the scientific community. This theory postulates
that the basic unit of life is the cell, that cells are produced by
other cells, and that each cell has all the characteristics of life.1
Twenty years later, the idea of evolution by natural selection,
introduced in 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin’s The Origin
of Species, had a huge impact, even though for more than a century it
was the subject of much criticism and debate. Darwin himself, in a
letter of 1844, wrote that for him discovering that species are not
immutable was like “confessing a crime.” Nonetheless his writing
provided convincing evidence of evolution and was defined by the
biologist Thomas Henry Huxley as “the most powerful tool that men have
at their fingertips, after the publication of Newton’s Principia, to
expand the field of natural knowledge.”</p>
<p>Between the 1930s and 1940s, thanks to the contribution of many
scientists, the integration of various theories on genetics, evolution,
and paleontology took place, leading to an evolutionary theory called
the Modern Synthesis of Evolution, or Neo-Darwinian Synthesis. This
theory explained how new species emerged and became widely accepted.
However, some of its principles, such as the inability of an organism to
transmit to its progeny traits acquired during its life, are currently
being challenged by new discoveries in epigenetics.2</p>
<p>The recognition of the existence of a “unit of inheritance,” later
called the gene, began with the work of the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel,
published in 1866, but ignored until 1900, the same year Planck advanced
the idea of the quantum of action, another fundamental “unit.” In 1930
it was suspected that DNA was the biomolecule responsible for heredity,
but how it worked was unknown until the discovery of the helical
structure of DNA in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick.</p>
<p>Several years later, the genetic code was understood and unveiled
and, finally, the entire human genome was decoded with a massive
cooperative program that spanned from 1990 to 2003.</p>
<p>DNA is truly mind-blowing. As the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson
states: “There are as many atoms in a single molecule of your DNA as
there are stars in a typical galaxy. We are, each of us, a small
Universe.”</p>
<p>In the early days of biology, it was thought that only living
organisms could create biomolecules. In 1828 Friedrich Wöhler managed to
synthesize urea, demonstrating that there was no difference between the
urea produced by living organisms and the organic compound of the same
name synthesized in the laboratory. It could be said that the beginning
of biochemistry took place from that date, although most historians
prefer to consider 1833 as the “dawn of biochemistry,” the year in which
Anselme Payen discovered amylase, i.e., the first enzyme. From that
moment on, life began to be more and more identified with biochemical
processes. With the discovery in 1961 of the genetic code embedded in
the DNA, life also became connected with the nascent science of
information.</p>
<p>The notion of a biochemical basis of life was developed by many
biochemists and biophysicists throughout much of the twentieth century,
thanks to the new and deeper understanding of atomic and molecular
structures provided by quantum physics. Let’s not forget, however, the
indispensable help of many new and powerful tools, including the
electron microscope, which for the first time made it possible to
examine what was too small to be seen through optical microscopes.
Indeed, quantum physics gave birth to quantum chemistry, completely
transforming a purely empirical science into one based on its solid
theoretical foundations.</p>
<p>For much of the past century, living organisms have been studied
primarily as biochemical systems. Only in the last 20 years has the idea
begun to take hold that biology may have more to do with information
than biochemistry. But this conversion is slow, because the problems
that molecular biologists are called to solve are incredibly difficult
and require familiarity with information science, quantum physics,
computers, and artificial intelligence. Let’s imagine what would have
happened if 100 years ago a team of the best scientists had been given
one of the most sophisticated systems-on-a-chip built today with the
task of understanding how it works. Without electron microscopes,
oscilloscopes, and other essential instruments, and without knowing
anything about microelectronics, computers, and software, their work
would have been absolutely hopeless.</p>
<h1 id="life-is-dynamic">Life Is Dynamic</h1>
<p>Panta rei (Everything flows). —Heraclitus</p>
<p>All living organisms, from bacteria to the entire ecosystem, are
open, dynamic, and far-from-equilibrium systems that exchange matter,
energy, and information with the environment and are constantly
evolving. It can be said, together with Heraclitus, that “There is no
permanent reality except for the reality of change: permanence is an
illusion of the senses.” Undoubtedly, one of the essential properties of
life is the capacity to reproduce and therefore to give life to new,
independent, and autonomous organisms. It is a truly amazing
capability.</p>
<p>With all our scientific and technological prowess, could we build a
computer that can do the same? Absolutely not! A computer can only copy
the programs stored in its memory, creating an appearance of
life—artificial life —but it cannot create another computer within
itself. No artificial machine has ever reached the level of dynamism and
openness to the environment that life has managed. In theory, 100 to 200
years from now, it could happen that robots may go to a 3D-printing
center, connect their “artificial genome” to the “printer,” and an
identical robot will be assembled, a tiny drop at a time. In this case,
would the life and existence of robots be the same as ours?</p>
<p>No, because robots would continue to be built “from the outside,” and
not “from the inside out,” as is the case with living organisms. Each
droplet added by the printer will not contain the genome of the entire
robot like our cells do. As such, these robots could neither be
conscious nor have free will, as I will gradually explain in the course
of the book. And, despite their sophistication, those future “printed”
robots would be purely classical machines made of inert, classical
parts. Only with “quantum components” is it possible to construct living
and autonomous organisms from the inside out.</p>
<h1 id="life-is-holistic">Life Is Holistic</h1>
<p>You are made up of a hundred trillion cells. Each of us is a
multitude.</p>
<p>—Carl Sagan</p>
<p>Life is a holistic system because everything is interconnected, and
therefore it cannot be explained as if it were made of separable parts.
Every living organism is in symbiosis with the environment and interacts
continuously with other members of its own and other species, such as
predators, prey, and those it collaborates with.</p>
<p>Due to this strong interdependence with the environment, an organism
cannot be studied on its own without crucial information being lost.
Life works best when there is a dynamic balance of give-and-take between
each organism and its habitat. If this principle is not respected, the
consequences will eventually become serious.</p>
<p>To explain the remarkable autonomy and the intentional and
intelligent behavior of living organisms, we must assume that each of
them is “connected” with a conscious entity with free will.
Consciousness is the ability to have an inner experience and know
oneself, while free will is the ability to choose how to act in the
world.</p>
<p>The free-will action has a subjective and an objective aspect like
live information. The subjective aspect expresses the intention,
purpose, and experience of the conscious entity that controls the
organism acting in the outer reality. The objective aspect is due to the
learning process of the organism “supervised” by the consciousness and
free will that leads to the creation of stereotyped behaviors. These
behaviors become part of the autonomous repertoire of the organism and
will occur with a certain probability that may be predictable by an
outside observer. However, the presence of consciousness and free will
allows the organism to change the learned behaviors in a creative and
unpredictable way, when needed. This is an impossible feat for
robots.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the irreducible existence of an
individual consciousness in every living organism. For example, we
cannot explain the coherent and intelligent behavior of a paramecium in
a widely unpredictable environment without there being a central,
creative function that coordinates its actions as a unit. Just as we
have consciousness and free will, so every cell in our body must also
share the same properties. This is possible because the essence of the
whole is present in each of its parts, namely, in each of our cells is
present the DNA of the fertilized egg from which our body originated.
The claim that consciousness and free will emerge from elementary
particles and atoms that do not have the same properties makes no sense.
It would be like claiming that electromagnetism emerges from elementary
particles devoid of electric charge and magnetic spin.</p>
<p>Considering that life is holistic, the essence of the whole must be
contained in each of its parts. Therefore, no part can be completely
separated from the whole, and this in turn means that no part can be a
closed system. As I discussed earlier, reductionism is a theory that
simplifies reality by neglecting the weak connections each part has with
the environment. Often, this is done to predict the behavior of a
limited number of parts that interact strongly with each other. However,
the success of this strategy does not justify the claim that the
universe is reductionist, especially if we consider the enormous dynamic
range of the natural forces that affect matter. For example, the
electromagnetic force that binds electrons to the nuclei of atoms is
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2.2</mn><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>39</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2.2{\cdot}10^{39}</annotation></semantics></math>
times stronger than the gravitational force between them. That is 39
orders of magnitude! Nonetheless, this extremely weak gravitational
force is what allowed the formation of stars that have synthesized in
their interiors all the nuclei of the chemical elements (except for
hydrogen, deuterium, a small amount of helium, and traces of lithium).
We exist on this planet thanks to the actions of the weakest force there
is!</p>
<p>I imagine consciousness as a holistic property that is supported by a
near-infinity of invisible connections that are neglected when simple
systems are studied in a reductive way. For example, a eukaryotic cell
is a complex system made up of more than
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>14</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{14}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms and each atom can interact with many other neighbors. Hence the
number of possible interactions is much greater than the number of
particles that make up the cell. Every interaction is an exchange of
information that creates a connection between the parts that contribute
to the consciousness of the whole. I think it is plausible that a
conscious entity with free will cannot have a direct experience in the
physical world with a structure simpler than that of the simplest known
bacterium, which totals about
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>10</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{10}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms.3 Such atoms interact in a sophisticated way to produce a robust
homeostatic metabolic system that reproduces itself and behaves in
essence like the paramecium described above.</p>
<p>Each of us is a conscious organism and every cell of our body
contains the genome of the whole organism4 so that the consciousness of
a multicellular organism must be present and active in all its essential
parts, i.e., the cells, which are also conscious. However, the
consciousness of the entity is not a simple sum of the consciousnesses
of its parts, but is much more. The unity of the organism comes from its
consciousness. Consciousness is the whole that is more than the sum of
the parts, as we will see later.</p>
<p>In summary, to fully understand living organisms, we must imagine
them as dynamic energy that is simultaneously transformed into its three
objective dimensions of matter, information, and energy supervised by
the deeper inner subjective properties of consciousness and free will,
which are properties that can only exist in the quantum reality.</p>
<h1 id="the-strategies-of-life">The Strategies of Life</h1>
<p>And everything surprises me. Life is an inexplicable magic. —Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe</p>
<p>The strategies used by life are truly amazing. Let’s start for
example with the first and simplest living organisms: cyanobacteria.
They are single-celled prokaryotes (cells without a nucleus) that use
sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\mathrm{CO}_{2})</annotation></semantics></math>
to synthesize glucose and discard the excess oxygen

produced by the internal chemical reactions fueled by light. Thanks to
this process, called photosynthesis, the atmosphere of the primordial
earth rich in
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
was gradually transformed into one rich in
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{O}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
. The large amount of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{O}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
discarded by cyanobacteria then allowed the emergence of a new energetic
path in which the chemical energy of glucose was exploited by using
oxygen and discarding carbon dioxide. In this way, a new balance was
created in the atmosphere, in which the food of one part of the
ecosystem was the waste of the other, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This became the basic homeostatic cycle between all of life and the
inanimate environment, allowing the maintenance of the optimal
proportions of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{O}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
in the Earth’s atmosphere to support the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria feeding on sunlight,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
, water, and various other minerals present in the soil, multiplied
exponentially and colonized the Earth, forming a second layer of
biomolecules that evolved, in turn producing changes in the inorganic
matter of the planet—the first layer—from which they emerged.</p>
<p>Using the biomolecules of dead bacteria and the same basic
metabolism, new species of cyanobacteria emerged later, and from the
first two layers a third was formed, capable of utilizing the waste
products of the second layer,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi>.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{O}_{2}.</annotation></semantics></math>
, the glucose of dead cells, and a new metabolic path whose creation is
a mystery. These new species of aerobic bacteria (oxygen-breathing
bacteria) also provided new organic molecules that could be used to
create new species of aerobic and anaerobic cyanobacteria (
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
-breathing bacteria). In this fashion, the survival of the third layer
became dependent on the existence of the other two, and the long-term
survival of the second layer was ensured by the waste products of the
third layer.</p>
<p>The creativity and cooperation expressed by the organisms of the
third layer in supplying
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
and using the biomolecules left behind by their decaying bodies proved
to be a winning strategy. In fact, the anaerobic organisms, by consuming
all the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
present in the atmosphere, would have ended up extinct.</p>
<p>Finally, when the glucose contained in the dead cyanobacteria was no
longer sufficient to support the growing aerobic species, new species
emerged capable of eating the living ones.</p>
<p>Life always finds new strategies to be able to expand, including that
of “consuming” its own. This means that a species survives at the
expense of a certain percentage of its individuals that fall prey. In
other words, mors tua, vita mea (your death is my life). In fact, we can
see that even death is life, because the food of one form of life is
either the waste, the dead body, or the alive body of another form of
life. This strategy allows a dynamic balance to be achieved within the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>When this balance is disturbed too quickly, the ecosystem may not be
able to rebalance itself in time, causing the environmental conditions
to change drastically to the point where mors tua, mors mea (your death
is my death). This is what is unfortunately happening in this period of
climatic upheavals.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see how living organisms have found a way to develop
such a dense network of interactions that an ecosystem of astounding
complexity and beauty was created by ultimately transforming only
inorganic matter and sunlight!</p>
<h1 id="life-as-an-ecosystem">Life as an Ecosystem</h1>
<p>Let’s treat the land we live on well: it was not given to us by our
fathers, but it was lent to us by our children.</p>
<p>—Masai proverb</p>
<p>We can visualize the ecosystem as a system of systems in which many
species interact with each other and with the environment. Each species
is made up of many individuals, and each individual is made up of one or
more cells.</p>
<p>The cells that combine to form complex multicellular organisms are
nucleated cells called eukaryotes, and they in turn contain simpler
cells without nuclei called prokaryotes, or bacteria. We can imagine
prokaryotes as the “elementary particles” of life, combining to produce
its atoms, the eukaryotes. Eukaryotes in turn combine to form molecules
and macromolecules of life of unbelievable complexity and diversity that
in this analogy correspond to multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>To live and reproduce, an organism requires the ability to
self-regulate and obtain food, that is, a supply of matter, energy, and
information from the environment. The capacity for self-regulation,
called homeostasis, allows organisms to maintain their internal
stability through many dynamic, interoperable processes that use
negative feedback. Stability is achieved through a dynamic equilibrium
around certain set points, just like in a thermostat that automatically
regulates the temperature in our homes. Of course, within a cell there
are homeostatic cycles inside other homeostatic cycles at many levels,
creating a system of disconcerting complexity, even though the basic
operating principle of each cycle is always the same. The principle
involves measuring the value of the variable to be controlled, comparing
it with a predetermined value, and then guiding the process until the
difference between the two becomes negligible.</p>
<p>Homeostasis occurs at all levels: within a single cell, between the
cells of an organ, between the organs of an organism, between
individuals of the same species, in interspecies dynamics, and finally
in the relationship of the entire ecosystem with the inorganic
environment, as we have already seen with the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{O}_{2}{-}\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
homeostatic cycle.</p>
<p>The Gaia hypothesis, advanced by James Lovelock and developed
together with Lynn Margulis in the 1970s, argues that the entire Earth
is a single living organism. Life as ecosystem regulates the physical
conditions of the planet to survive, even in the event of severe
environmental disturbances caused by extraordinary terrestrial and
extraterrestrial events, such as volcanic eruptions, meteorites, and
solar flares. The dependence of each animal on their common environment
creates a system of unthinkable complexity, because the environment
depends to a certain extent on the actions of each organism, the Earth
itself, the solar system, and beyond. Everything is interconnected. “We
are part of nature, the trees are our brothers, the mountains think and
feel. All this is part of our wisdom, of the memory of the creation of
the world” (Ailton Krenak).</p>
<p>In this homeostatic and dynamic ecosystem, the survival of any
species depends on a give-and-take, on a continuous cooperation that
must find its balance. According to a 2018 study, the first known mass
extinction, 445 million years ago, may have been caused by very
voracious algae that consumed
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
too quickly to be balanced by the existing homeostatic cycle. The effect
of their greed was a complete freezing of the Earth. It seems that we
are not the first species to cause a change on a planetary scale.</p>
<p>The Homo sapiens species, which so far has taken from the environment
without ever worrying about the consequences, must urgently return to
the ecosystem what it has taken or risk its own extinction and that of
many other species. The delicate balance of nature must be maintained.
There are no exceptions.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution, while on the one hand allowing human
society to progress enormously, on the other hand has caused
environmental changes that are much faster than the response time of the
current homeostatic mechanisms of the planet.</p>
<p>Global warming, deforestation, ocean acidification, continuous wars,
and the specter of a nuclear war are endangering the entire ecosystem on
which all life on the planet depends. “In the name of progress, man is
transforming the world into a fetid and poisonous place…to the point
that it is legitimate to ask whether, in a hundred years, it will still
be possible to live on Earth” (Erich Fromm, Anatomy of Human
Destructiveness). At the 76th General Assembly of the United Nations,
the secretary of the UN, António Guterres, declared: “We see warning
signs in every continent and region, high temperatures; the loss of
biodiversity is shocking, air and water are polluted, climate-related
disasters are evident. We are on the edge of the abyss.”</p>
<p>It is essential that human beings become protectors and guardians of
the environment. In the encyclical Laudato si’, Pope Francis writes that
“to guard means to protect, care, preserve, conserve, watch over. This
implies a relationship of responsible reciprocity between human beings
and nature.” We must be aware, as Pope Francis continues, “of not being
separated from other creatures, but of forming a wonderful universal
communion with the other beings of the universe.” Otherwise, the current
ecosystem can be destroyed and humanity may not survive. As the Italian
European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano says: “Man is at risk,
not the Earth.” In fact, “life continues well beyond the damage we are
doing, because the universe is prepared for life. Life is perfectly
aligned with the principles of physics, so it will continue to exist.”
The Earth will then rebuild a new ecosystem, as it has done many other
times in the past when catastrophic events have dramatically upset the
delicate balance of life, but it is not certain that there will be human
beings in this new system.</p>
<p>Quoting the Polish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer in Old Love: “The
only hope of mankind is love in its various forms and manifestations,
whose only source is love for life.”</p>
<p>The Boundary between Animate and Inanimate Matter Each species within
the gigantic terrestrial ecosystem, itself seen as a single living
organism, can exist only if most of its supporting homeostatic network
continues to exist. This is evident for living organisms, but it is also
true for inanimate matter, as we have seen with the basic
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CO}_{2}{-}\mathrm{O}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>
cycle. There is no sharp dividing line between animate and inanimate
matter, just as there is no sharp boundary between classical and quantum
systems.</p>
<p>An electron cannot exist without the quantum field from which it
emerges. And the quantum field of the electron cannot exist without the
Whole from which quantum fields have emerged. The electron is a
manifestation—a visible, objective state—of the quantum field of
electrons. And “electrons are neither particles nor waves: they are
another thing, completely new. They are quantum states” (Leon Max
Lederman).</p>
<p>We often imagine the electron as a particle or as a wave separate
from the field, while instead it is a set of properties of the field
from which it emerges without detaching from it. The electron is a
“conserved form” that the field takes, inseparable from the field. It is
a piece of field that preserves all its characteristics because it never
separates from it, just as a bacterium is an organism that emerges from
the complex environment formed by the Sun-Earth-Moon system, from which
it never separates.</p>
<p>When we focus our attention only on the bacterium, we only consider
the “particle” or “shape” aspect and we completely lose sight of its
“wave” aspect, which is what connects the bacterium to the whole. The
whole is not only the inanimate background in which the part—the
bacterium—exists, but it is also “inside” the bacterium: it is an
integral and irreducible part of what we call a bacterium, without which
it could not exist. The bacterium does not exist only inside its
membrane, because a moment later a part of what was inside is outside,
and vice versa. The bacterium exists inside-andoutside its membrane in a
dynamism that we often do not appreciate in our need to separate and
place boundaries that do not exist in reality, but only in our limited
comprehension.</p>
<p>A bacterium is a part-whole because it is not separable from the
whole, nor is the whole separable from the part. And an electron is also
a partwhole, molecules are parts-whole, and a human being is a
part-whole. A part-whole is a concept that does not exist in classical
physics where particles are little hard balls, inanimate “objects”
separated from the environment, that only act locally by colliding with
each other. Reductionism has created impassable boundaries that do not
exist in nature.</p>
<p>The “wave” behavior of particles and the existence of entanglement in
quantum physics are telling us that a particle is not an object and that
its impact can be far-reaching. A local interaction of a particle can
have nonlocal consequences that are impossible to know, thus justifying
the partwhole concept and name.</p>
<h1 id="life-is-both-quantum-and-classical">Life Is Both Quantum and
Classical</h1>
<p>There are only two ways of living one’s life: one as if nothing were
a miracle; the other as if everything were a miracle.</p>
<p>—Albert Einstein</p>
<p>If we look critically at eukaryotic cells—the bricks of our body—we
can see that their functioning is completely different from that of our
machines, including computers. Inside the cytoplasm of each cell there
are electrons and protons (hydrogen ions); ions of simple atoms such as
sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and so on; simple molecules such as
glucose and amino acids; complex molecules such as messenger RNA and
proteins; organelles such as ribosomes and DNA; and finally the
mitochondria, which are bacteria, i.e., cells without a nucleus that can
live inside a cell with a nucleus.</p>
<p>A multicellular organism therefore contains many hierarchical levels
of incredible complexity, which work cooperatively with a single purpose
determined locally by the consciousness and free will of each cell, and
globally by the consciousness and free will of the entire organism.</p>
<p>When we manipulate life, we always start with a living cell, not with
its parts, and it is only thanks to its incredible robustness that we
can carry out invasive manipulations without killing it. Everything that
happens in a living organism is not fully understandable within the
reductionist framework of classical physics. There are crucial
properties that can only be explained by quantum physics, and many other
properties that we consider classical are approximations of quantum
properties. However, what we cannot classically explain is the overall
behavior that gives the organism autonomy, intelligence, and the ability
to evolve and reproduce itself as a whole. This is the invisible layer
of the whole that “connects” the parts and that we typically ignore,
intent as we are on explaining the local functioning of the parts.</p>
<p>I believe it is impossible to explain life without the concepts of
consciousness and free will, because the two are inextricably linked to
the quantum-classical aspects of physical reality in ways that we have
yet to investigate and fully understand. A living organism can act as a
unit with free will, intention, purpose, and meaning, properties that
cannot derive from a bag of unconscious atoms and molecules that
interact probabilistically with each other. Consciousness is what gives
perception and understanding to the organism, while free will allows it
to act as a unified entity with its own intention, based on conscious
comprehension.</p>
<p>According to our physical theories, the fields emerge from the
unified field, but they are inseparable from the whole and do not
precede it. In a holographic and holistic universe, the parts that
self-assemble must contain the essence of the whole, and therefore
cannot be separated from it, because the whole must still be capable of
influencing the parts. This is also the reason why elementary particles
making up a living cell are inseparable from the fields of which they
are states; thus they truly are open systems like living cells.</p>
<p>In a reductionist view, each part is a statistical ensemble of closed
systems that collectively behaves like another closed system. Thus the
quantum correlations that maintain the unity of a whole cannot exist.
This is the fundamental reason why our reductionistic classical
machines, such as computers, cannot be conscious and cannot have free
will.</p>
<h1 id="living-organisms-as-information-processors-1">Living Organisms
as Information Processors</h1>
<p>Reductionism has been successful because science has mainly studied
inanimate objects or the functioning of small subsystems within living
organisms without fully comprehending their connection with the whole.
However, to understand how cells process information with quantum parts,
it is necessary to go beyond our reductionist prejudices.</p>
<p>Each machine conceived by a human being is imagined by the designer
as a mechanism suitable for performing a certain function. The inventor
decides which parts are needed, their arrangement, and how they work to
obtain “the whole” that he has in mind. In other words, the whole is not
in the machine, but in the mind of its inventor. The parts simply do
what they are forced to do by the laws of physics skillfully applied by
the inventor. The whole seems to “emerge” from the parts, but in the
machine there is no “whole.” There is only the sum of the parts. A
computer program does exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>A cell is a microscopic quantum-classical system, while a human is a
macroscopic quantum-classical system made up of trillions of cells.
These systems have both probabilistic and deterministic behavior. In the
current state of knowledge, the way in which information is represented
and processed by a cell is essentially unknown, with the exception of
the genetics of proteins and the mechanical interactions of some of
them, which are considered the basic level of information processing in
cells. The functioning of DNA is inextricably connected with the quantum
properties of elementary particles, atoms, and molecules in a complex
dynamical system in which both dynamical order and quantum randomness
are present. As discussed in the previous chapter, only
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5\%</annotation></semantics></math>
of the human genome encodes proteins. Since we have fewer genes than
some flowering plants, it is difficult to argue that the secrets of
human intelligence are contained in the coding DNA. They are most likely
contained in the rest of the DNA, the so-called “junk DNA” that we
discussed earlier.</p>
<p>The success of molecular biology has led us to think that we can
study cells in a reductive way, as if they were classical machines. But
cells are holistic systems in which the whole is more than the sum of
the parts, so I expect that only when we start studying life as
quantum-classical holistic systems will it begin to reveal its deepest
secrets.</p>
<p>The fundamental differences between the information-processing
principles of computers and living systems can be clearly seen when we
reduce the size of transistors inside a microchip. As the size
decreases, the holistic nature of atoms and molecules increasingly
interferes with the deterministic function of transistors, which is
based on the statistical properties of many thousands of atoms and
molecules.</p>
<p>In a cell, however, the quantum properties of individual atoms and
molecules that would compromise the operation of computers are used for
the processing of information, energy, and matter (live information) in
ways that remain largely unknown. Furthermore, when dealing with
electrons, protons, atoms, and simple molecules the concepts of
dimension and separation lose their meaning due to the wave properties
of matter. As I explained in the second chapter in connection with the
double-slit experiment, an electron, as well as an atom or a molecule,
can “interfere with itself” and manifest over a volume of space much
larger than its size.</p>
<p>This fact has profound consequences since, in a quantum system, the
influence of an ion on the surrounding environment goes far beyond its
physical volume, and the details depend on the nature of the
electromagnetic field created by nearby atoms and molecules.
Consequently, the nature of the possible interactions strongly depends
on the contributions of many particles. This makes the rigorous study of
living systems extremely difficult, since the effects of
self-interference have important consequences on information processing.
In other words, the function performed by an ion in a cell depends on
the electric field created by its many, constantly moving neighbors, a
situation that is difficult to compute and nearly impossible to
measure.5</p>
<p>I think that life is a dynamical system performing both quantum and
classical information processing, in which live information is also
connected with the subjective meaning of the organism coming from its
consciousness. Therefore, to understand life, it must be studied in
terms that go beyond those of a reductive biochemical machine. Life is
unbelievably complex and resourceful. We can almost be certain that it
has found a way to use the quantum properties of nature to its advantage
to perform sophisticated information processing in ways we have yet to
imagine.</p>
<p>All the machines we build, including computers, are made by
assembling separate parts. A living cell, on the other hand, cannot be
assembled from its atomic and molecular components. A cell is a
dynamical system of a far greater order of complexity than the machines
we have created because it uses quantum components that have no
definable boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="the-fundamental-differences-between-a-cell-and-a-computer">The
Fundamental Differences between a Cell and a Computer</h1>
<p>The most notable difference between a computer and a cell is that a
computer is made of permanent classical matter, while a cell is made of
dynamic quantum “matter.” Almost all the atoms and molecules in a
microchip are those that were present when the chip was first
manufactured. These atoms and molecules form stable physical structures
that carry information in the form of electrical signals, working like
roads and gates that control the movement of vehicles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the atoms and molecules that enter a cell flow,
transform, and exit so that those that leave the cell are no longer the
ones that entered it. This strategy is indispensable for carrying out
the metabolic and reproductive functions of cells. These atoms
simultaneously transport information, energy, and matter to create the
static and dynamic structures that allow the cell to live and experience
its own existence.</p>
<p>The desire to explain reductionistically the holism of cells has
prompted many researchers to attribute miraculous powers to the modest
selforganization observed in nature in so-called emergent natural
phenomena.6 The latter are incommensurable with the complexity of the
self-organization found in a cell, just like a quantum computer with a
billion entangled qubits (which does not even exist yet, but may be
realized in the distant future) cannot compare with a computer with a
billion transistors.</p>
<p>If we compare the behavior of a paramecium with that of a robot with
a microchip brain, we can immediately recognize at least seven
monumental differences:</p>
<p>1. A robot is a classical, reductionistic, and permanent organization
made up of separate parts assembled by external agents. A cell is a
quantum and classical organization, holistic, dynamic, and
selfreproducing made of live information (matter, energy, and
information) that moves in and out of its porous and dynamic membrane. A
cell is never the same, instant after instant. This difference is
enormous, because the components of a cell are elementary particles,
atoms, and molecules that behave individually as described by quantum
physics. Therefore, the information processing can be both quantum and
classical.7</p>
<p>2. Robots are deterministic, with the exception of input signals
which may come from the free will of conscious agents interacting with
them. A cell is both deterministic and indeterministic. The
indeterminism derives from the quantum nature of its basic components
and from the creative nature of consciousness and free will that direct
the cell as a unit.</p>
<p>3. Robots are not autonomous and require constant supervision, unless
they perform simple functions. Cells, on the other hand, are autonomous,
capable of dealing with unpredictable situations, including hostile
environments.</p>
<p>4. Each cell of a multicellular organism contains the entire
“blueprint” of the whole. This incredible property does not exist in a
robot.<br />
5. In a robot, information processing and communications are essentially
digital with some analog input-output functions, while in a cell live
information is used.<br />
6. Robots are objective, classical systems without consciousness and
without free will. Cells are both objective and subjective and they have
consciousness and free will, even though they are strongly conditioned
by the laws of physics.<br />
7. A cell has all the classical characteristics of a machine, and in
addition it has the quantum characteristics that come from live
information, consciousness, and free will. In a robot there is no whole,
but only the sum of its classic parts. A cell is connected with a
quantum whole that is more than the sum of its quantum and classical
parts.</p>
<p>In summary, the crucial properties that differentiate a living
organism from a robot equipped with artificial intelligence derive from
the consciousness and free will that communicate with the quantum
portion of its cells (using live information) to determine its overall
behavior.</p>
<p>6 Self-organization is a spontaneous process in which an initially
disordered system creates order starting from local interactions, as
long as there is sufficient energy available. Examples of
selforganization are snowflakes (crystallization of water), certain
chemical oscillations, and heat convection cells in a fluid.<br />
7 The quantum information processing I am referring to here is not the
type we use in the quantum computers currently in development. I believe
there are many quantum properties of atoms and molecules that lend
themselves to analog computations for the moment unexplored and
unknown.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-consciousness-1">The Nature of Consciousness</h1>
<p>Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For
consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in
terms of anything else.</p>
<p>—Erwin Schrödinger</p>
<p>The first time I heard about consciousness was as a child, during the
preparation for my first Holy Communion. Before receiving communion, it
was necessary to make a confession, after an “examination of
conscience.” I didn’t understand what “conscience” meant, but the word
“exam” sounded vaguely threatening, evocative of strict teachers.</p>
<p>However, that first examination was quite easy, because it was
actually done by the priest in our place, for he was the one who
suggested sins to confess, even those we didn’t know were sins. Then, as
I grew up, I started becoming aware of my consciousness. But I never
imagined that I would end up devoting a good part of my life to
examining it!</p>
<h1 id="how-does-consciousness-work">How Does Consciousness Work?</h1>
<p>My first scientific encounter with consciousness took place in 1987
while I was working with artificial neural networks at Synaptics, a
company I had co-founded one year earlier. At that time I was studying
biology and neuroscience to better understand how the brain works. All
neuroscience books described its functioning by reducing it to pure
electrochemical activity, with the assumption, never explicitly stated,
that this activity was identical to our sentient perception. In my way
of thinking the two could not possibly be the same phenomenon. So, I
asked a neuroscience professor who was on our scientific advisory board
to explain how the electrochemical activity of the brain transforms into
our sensations and feelings.</p>
<p>He replied, “Are you talking about consciousness?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know then that “consciousness” was the right word for what I
was struggling to express, but it sounded correct. “Yes,” I replied.
“How does consciousness work and why is this word never mentioned?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry about it,” he said. “It’s something that happens
somehow in the brain—of course—and one day we’ll figure it out.” And
that was the essence of his explanation.</p>
<p>The neuroscientist’s position was entirely consistent with the
materialist assumption that everything that exists must somehow be
produced by the interactions of atoms and molecules. And, since I too
had embraced materialism, his “explanation” seemed rational.</p>
<p>But how does it work? It was not enough to say that consciousness
emerges “somehow” from the activity of the brain. I needed a real
explanation, a mechanism. Then I thought that, if consciousness arises
from a complex information-processing system like the brain, even a
computer could be conscious, at least in principle. With great
curiosity, I began to consider how I could make a conscious computer.
This led me to reflect deeply on the properties of consciousness, and I
soon encountered the great obstacle: the total lack of understanding of
the nature of sensations and feelings, what philosophers call
qualia.</p>
<h1 id="qualia">Qualia</h1>
<p>Our consciousness is the inner semantic space where the signals
coming from the physical world, both inside and outside the body, are
“processed” by the brain and take the form of feelings, sensations, and
meanings, i.e., of qualia. Qualia refer to what “it feels like” when a
sensation or a feeling emerges within our consciousness.</p>
<p>Note that the nature of feelings is completely different from the
nature of physical events. A physical event happens in spacetime and is
accessible “from the outside” through our physical senses and
instruments. This produces a so-called third-person experience shared by
all observers. A feeling is instead a private, first-person experience
accessible only “from the inside” by the owner of consciousness.
However, the interiority I am speaking about is not a physical
dimension.</p>
<p>Let’s consider, for example, how a rose is recognized by its scent. A
rose emits particular molecules with unique three-dimensional
structures. They can enter as “keys” in the “locks” of some receptor
molecules incorporated in the olfactory cell membranes of the nasal
epithelium. When this happens, the receptor cells produce macroscopic
electrical signals. They constitute the input signals to the neural
networks of the olfactory cortex, whose output signals correspond to the
name of the identified object: rose.</p>
<p>Even a machine can recognize a rose by its molecular “emissions,”
emulating the natural process I have just described. However, this
recognition is qualitatively very different from ours: a machine feels
nothing, and the name of the recognized object is just another signal or
symbol. The artificial nose does not have the conscious experience of
the fragrance of the rose. Moreover, the ways in which the machine can
respond to the “rose” signal depend solely on its program. For us,
however, the scent of the rose is not a signal, it is a quale, something
completely different from the electrical signals generated by the neural
networks. It is related to them, of course, but it is not identical, nor
can it be produced directly by them since it has a completely different
quality from the electrical or mechanical activity that characterizes
classical signals. It is a quality that poets have tried in a thousand
ways to express, without ever succeeding.1</p>
<p>The scent of a rose, just like the taste of cherry jam, the sound of
a violin, or the feeling of love is a sensation that makes the one who
proves it consciously aware of symbolic data. It is an experience that
takes place in our consciousness that can deeply affect us. Rainer Maria
Rilke said it best: “There are moments when a rose is more important
than a piece of bread.”</p>
<p>The computer, on the other hand, cannot be aware of anything, nor can
it consciously reason by association about its experience. Therefore,
the comprehension brought by consciousness is not accessible to a
computer.</p>
<p>And herein lies the fundamental limit, and the danger, of artificial
intelligence.</p>
<h1 id="the-hard-problem-of-consciousness">The Hard Problem of
Consciousness</h1>
<p>Consciousness represents the most perplexing problem for the science
of mind. There is nothing that is not known more intimately than
conscious experience, and yet nothing that is more difficult to explain.
In recent times, all mental phenomena have allowed themselves to be
analyzed, but consciousness has stubbornly resisted. Many have tried to
provide explanations, but they always seem not to be up to the mark.</p>
<p>—David Chalmers</p>
<p>This conversion from electrical signals to the scent experience is an
example of the so-called “hard problem of consciousness,” as the
philosopher David Chalmers defined it in 1995 [9]. This problem can be
expressed as follows: what is the phenomenon responsible for our
sensory, bodily, emotional, and mental experience characterized by
qualia? Chalmers wonders: “Why doesn’t all this information processing
proceed ‘in the dark’, devoid of any inner sensation?” Scientists claim
that qualia emerge from the functioning of a complex system, but no one
has been able to come up with a convincing explanation for how this can
happen. That is why Chalmers called it, “the hard problem of
consciousness.”</p>
<p>It is surprising to me that many researchers believe there is not
much to explain. We are so used to being aware that we generally do not
recognize that consciousness cannot possibly emerge from unconscious
matter. Only those who have seriously thought about it have realized
that consciousness is a fundamental unsolved problem with enormous
ontological and epistemological consequences.</p>
<p>For years I unsuccessfully labored to understand how consciousness
could arise from electrical or biochemical signals, and I found that,
invariably, electrical signals can only produce other electrical signals
or other physical consequences such as force or movement, but never
sensations and feelings, which are qualitatively different.</p>
<p>I therefore came to the conclusion that consciousness has to be a
fundamental property like electricity, for example, that cannot arise
from elementary particles devoid of electrical charge and magnetic spin.
In other words, I believe that consciousness must be an irreducible
property of the “elementary particles” of which everything is made, just
as the electrical charge is a property that does not derive from any
simpler properties. If this is the case, then everything in the universe
must be conscious.</p>
<p>This idea is millennia old and is called panpsychism.</p>
<p>Panpsychism, however, has never been taken seriously by science. It
is considered a hypothesis that offers very few opportunities for
falsification. In fact, there does not seem to be any connection between
what we feel and the external world. In short, if for every physical
action there is an explanation that does not require consciousness, what
is consciousness for? This is why consciousness is considered
epiphenomenal, i.e., a phenomenon that passively accompanies another
phenomenon which is the true cause of what we feel.</p>
<p>The alternative is to consider that physical laws may be emergent
properties of consciousness, an assumption that is hard for most
scientists to accept. It would mean that the objective world derives
from the subjective world! And that’s asking too much.</p>
<p>Accepting panpsychism implies that inner reality has a direct impact
on outer reality, a possibility that the determinism of classical
physics denies. No free will is possible in a deterministic universe.
Consequently, our inner reality cannot have any causal power. This is
equivalent to saying that the inner world is completely illusory, i.e.,
inner reality can only be influenced by the outer reality, but not vice
versa. Therefore meaning cannot be ontological in either human beings or
computers.</p>
<p>However, we know that the external world is brought within us through
the processing of sensory information and becomes an inner experience.
If consciousness did not exist, we should not have any experience and we
should not consciously know anything. And yet consciousness is necessary
to know even the most basic thing, like the fact that “I exist.”
Moreover, if there is an influence from the outside to the inside, why
shouldn’t there also be an influence in the other direction? What is the
point of having interiority?</p>
<p>It is peculiar that I know within me that I am conscious, but I
cannot prove it because my inner world is private and cannot be observed
from the outside. I could be a zombie2 claiming to be conscious, and no
measurement could prove otherwise. In fact, I can know the feelings that
another person feels only if he reveals them to me, but even in that
case my knowledge cannot be certain, because that person may be mistaken
or lie to me.</p>
<p>The problem is that a measurement of brain signals can reveal only
some physical correlates of our conscious experience, but not the qualia
that a person actually experiences. Yet the qualia carry the meaning to
the experiencer, but they cannot be measured from the outside. And if I
cannot objectively prove that I am conscious when I know I am, how can I
prove that someone else is conscious?</p>
<h1 id="what-is-consciousness">What Is Consciousness?</h1>
<p>I consider consciousness as fundamental, and matter as a derivative
of consciousness. We cannot go beyond consciousness. Everything we talk
about, everything we consider as existing, requires consciousness. —Max
Planck</p>
<p>Consciousness is that part of us “that lives and feels and turns
itself around,” as Dante Alighieri writes. It allows us to perceive and
understand the meaning of physical reality and of our emotions and
thoughts. It does so through a sentient experience that transcends the
blind translation of meaningless signals into other signals of the same
kind that goes on in our computers.</p>
<p>In the previous example in which a rose was recognized by the type of
molecules emitted, both the computer and the brain could unconsciously
translate the complex signals produced by their respective olfactory
sensors into the symbol corresponding to the name “rose.” But a human
being takes it a step further, because he transforms the objective
meaning of the recognition into the conscious experience of the scent of
the rose that emotionally, cognitively, and associatively connects him
to his entire life experience and produces the subjective meaning he
feels.</p>
<p>This profound transformation takes place within our consciousness. It
has hardly been properly acknowledged by science, and it has never been
explained.</p>
<h1 id="qualia-and-consciousness">Qualia and Consciousness</h1>
<p>How it happens that something as remarkable as a state of
consciousness is the result of stimulation of the nervous tissue is as
inexplicable as the appearance of the Genie in the fable, when Aladdin
rubs the lamp.</p>
<p>—Thomas Henry Huxley, The Elements of Physiology and Hygiene</p>
<p>We experience and know the physical world around us, as well as our
inner world, through qualia. Without them we would be unconscious, like
sleepwalkers or robots. We could still move, but we wouldn’t have any
experience and we wouldn’t even know we exist. If we carefully examine
our inner world, we can recognize four distinct classes of qualia:
physical sensations and feelings; emotions; thoughts; and spiritual
feelings.</p>
<p>The first category concerns the sensations and feelings that derive
from the perception of the physical world, both inside and outside the
body. For example, the taste of food, the scent of a flower, our tactile
sensations, the sound of music, or the sense of color and shape of an
object. This category also includes sensations of physical wellbeing or
pain coming from our physical organs.</p>
<p>The second category concerns emotions such as curiosity, friendship,
compassion, joy, trust, fear, anger, sadness, pride, stubbornness,
shame, envy, greed, confusion, and so on. Emotions feel very different
compared to physical sensations, and apparently they come from a level
of reality independent from the physical world.</p>
<p>The third category is thoughts, although most scholars do not regard
thoughts as qualia. However, if you ask yourself, “How do I know that I
had a thought?”, you may immediately recognize that you perceived the
faint and fleeting “image” of the thought just before you translated it
into mental or spoken words.</p>
<p>For most of us, the translation of that multidimensional image into
words is so fast that we believe we are thinking directly in verbal
form, unaware of the existence of the image-quale that precedes the
symbolic form. That is to say, we are so used to the automatic
reification of thoughts into symbols that we have stopped noticing the
“quale” which is the sentient experience of a thought.3</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth category contains spiritual feelings, which
include the feeling of intense and selfless love, the feeling of oneness
with the universe or with a transcendent presence greater than
ourselves, and the ineffable mystical experiences that have been
reported over the centuries. Spiritual qualia allow us to feel a
profound union with what we experience.</p>
<p>The electrochemical signals produced by our nervous system are
manifestations distinct from the sensations and feelings that allow us
to “live those signals” in the form of sentient experiences, and to
“know the meaning” of that symbolic information. Qualia and
understanding are produced in our consciousness and suggest the
existence of a reality vaster than the unconscious physical reality.
Consciousness defines the inner world of our experience, which is
distinctly different from the physical world of signals that we can
measure with our senses and our instruments.</p>
<p>To avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to emphasize that what I
call inner reality is not the physical reality that exists inside the
human body. Inside our body we can only find physical organs and
electrochemical signals. The “inner reality” of our waking experience
does not exist inside the body but in the same “space” in which our
dreams exist. The physical reality inside our body is still part of
outer reality, even if it is not visible from the outside; it is part of
the symbolic reality.</p>
<p>In other words, our inner reality is not physical in the same sense
that the internal organs of our body are. We imagine that our
“interiority” is inside our body because we believe that only the
physical world of objects in spacetime exists. But this is only because
our sensory-brain system cannot process the type of information that our
consciousness perceives and understands.</p>
<p>Our inner reality defines the semantic aspect of reality, i.e., what
gives meaning and purpose to our life. The semantic reality does not
exist in the same spacetime as physical reality, but in an experiential
space and time closer to the space and time of our dreams or to the
spacetime in which we experience the virtual reality created by a
computer. Such reality exists only as electrical signals in the confined
physical spacetime of the memory of a computer. How come we experience
vast spaces full of people, animals, and objects? Where are those
people? We are the ones giving form and meaning within our consciousness
to those signals, that for the computer are meaningless symbols. The
same phenomenon happens when we translate the printed words in a book
into an inner vivid experience.</p>
<p>Learning, Perception, Comprehension, and Recognition There are
sophisticated neural networks in our brains that are active even before
birth. They allow us to automatically organize and recognize the sensory
stimuli related to taste, smell, touch, sound, and sight as “unconscious
objects.” The self-awareness that perceives, knows, explores, and
interacts with the physical world through the body arises gradually as
our consciousness begins to recognize the signals produced by the body
as qualia in its experiential field, to which it must pay attention.</p>
<p>I think that in an infant the neural networks automatically organize
the sensory information into data-objects which, once unconsciously
recognized, can then be consciously perceived even without knowing their
names and functions. The infant discovers that it can willfully
manipulate certain objects in its field of awareness, while others do
not respond to its will. This essential distinction gradually creates
the sense of self and the sense of the world as non-self. Later, the
child will be able to associate a name with each of the common objects
he already knows because he hears them called by a particular sound. He
will also be able to comprehend their functions by observing who uses
them.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the organization and recognition of the basic patterns
must be an automatic property of the brain that is fairly independent of
consciousness. This is a function similar to the machine learning that
we have recently begun to master using artificial neural networks. My
hypothesis is that this process occurs simultaneously with the creation
of the ego during the first year of life. The ego is that portion of our
consciousness that learns to manipulate the body and the objects of the
outer world by distinguishing what is controllable with free will, and
what is not. When the ego becomes fully identified with the body, as
distinct and separate from the world, the ego is fully formed and the
child thinks of himself as his physical body existing with other objects
and living organisms that are separate and together make up the world in
which he can act.</p>
<p>When our consciousness supervises the learning of the neural networks
of our brain, it allows us to reach levels of competence in perception,
recognition, and understanding that immeasurably exceed the range of
capabilities of our machines.</p>
<p>The failure to recognize the fundamental contributions that
consciousness makes to human intelligence is responsible for attributing
intelligence to machines. Computers are only amplifiers of our
mechanical mental abilities, while the intelligence attributed to
machines is essentially the intelligence of their programmers who
translated their comprehensions into algorithms.</p>
<p>When it comes to true intelligence, it is conscious comprehension
that makes all the difference! And comprehension is a non-algorithmic
property of consciousness that computers can never possess. Computers
are capable of discovering statistical correlations among vast fields of
information because they can perform mathematical operations billions of
times faster than we can. This is a great contribution that AI can make
to society; however, it does not conceptually represent anything
new.</p>
<p>Guided with honesty, integrity, and ethics, AI will allow us to
greatly increase our comprehension of the world, enabling us to control
phenomena out of the reach of our brain as a mechanism. Our real
intelligence, however, comes not from our brain but from our
consciousness. It is our ego’s consciousness that needs to awaken to its
own vaster nature to be able to use AI with wisdom for the common good,
and not to dominate. This point is crucial and must not be
underestimated. President Vladimir Putin said that “the leader in AI
will dominate the world.” But, as Buddha said: “Better than dominion
over all worlds…is taking the first step on the way to awakening.”</p>
<p>When we claim to be conscious, we mean that we have an inner
experience based on sensations and feelings. In this case, the automatic
and unconscious detection of physical signals, followed by their
processing and mechanical recognition, becomes a conscious experience
based on qualia. Conscious perception is therefore the process that
converts the autonomic electromagnetic and electrochemical activities of
the nervous system and body into qualia. The process of “extracting”
meaning from qualia is called comprehension. We comprehend when we get
the meaning conveyed by our qualia perception.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there is a smell of a burning tire in the air.
The first level of meaning you feel in your consciousness is: “there is
something nearby.” Superimposed on this meaning is another more precise
one: “something is burning.” The third level carries an additional
meaning: “the burning thing is rubber,” and finally the burning thing is
“most likely a tire.” This comprehension is therefore enriched by your
subjective experience of past situations in which there were tires
burning. This pyramidal structure is characteristic not only of
comprehension, but possibly also of the neural symbols used to represent
it, although in general we perceive their meaning as a whole, a
“holistic quale.”</p>
<p>Note that the same quale can provide varying amounts of meaning,
depending on the subject’s previous experience and comprehension.
Comprehension is therefore a property fairly independent of perception
and strongly connected with the memory of previous experiences.</p>
<p>Another example is the feeling of love. It is a holistic quale
because its meaning can only be comprehended as a whole, not divisible
into separate parts. This is also why love cannot be described verbally
without always leaving something out. That feeling has a depth and a
dynamism that our words (classical symbols) cannot fully capture, no
matter how good we are.</p>
<p>For example, Edgar Lee Masters in his poem, ‘I have known silence,’
asks: “For the depths / Of what use is language?” And the philosopher
and journalist Umberto Galimberti in The Republic of Women affirms
that:</p>
<p>It is in fact in the nature of a sentiment not to be fully
expressible by the words that name it and, thanks to the insufficiency
of words, the sentiment can let that which is its own transpire: the
inexpressible. The sentiment, in fact, lives precisely in never being
able to tell itself completely, thus in its preservation as a spring of
ulterior meanings.</p>
<p>Comprehending means discovering new meanings within a sentient
experience, i.e., detecting a deeper inner structure within an
experience. Comprehension requires a conscious field of qualia that
defines the semantic space.</p>
<p>Later we will see that the semantic space can be represented by a
complex Hilbert space of which spacetime is a projection. It is
important to underscore that a physical pattern is part of a field of
symbols or signals that exists in spacetime. Therefore, spacetime with
matter-energy is a symbolic space that should not be confused with
semantic space.</p>
<p>Unlike machine learning, which detects the statistical correlations
of symbols existing in a symbolic space, leading to new unconscious
symbols, new comprehensions are about discovering new “connections”
between the meanings that already exist in semantic space. This process
forms new structures of conscious meanings that require new and more
complex symbols to be communicated. This kind of conscious recognition
goes far beyond the capabilities of machines, which are limited to
recognizing symbolic patterns that do not require comprehension. In
fact, automatic learning4 based on artificial neural networks is totally
unconscious. Machines can learn, but they do not consciously perceive
and comprehend the symbols they deal with. They work in the dark because
they are unconscious.</p>
<h1 id="pattern-recognition-versus-comprehension">Pattern Recognition
versus Comprehension</h1>
<p>Learning is the process of acquiring the skills and behaviors
necessary to achieve and improve adaptation to the environment. It can
be automatic or conscious. An example of machine learning is when we
teach a computer to recognize a cup from its visual image. To learn that
task it is necessary to have a representative sample of cup images,
called the training set, and a program performing the simulation of a
properly structured artificial neural network that automatically finds a
hierarchy of common traits (statistical correlations) that are present
in all the cups that are part of the training set. When the program has
learned the correlations existing in the many images whose name is
“cup,” it may also recognize a cup in an image that was not part of the
training set. At this point it seems that the neural network
“understands” what a cup is, even though the “cup” is only another
symbol, not the conscious experience that it is for us.</p>
<p>This ability to generalize is good and necessary, yet the program
still cannot comprehend what “cup” means. In fact, an expert might
create many synthetic images that the computer would mistakenly label as
cups when we would immediately comprehend they are not cups.</p>
<p>As I hypothesized in the previous section, the ability to
automatically form and recognize basic patterns must exist in an infant
before it can develop the conscious perception and discrimination that
can contribute to comprehension. For example, an infant may be able to
consciously recognize an object as a visual “quale” soon after having
automatically learned the correlations necessary to distinguish
“figures” from “ground.” At this point the infant may also try to grab
the object without necessarily knowing its name and function. When it
hears the mother say “cup” while she is holding one in her hand, it
consciously learns to associate the “cup” sound with the visual and
tactile qualities of the object it has already learned. These elementary
forms of comprehension require a much greater capacity for
generalization than is possible with machine learning.</p>
<p>Now suppose the baby sees the mother pour milk into the cup. In this
case it could spontaneously comprehend that the function of the cup is
to contain milk or other liquids. This is a further comprehension, which
requires greater insight or intuition than the previous examples. With
the new comprehension, the child adds another unexpected meaning to
associate with the qualeobject. From that point on, when it sees a cup,
it will also recognize all the meanings associated with it. It is
precisely here that the mystery of comprehension lies, since the
intuitive leaps provided by consciousness go far beyond what can be
achieved with automatic learning.</p>
<p>Whereas artificial neural networks require many examples before being
able to generalize, we can learn to recognize and comprehend consciously
with just one or a few examples, because the intuitive (non-algorithmic)
aspects of consciousness are always operational within us. Our conscious
comprehension effortlessly guides us with such naturalness and ease that
so far we have underestimated its profound power.</p>
<p>Comprehension is like an invention, allowing us to understand
something new and unexpected, thus creating new “common sense”
connections within a complex and dynamic semantic structure.</p>
<p>Comprehension also requires the ability to discriminate, i.e., to
discover subtle differences between experiences that previously seemed
identical. Discrimination allows us to create two related meanings
starting from one. For example, a child can learn that there are two
different types of cups, those with handles and those without, whereas
before she hadn’t noticed since her mother called them both by the same
name. After this conscious distinction, she could then justify having
two different symbols (names) for cups with and without handles.</p>
<p>Comprehension is a process that begins with perception, is followed
by logical reasoning, and is motivated by the desire to know. This
process continues with ever more subtle generalizations and
differentiations. It is the result of our intuitive ability to know,
which is non-algorithmic, and goes far beyond what logic and algorithms
can do.</p>
<p>In a machine, such as, for example, in a logic circuit of a computer,
the correct detection of binary signals at its input mechanically
produces the desired effect at its output (as long as the circuit
works). In this case, the detection and recognition of the input signals
and their transformation into the output signal are “hardwired” into the
permanent structure of that circuit and are taken for granted by the
engineer who created that deterministic (typically many-to-one)
relationship between inputs and output.</p>
<p>In a human being, the detection and low-level recognition of signals
is unconscious, while pattern recognition and action can be both:
unconscious in symbolic spacetime and conscious in semantic space. The
recognition of most patterns and almost all the actions we perform are
automatic, even though they may be part of a conscious experience in
which free will does not intervene to modify these automatic patterns.
In a computer system, however, pattern recognition and actions are
always unconscious and automatic. For example, when we feel an itch and
scratch without noticing, the itch-pattern is recognized mechanically
and is immediately followed by an automatic response (action) previously
learned. In this case, the conscious perception of what we have done may
take place after the action.</p>
<p>If the situation had instead required conscious intervention, the
conscious perception of the pattern would have emerged before the
automatic decision with a sense that a different action involving free
will might be required. The subconscious, in this context, is a state of
consciousness in which we are barely paying attention to what happens in
certain portions of our semantic space because we are focusing on
something else. The crucial point here is that consciousness may behave
like an attentive supervisor who keeps an eye on everything that is
happening but intervenes only when it realizes that the automatic
processes could be inadequate to handle the situation.</p>
<p>The lack of understanding of the nature of consciousness leads to
confusing the semantic space with the symbolic space, thus
underestimating the crucial role played by our free will and
consciousness. Consequently, we have been mistakenly equated with
classical machines despite the unbridgeable difference existing between
us and them. This difference lies precisely in being able to properly
and creatively act with free will based on our conscious comprehension
of a new situation.</p>
<p>In summary, automatic pattern recognition is connected with classical
information in spacetime that must exist prior to our conscious
perception in semantic space. Our conscious comprehension can then
change our response to difficult situations beyond the capabilities of
automatic recognition. Comprehension creates new semantic connections
between qualia in semantic space with the formation of new meanings that
are added to the existing ones. Each new comprehension creates a new
superposition of meanings that are perceived as a well-defined unit in
semantic space. Freewill actions are conscious choices, rather than
automatic behaviors, often overriding learned responses.</p>
<h1 id="is-intelligence-without-consciousness-true-intelligence">Is
Intelligence without Consciousness True Intelligence?</h1>
<p>It takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently.
—Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment</p>
<p>Many researchers believe that consciousness is not necessary to
achieve intelligent behavior. For them, a machine can be as intelligent
or even more intelligent than any human being, with or without
consciousness.</p>
<p>This view is based on an inadequate definition of both intelligence
and reality. True intelligence, in fact, does not consist only in the
ability to calculate and process data, which in many cases machines may
do far better than us, but is much more. True intelligence is not
algorithmic. It is the ability to comprehend, i.e., to go beyond the
immediate meaning of the symbols by including the broader context in
which the symbols are found, thus realizing unsuspected connections
between different fields of knowledge. After all, we are the ones who
have invented computers and algorithms capable of executing tasks
billions of times faster than our brains could.</p>
<p>Our intelligence goes far beyond the limitations of the nervous
system because it originates in a reality vaster than the physical
reality we know, as I will explain later.</p>
<p>True intelligence is intuition, imagination, creativity, ingenuity,
and inventiveness. It is foresight, vision, and wisdom. It is empathy,
compassion, ethics, and love. It is the integration of the intuitive
mind, the empathic heart, and courageous action. In other words, true
intelligence is not separable from the other properties that make us
human and that require consciousness and free will. It is the ability to
comprehend and make unexpected, creative, and ethical decisions.
Machines will never be able to do these things because, if they were as
free as we are, they would be more dangerous than useful. They do work
within limits, but they don’t understand. Our comprehension is not
reducible to an algorithm; it is in fact what can transform a portion of
the non-algorithmic meaning into new symbols, i.e., into algorithms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a human being’s consciousness is fully
identified with the body and with the logical mind, his creative
potential may remain largely untapped and his behavior may become as
mechanical as that of a computer. For example, when a person performs a
religious ritual mechanically, without any comprehension, the outward
behavior may be the same, but the difference between the two is
impassable.</p>
<p>An example of true intelligence is given by creative people with
original and constructive ideas who are capable of transforming them
into new symbolic forms to be communicated to others. Once a new idea
has been translated into appropriate symbols, other people can
understand it through the use of intuition. Intuition is another
conscious human faculty allowing us to easily grasp new concepts.
Computers, on the other hand, can only “learn” new mechanical
correlations, lacking the “common sense” that comes from conscious
comprehension.</p>
<p>In our experience, perception, comprehension, and meaning are so
intertwined in our holistic experience that we normally cannot fully
discriminate their roles. Therefore, when we comprehend something new
for the first time, we often experience a flash of joyful insight that
leads us to cry out, “Ah! Now I get it!” as the new meaning suddenly
appears to us with clarity, superimposed on the same experience as
before but with “new connections” between qualia that radically
transform the whole experience.</p>
<p>Comprehension is therefore the process that adds new meaning to our
experience and skillfully integrates it with the previous meaning. When
this happens, we distinctly feel we have a much greater degree of
mastery than before. The new meaning must then be translated into a new
symbolic form with either a new combination of words or with a new
physical organization of matter, by creating a new diagram or a new
physical model, for example, that makes the new meaning clearer than
what could be achieved with a verbal description.</p>
<p>This translation from meaning to symbols, however, is neither
automatic nor immediate, and generally requires the intervention of
another human faculty: conscious reasoning, which is a logical-symbolic
process rooted in comprehension. After a new comprehension has occurred,
we can later automatically recognize a similar meaning without the
explicit intervention of consciousness. Once the meaning—for example, an
invention—has been expressed symbolically in something that works, it
can be intuitively understood even by people who would not have been
able to arrive at the same invention on their own. Thus, the new symbols
function as “mental enzymes” that lower the barrier to comprehension
that exists in others.</p>
<p>When a computer learns using “unsupervised” learning, and the
programmer insists that the computer “did it all by itself,” that is a
great exaggeration, because the architecture of the program that “learns
by itself” was conceived by humans. If a computer or a robot were left
to operate completely on their own, the results would be very different
and probably catastrophic.</p>
<p>We must be especially mindful about the dangers posed by the human
abuse of computer technology, especially AI, which “will bring to the
fore new dangers that are difficult to predict and avoid,” according to
the Nobel physicist Roger Penrose. There is no doubt that the greatest
danger is represented by the desire for power, domination, possession,
and superiority that dulls human consciousness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the words contained in the final speech of the film
The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin, in which he states that in this
world there is room for everyone and that life can be happy and
magnificent, are still unheeded today. Chaplin denounces human greed as
the cause of the hate that has made us hard, cruel, and has stopped the
machine of abundance. “We think too much and feel too little,” he says,
and “without humanity, goodness, and kindness, life is violence.”</p>
<h1 id="part-two-1">PART TWO</h1>
<p>If you remove consciousness, everything else is nothing for man.
Cicero, De natura deorum, 3.35</p>
<h1 id="a-new-vision-1">A New Vision</h1>
<p>Consider your seed:<br />
you were not made to live like brutes,<br />
but to follow virtue and knowledge.<br />
—Dante Alighieri, Divine Comedy, Hell, Canto XXVI, verses 118–120</p>
<p>Physics is mainly concerned with understanding how the inanimate
world works and provides the premises for all other scientific
disciplines. In the first part of this book I outlined the worldview
based on the typical interpretation of contemporary physicists, and I
highlighted a number of unsolved problems primarily related to the
nature of life, consciousness, and free will. These are subjects
theoretical physicists traditionally consider more philosophical than
scientific and have not yet faced with the logicalmathematical rigor
that distinguishes them.</p>
<p>Such neglect has led to the conviction that the materialistic and
informational view of reality describes all of reality, even though it
excludes its most precious and unknown aspects. In particular, this view
denies—or at best doubts—the existence of free will, and considers
consciousness as a mere epiphenomenon. I also highlighted how the advent
of AI has increased the danger of confusing reality with a theory of
reality that eliminates consciousness, the only phenomenon that makes a
crucial difference between reality and the imitation of it.</p>
<p>The second part of the book deals with the materialistic vision that
justifies selfishness, unbridled competition, and the idea that the
universe is devoid of meaning and purpose, and it explains how quantum
physics does not support this dystopian view at all. I will show that
the existence of interiority can be explained without invalidating the
experimental evidence of physics, since materialism is caused by an
erroneous interpretation of reality based on classical physics. Such a
view has already been falsified by quantum physics.</p>
<p>This new interpretation shows that the difficulty in understanding
the message of quantum physics is mainly due to quantum physics largely
describing the characteristics of the inner rather than those of the
outer world. With this new perspective we can easily understand how
physical reality emerges from interactions between an inner semantic and
an outer symbolic reality that represent two irreducible aspects of the
universe.</p>
<h1 id="existential-questions">Existential Questions</h1>
<p>I remember the starry skies of the past, when light pollution had not
yet veiled and darkened them. In those days when night fell you could
clearly see the Big Dipper with Alcor, Mizar’s weaker twin barely
visible to the naked eye, and the Little Dipper. And, when the sky was
particularly clear, also the entire Milky Way.</p>
<p>As a child, that vastness always filled me with a sense of mystery,
and I felt pervaded by a strong emotion, a wonder that permeated my
soul, though I could not verbalize it. Then, as I grew up, I began to
ask myself the same existential questions that humans have always asked,
trying to find answers through religion, philosophy, art or science.</p>
<h1 id="the-unsolved-problems">The Unsolved Problems</h1>
<p>We can thus summarize the fundamental problems that are still
unanswered as follows:</p>
<p>1. The problem of creation: Why does something exist instead of
nothing? Where does the universe come from? Has it always existed? What
is its purpose?<br />
2. The problem of order: Why is there order instead of chaos in the
universe? How has the universe evolved and why?</p>
<p>3. The problem of life: How did life emerge and why did it
evolve?</p>
<p>4. The problem of consciousness: How did consciousness appear in
living beings, and what is its purpose?<br />
5. The problem of free will: Does free will exist in conscious
organisms? If so, how does it fit with physical laws, and what is its
purpose?</p>
<p>To solve these questions, science starts with the assumption that
there is a unified Field that has all the properties necessary to
transform itself into matter-energy and spacetime as a result of
fundamental and immutable laws that describe the interactions between
the aspects emerging from the Field. The Field is ontological because it
represents the dynamical extra physical “substance” of which everything
that exists and will ever exist is made. It must therefore contain all
the potentials that will produce the properties of the universe that
will emerge in the course of its evolution.</p>
<p>Most physicists would argue that consciousness and free will do not
need to be explained as fundamental phenomena since they are
epiphenomena; therefore these are “soft” problems to which
neuroscientists should find an explanation. Without entering into
territorial disputes, I insist that if these are epiphenomena, they
should then be clearly explained through some mechanism, rather than
arm-waving them away by asserting that at some point these qualities
emerge from the brain. There is too much evidence for their existence
and, moreover, understanding the nature of consciousness and free will
makes all the difference in deciding whether we are machines or not. I
will henceforth assume their existence.</p>
<p>In this evolutionary process we observe four nested levels, each
governed by physical laws: The first level is the emergence of the
inanimate world. The second level is inside the first and is made up of
all living organisms. The third level is inside the second and contains
all conscious entities. Free will is inside the third and constitutes
the fourth level. In other words, living organisms must emerge from
inanimate matter, conscious organisms emerge from unconscious organisms,
and free will emerges from conscious organisms. And a similar structure
also applies to the laws that govern each level.</p>
<p>I think the only problem of the five that can never be solved is the
problem of creation. The beginning of the universe, assuming there was a
beginning, is something that is beyond the reach of our minds, and yet
we need to start with reasonable postulates to explain the other
problems as logical consequences of the only miracle of creation that
must be accepted. As the British philosopher and mathematician Alfred
North Whitehead states: “It is impossible to reflect on time and the
mystery of the creation of the world without an overwhelming awareness
of the limits of human intelligence.” On this topic, Carlos Chagas
Filho, Brazilian medical doctor, biologist, and scientist, states:</p>
<p>I think science is starting to stumble when it comes to what we call
the first cause. The scientist who is sincere and who wants to go to the
bottom of his rationality knows that there is a moment in which he
cannot go further. This is the moment of intertwining between science,
philosophy, and therefore theology.</p>
<p>As for the second problem, that of order, physicists believe it can
be solved by assuming that the inanimate universe evolved according to
immutable laws that describe what happened. Therefore the laws are a
second miracle that is even more problematic than the first because the
nature of laws is completely external to what they regulate. In reality
such laws “command,” because nothing can happen that is not “described”
or “predicted” by them. And mathematics, despite being a product of
human thought, becomes in fact the one that commands and dictates the
laws. But why do these laws exist and not others? How did they emerge?
And, above all, why are they immutable?</p>
<p>Albert Einstein asked himself: “How is it possible that mathematics,
being fundamentally a product of human thought independent of
experience, explains real things so admirably?” And Eugene Wigner
observed that: “The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the
natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious for which
there is no rational explanation.”</p>
<p>Physics still cannot answer these questions. I also note that, to
date, quantum field theory and general relativity have yet to be unified
into a single Field and one universal Law from which the fields and laws
we know are derived. And, in any case, the existence and properties of
the Field and the Law are postulates, that is, plausible hypotheses,
valid only if their predictions are not experimentally falsified.
Therefore, neither the problem of creation nor that of order has been
solved by contemporary physics.</p>
<p>As for the problem of life, it actually consists of two mysteries:
How did inanimate matter self-organize to form the first living cell out
of which the entire ecosystem emerged? And, how did cells manage to
self-organize into a variety of multicellular organisms of unbelievable
complexity? I point out that, in both cases, life went in strong
countertendency to the disorder that is evident in the inanimate world,
as consecrated by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This famous law
states that the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease; it
remains the same if the transformations are reversible and increases if
the transformations are irreversible. Since entropy is interpreted as
the degree of disorder, we can conclude that an isolated system out of
thermal equilibrium evolves by increasing its disorder until it reaches
thermal equilibrium, after which the entropy of the system does not
change. Life clearly does not behave this way.</p>
<p>As for the origin of the first cell (called LUCA for Last Universal
Common Ancestor), no scientist has ever been able to explain how it was
created by natural processes. In fact, affirming that LUCA
self-organized based on the action of physical laws on inert matter is
saying that life spontaneously emerged from non-life. The proponents of
the self-assembly of LUCA have only shown that natural phenomena can
produce simple organic molecules. These molecules are of an
infinitesimal complexity compared to that found inside the simplest
bacteria. It is not far-fetched to say that the self-assembly of LUCA as
a self-reproducing system required a third miracle!</p>
<p>The evolution of life from LUCA to Homo sapiens was instead partially
resolved by neo-Darwinism, even though many gaps remain and not everyone
agrees on the details of this theory. Neo-Darwinism asserts that the
principle of “survival of the fittest,” based on the random variation
and natural selection of genomic traits, called genes, can explain the
entire evolution of the ecosystem, starting from the existence of LUCA.
In other words, the fittest members of the species survive and can pass
on their beneficial genes to their offspring. This “blind” process is
supposed to explain both the natural evolution of the members of any
species as well as the emergence of new species.</p>
<p>While I believe that neo-Darwinism is at least plausible when used to
explain the evolution of species after LUCA’s emergence, I find it hard
to believe that consciousness and free will could emerge from organisms
that are devoid of them. In fact, between unconsciousness and
consciousness there is a qualitative leap so gigantic that it cannot be
bridged by the gradualism of neo-Darwinism, especially in a world that
is fundamentally quantum.</p>
<p>For example, the electrical charge of an electron is a granular
property that has the same value for all electrons. An electron with an
arbitrarily small electrical charge does not exist. Protons have exactly
the same quantum of charge as electrons but with a positive rather than
a negative sign. The electrical charge of any macroscopic body is
therefore an integer multiple of that minimum “quantum of charge.”
Hence, for consciousness to emerge from inanimate matter, a minimum
“quantum of consciousness” should also exist in at least one of the
elementary particles of which the atoms are made. Unless we accept this
panpsychist hypothesis or some other explanation, the leap from
unconsciousness to consciousness requires a fourth miracle. As Isaac
Bashevis Singer observes: “Materialist thinkers have attributed more
miracles, improbable coincidences, and wonders to the blind mechanism of
evolution than any theologians in the world have ever been able to
attribute to God.”</p>
<p>As for free will, it seems to counter the existence of immutable
laws— the starting point of any physical theory—so much so that most
physicists believe it does not exist. And this makes the fifth problem
particularly thorny. Moreover, if free will were not necessary for the
evolution of life and consciousness, why should it then exist in human
beings? All this clashes with the strong sense we feel that we possess
free will, even though it is heavily constrained by physical laws.</p>
<h1 id="the-need-for-a-new-paradigm">The Need for a New Paradigm</h1>
<p>A very large vision is necessary, and the man who experiences it must
follow it as the eagle seeks the deepest blue of the sky. Crazy Horse,
Sioux chief</p>
<p>We have said that physics solves the problem of creation by
postulating the existence of a Field with all the properties necessary
to transform itself into matter-energy and spacetime as a result of a
fundamental Law, also postulated, which describes the interactions
between the emergent “parts” of the Field. In this manner, the problem
of order is solved through a Law, which is the second miracle.</p>
<p>According to quantum physics, the Field is ontological, and the
immutable Law describes the dynamism inherent in the interacting parts.
Thus, the Law regulates the four nested levels described earlier, i.e.,
inanimate matter, living organisms, conscious organisms, and conscious
organisms with free will, by specializing into a number of derivative
laws valid under increasingly restrictive conditions. Despite all the
recent scientific advances, however, we have not been able to eliminate
the need for the four miracles described above. Moreover, physics is
still not unified.</p>
<p>I think that to be able to unify physics, we must abandon the current
approach and open ourselves to a new vision. New concepts are needed
which can only spring from a fundamentally different conception of Field
and Law than the materialist presumptions. I believe that if we started
with consciousness and free will as properties of the Field, one could
postulate only the miracle of creation, eliminating the other four that
could then be logically explained starting from that single
postulate.</p>
<p>In fact, from the logical point of view, how could free will,
consciousness, and life be nested subsets of inanimate matter? It seems
obvious to me that freedom cannot emerge as a special case of
non-freedom, consciousness cannot emerge from non-consciousness, and,
likewise, life cannot emerge from non-life. It is illogical to think
that a more general property could emerge from a property that does not
contain it. For example, how could free will emerge from determinism?
If, on the other hand, the more general behavior were free, one could
explain mechanical behavior as a special case of free behavior.</p>
<p>In trying to explain life and consciousness as classical phenomena,
we hit a dead end. We need to back off and seriously consider that the
classical physical reality may emerge from a deeper and hitherto
unsuspected reality. Otherwise we will never get out of this impasse. If
we really want to understand how the universe works, we have to stop
using the term “illusory properties” for what distinguishes us from
inanimate matter. This is a “crime against humanity,” which must be
recognized, faced, and solved, because it leads to the elimination of
human values, not because we have proved their absence, but because we
have dogmatically decided that it must be so.</p>
<p>In an interview on 16 March 2011 that appeared in New Scientist
entitled ‘The Mathematics of Being Nice,’ Martin Nowak, Austrian
professor of mathematical biology, observes that:</p>
<p>When we look at the mathematical models of the evolution of
cooperation, we find that winning strategies must be generosity, hope,
and forgiveness. Now, for the first time, we can see these ideas in
mathematical terms. Who would have thought that it could be
mathematically shown that, in a world where everyone thinks of
themselves, the winning strategy is to be lenient, and that those who
cannot forgive will never win?</p>
<p>And Italian theoretical physicist Emilio Del Giudice, in the
conference ‘Quantum Physics: The Concept of Resonance’ (11 June 2012),
states that:</p>
<p>Modern quantum physics provides an objective model to understand what
humanity had clearly seen from the very beginning and that modern
“civilization” founded on competition, on the will to be superior to all
others, and on the incessant effort to see their “merit” recognized,
tried to suppress. Life is founded on coherence, on the resonance of the
different, and on the desire of each one to resonate with as many others
as possible.</p>
<p>Not admitting the fundamental existence of consciousness and free
will is a psychological problem, not a logical one, especially given
that to explain the properties of atoms and molecules requires quantum
physics. In other words, the atoms we know can only exist if they are
describable by probabilistic laws and by quantum states that are not
knowable! These are the “pure states” of quantum physics,1 states that
cannot be cloned, i.e., cannot be copied and therefore known “from the
outside,” because any attempt to know them by making a measurement
changes them. This property does not exist in the classical world that
informs our worldview, even though classical physics emerges as a
special case of quantum physics.</p>
<p>The QIP Theory: Consciousness Is a Quantum Phenomenon As I have
already described in Silicon [1] and in the Introduction to this book,
my “awakening experience” irreversibly changed my perspective and
redirected the course of my scientific research toward the study of
consciousness. However, finding collaborators interested in this new
field was not easy. My many and various extraordinary experiences of
consciousness indicated that reality must have both a semantic and a
symbolic aspect, i.e., information could not be separated from its
meaning as Shannon had conceived. Meaning and symbols had to be aspects
of a more fundamental reality somehow.</p>
<p>I also felt that the solution to the “hard problem of consciousness”
was hiding within quantum physics. Therefore, I began to look into
quantum information and into proposed theories in which physical reality
could derive from such information. This is how I came across the
Operational Probabilistic Theory (OPT) that G.M. D’Ariano and his
collaborators had developed in the last 20 years [7]. OPT showed that
quantum physics can logically derive from quantum information. That was
precisely the jigsaw piece I had been looking for!</p>
<p>However, quantum information is completely abstract, i.e., devoid of
any meaning. If consciousness is fundamental, information without
meaning makes no sense at all. And this essential aspect was missing
from D’Ariano’s theory. In my model, conscious experience had to be
another irreducible aspect of quantum information. After we discussed
this point together for a few years, D’Ariano finally realized that
qualia could be interpreted as “the experience of a quantum system that
is in a pure quantum state.” We finally had found the precise connection
between my intuitive model, based on actual experiences of
consciousness, and quantum information, of which D’Ariano is a world
expert.</p>
<p>This theory is called Quantum Information-based Panpsychism (QIP) and
has been recently published [10]. A pure quantum state is a well-defined
state that is not clonable and therefore has all the extraordinary
properties of a conscious experience, which is also definite and
private. Thus, a pure state is only knowable “from the inside” by the
system that is in that state, exactly like it is in our experience. In
other terms, the phenomenology of a conscious experience is exactly that
of a pure quantum state, making such states the ideal mathematical
representation of qualia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a quantum system interacts with a measurement
system, we can only observe an event that can be described by classical
information, i.e., information that can be shared with other observers
“from the outside.”</p>
<p>We will see later that to properly describe consciousness and free
will with adequate mathematical concepts will require the extraordinary
and disconcerting properties of quantum entanglement. Quantum
entanglement (see Glossary) has brought to light the existence of a
phenomenon at the limit of human logic, without, however, producing
contradictions. It took 80 years of theoretical and experimental efforts
to understand entanglement, though it still remains suspended in an
uneasy conceptual fog that no one has yet been able to completely
dissipate.</p>
<p>Classical systems like computers use statistical properties of
collections of atoms and molecules that in first approximation behave
deterministically.2 Therefore they cannot have free will or be
conscious. In fact, if classical information were suitable to describe a
conscious experience, the experience would lack the crucial property of
being private since it could be copied into the memory of many
computers. Physical reality is both classical and quantum, a necessary
coexistence to produce the extraordinary chemical properties of
matter.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that saying that a conscious experience
can be represented by a pure state does not describe the experience
itself. If it did, a pure state would be reproducible. Non-clonability
expresses the existence of something private, inviolate, that can only
be known by the system itself and by no one else. In other words, though
I can represent the love I feel for my son with a pure quantum state—a
quantum symbol—the meaning of that symbol can only be known by me, for
the mathematical symbol cannot describe what I feel.</p>
<p>The fact that a pure state cannot be reproduced makes it homomorphic
to the qualia I feel, for I too cannot fully describe my love without
violating the no-cloning theorem. I can only partially express my love
with words, or with other classical symbols, but that partial
description cannot be confused with the love I feel within myself.
Moreover, for the symbols to be understood, the receiver must comprehend
my words. It should not be surprising then that comprehension requires a
transformation from live to quantum information within a conscious
entity.</p>
<p>Therefore, a pure quantum state is the mathematical entity most
suitable to represent an experience because it has the extraordinary
property of being irreproducible, yet knowable by the system “feeling
it.” Thus, quantum physics, which supervenes on quantum information,
indicates that the ultimate ontology resides in the private experience
representable by quantum information. This is as far as mathematics can
go to describe reality. True knowing is non-algorithmic, and only
partially shareable with classical symbols, i.e. with algorithms. Said
differently, conscious experience is nonalgorithmic because it cannot be
known through algorithms but only by “experiencing” what is known.</p>
<p>Written and spoken words provide a good analogy (though still
inadequate) to better understand the differences between classical and
quantum symbols. Spoken symbols are dynamic and can be described with
sound waves.3 Written symbols are static and can be used to store
dynamic symbols in a book or in computer memory. However, written
symbols contain much less information than spoken ones, because they
lack aspects, such as prosody and facial grimaces, capable of better
expressing one’s feelings. Nevertheless, a conscious experience is
infinitely richer than what a spoken sentence can express, and that in
turn is much richer than what can be conveyed with written symbols.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-term-seity">A New Term: Seity</h1>
<p>We have asserted that semantic reality can be represented with
quantum symbols (pure states) that are more homomorphic to the
experience than classical symbols. Pure quantum states cannot be
duplicated, unlike spoken words, which, though undulatory, can be copied
by a digital tape recorder. Any attempt to copy a pure state would
change it and reduce it to classical information. In that case, the best
that could be done is to convert each qubit of the pure state into a
classical bit. This is in fact what Holevo’s theorem has shown, i.e.,
that the maximum obtainable information from a quantum state is one
classical bit for each qubit of the state. Thus, an experience whose
abstract representation requires N qubits (each qubit represents an
infinity of states) will at most convey N bits of classical information
when it is converted into shareable information.</p>
<p>This is why an appropriate theory of consciousness must use quantum
information to represent conscious experiences. But a theory of
experience should not be confused with the experience itself, just like
the photograph of a person should not be confused with the actual person
it represents.4 Claiming that a pure quantum state is experienced, and
thus known by the system that supports it, gives us a strong reason to
also claim that quantum states refer to something that actually exists,
rather than simply being an abstract mathematical description that helps
us calculate the events we can measure.</p>
<p>If a computer repeats like a tape recorder the same words I use to
describe the love I feel, it would have my same outer behavior, but
without any inner experience which is the miracle of life. Herein lies
the fundamental difference between a classical computer and a conscious
quantum entity. The conscious entity can be represented as a quantum
system, but it cannot physically exist in spacetime. Only the
ontological quantum entity can know its state “from within,” but it can
only translate a portion of its knowing into live information to
communicate it to a living organism, which in turn transforms it into
classical information. I stress again that a living organism is a
quantum-classical system, not a classical system like a computer.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that spacetime does not exist as we imagine it,
but instead corresponds to how our embodied consciousness perceives the
vaster reality in which it exists when such reality is perceived through
the reductive sensory-brain system of the body. In this interpretation,
spacetime would be a projection of the experience of the conscious
entity of the live symbols produced by the body into a subspace of
Hilbert’s space.</p>
<p>A conscious being is therefore represented by a quantum system that
is in a pure state. If such an entity can transform its own state by
maintaining its purity and can create a classical memory of its
experience, we have defined a special quantum system which I call
seity.</p>
<p>“Seity” is a rarely used English word which means selfhood, personal
identity. In the context of QIP, a seity is defined as a self-conscious
entity that can act with free will. A seity is endowed with a unique and
permanent identity because she knows that the conscious experience she
is having is her own, and thus she can direct her experience. Being
self-conscious is much more than being conscious without identity.
Quantum entities that are conscious but not self-conscious I call
thoughtforms. Thoughtforms do not know that their experience is their
own, and thus could not direct their own actions and experience with
free will.</p>
<p>A seity is a field in a pure state existing in a vaster reality than
the physical world that contains the body. A seity exists even without a
physical body, and this is a crucial statement, because it means that
our existence does not depend on the body’s existence. The body simply
allows the seity to perceive and operate in the physical world which is
only a small portion of the vaster reality in which she exists.</p>
<p>A similar situation could be that of a miner robot that transmits all
the visual and auditory information of the mine to a faraway human being
who controls its overall operation. The robot is described by classical
physics, the human body is described by both quantum and classical
physics, and the experience of the mine based on the data sent by the
robot exists only in the consciousness of the seity that controls the
human body. The experience of the seity can only be represented by
quantum information but not described by it, since quantum information
is not reproducible. Only the seity having the experience can give a
partial account of its own experience using classical (shareable)
information.</p>
<p>While the body is representable with the matter-energy that exists in
spacetime
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mi></mi><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{3+1}</annotation></semantics></math>
dimensions), the seity transcends this type of matter. The physical
world as currently understood represents a
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3{+}1</annotation></semantics></math>
dimensional projection of a quantum reality that has many more
dimensions than spacetime. The reality described by classical physics,
compared with quantum reality, is a bit like a film with
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2{+}1</annotation></semantics></math>
dimensions which is a projection of a reality with

dimensions.</p>
<p>A seity cannot exist in the spacetime where our body exists. However,
she can communicate with a body using live information, just like our
body can communicate using classical information with a robot or with an
avatar in a virtual reality.</p>
<h1 id="the-seity-is-quantum">The Seity Is Quantum</h1>
<p>In principle, a seity could be described with a set of quantum
equations, which, however, could not represent her inner experience made
up of qualia, and only knowable from within by her and her alone.
Therefore, a mathematical theory of reality can never fully describe the
ultimate reality of conscious experiences. Moreover, free will implies
creative choices from within that cannot be determined by any algorithm
or mathematics, but only represented a posteriori. Experience is not a
mathematical formula, and even less, a simulation of a mathematical
formula. It can only be known by “living it” on a first-person
basis!</p>
<p>In the quantum reality—vaster than classical reality—each seity has a
different point of view and chooses with free will which classical
symbols to observe and which inner meaning to convert into classical
symbols to be communicated. Thus, each subjective experience is
different. This applies also to the objective description of classical
reality, because each observer has its own frame of reference, and, if
the frame changes, the description also changes. Special and general
relativity have clearly demonstrated this fact. There is no privileged
point of view that can describe all of reality “from the outside” in an
objective way, because each observer is also part of what is observed
and can only have one point of view.</p>
<p>Recall that according to special relativity, two observers, Alice and
Bob, who move with uniform relative velocity comparable to the speed of
light, have contradictory experiences because in their individual
reference frames everything works like before, but Bob discovers that
time passes more slowly in Alice’s world than in his own. In turn, Alice
discovers that time passes more slowly in Bob’s world than in her own.
Who is right? Welcome to the world of relativity!</p>
<p>In the context of QIP we say that a system in a pure state is in an
ontic state, which can only be known in the form of qualia “from
within.” The state of an external observer of the system is instead in
an epistemic state, because “from the outside” the observer could only
deduce the probabilities of all the states that might manifest. The
epistemic state is described in quantum physics as a mixed state, unlike
the pure state which is a definite state. However, the actual state that
will manifest is not predictable by the outer observer, for he can only
know the probabilities of all the possible states that might manifest.
In reality only one of those states will show up, but quantum theory
cannot tell us which one. This type of indeterminism is different from
Heisenberg’s indeterminism and clearly spells out the epistemic nature
of quantum physics compared to the presumed6 ontic nature of classical
physics that can tell us exactly the next state that we will
measure.</p>
<p>The measurement made by an observer in a epistemic state could only
yield a small portion of the ontic state of the seity. As an analogy,
imagine that the experience of the seity is the color turquoise. This
color can be represented by mixing precise amounts of the colors red,
blue, and green. An observer of the entity could only know the
probabilities of measuring one of the three states that correspond to
the red, blue, and green colors. To know the percentages of the three
colors, one would have to make multiple measurements of the same entity,
but when a measurement is made, the state of the entity will be
disturbed in an unpredictable way; therefore, a moment later, the entity
will be found in a new state. This behavior is what ensures the privacy
of the experience.</p>
<p>Quantum physics therefore primarily describes the semantic,
subjective, and private properties of reality out of which the symbolic,
objective, and public aspects of reality emerge! This is strange only
because we thought quantum physics described the outer world. I think
that when we fully realize this fundamental fact, quantum physics will
cease to be incomprehensible!</p>
<h1 id="the-existence-of-free-will">The Existence of Free Will</h1>
<p>Life is like a card game: the hand you are dealt represents
determinism;<br />
the way you play is free will.</p>
<p>Sri Jawaharlal Nehru</p>
<p>I think that to answer the questions posed at the beginning of this
chapter, we must start from a new postulate, i.e., from the hypothesis
that the holistic</p>
<p>Whole contains not only the seeds of the inanimate universe but also
those of free will, consciousness, and life. This is the first miracle
we must accept and, in this framework, it is also the only one.</p>
<p>I call this Whole, One, to distinguish it from the unified field of
physics, because from One emerge the conscious fields with free will,
the elementary seities that I call consciousness units (CUs), rather
than the inanimate fields of the elementary particles of physics that
interact in accordance with preestablished laws. In this new conception,
the CUs communicate with each other, and from their interactions emerge
both the laws of physics and new fields (higher-order seities) that are
quantum combinations of CUs like atoms are combinations of elementary
particles. In the remainder of the book I will use the word “seity” to
indicate either a CU or a combination of CUs, and reserve the word CU to
indicate an elementary seity.</p>
<p>Starting with seities constitutes a monumental difference from the
standard description of contemporary physics in which the emergence of
consciousness and free will has been placed many billions of years after
the Big Bang rather than at the beginning of the universe. In this
manner, from cocreators of the physical universe and life, we have been
relegated to the meaningless effects of some algorithm, soon to be
forgotten with the death of our bodies.</p>
<p>I believe instead that we are seities who temporarily “inhabit” our
bodies. We are eternal, conscious beings rather than perishable bodies.
And we are here to learn crucial aspects of ourselves by interacting
with each other in the physical universe that we have cocreated for this
very purpose.</p>
<p>Everything we perceive in the universe was initially envisioned in
the consciousness of the seities because classical reality follows
quantum reality, not vice versa. And quantum physics follows quantum
information, which in turn represents the thoughts, desires, and
concious experiences of the seities.</p>
<p>This new starting point can also solve the problem of order (the
second miracle of physics), because the laws of physics must emerge from
the core properties of One, which include consciousness, free will, and
the creation of the CUs. Thus, we can eliminate all other miracles from
physics.</p>
<p>The existence of free will requires that physical laws emerge from
the agreements between the seities that communicate with each other. In
this new interpretation, the physical laws can be conceived as the
syntactical laws of the languages that the seities have spontaneously
developed in their communications. The analogy with human languages is
surprising! Our languages have gradually evolved the symbols, the
symbols of symbols, and their rules, starting from elementary
vibrations, i.e., the phonemes that are analogous to the elementary
particles. The communicating seities, therefore, “obey” the syntactical
laws not because they are forced to do so, but because they want to
communicate, and to communicate they must follow the rules of the common
languages they have jointly created.</p>
<p>Such laws become a constraint on free will, but their presence does
not contradict the existence of free will, for without free will it
would have been impossible to make the agreements that gave birth to
those laws. According to this conceptual framework, the laws emerge
spontaneously, like when, as children, we invented games and then had to
submit to the rules we had freely established. The need to obey the
rules does not contradict the presence of free will, since the rules
were designed to leave room for the creative freewill decisions of the
participants.</p>
<p>Note also that the existence of free will requires the extraordinary
property of quantum entanglement which makes it possible to have a
becoming universe whose future is not determined a priori by laws, but
by the free will and creativity of the interacting seities. Within QIP,
the free will of each seity can cause quantum-to-classical and
classical-to-quantum transformations that maintain the purity of their
state. Viewed by an external observer, these are irreversible
probabilistic transformations unspecified by the theory. These have been
called the collapse of the wave function.</p>
<p>Entanglement produces instantaneous nonlocal correlations between two
distant entangled systems such that no signal traveling at the speed of
light could cause them. These acausal correlations demonstrate that,
before a measurement, we cannot attribute preexisting objective values
to the systems’ variables. It is as if the two systems were connected
“from within.” And this happens regardless of their distance. There is
no “local realistic” explanation for entanglement.</p>
<p>Therefore, the nature of the probability used in quantum physics is
very different from the one used in classical physics. Classical
probability represents the lack of knowledge of a classical state that
already exists because it has probability 1 of occurring. Quantum
probability describes instead the probability of a state that does not
yet exist prior to the measurement because it is due to the free-will
choice of a seity. This is the deep reason why no algorithm can
determine which state will manifest, and also why quantum randomness
cannot be algorithmic.</p>
<p>Not even One can know the state that will show up, unless it has
probability 1 of manifesting. Only the syntactical laws agreed by the
seities can predict which events will happen with certainty.</p>
<p>Since entangled quantum systems exhibit nonlocal correlations,
quantum entanglement provides the conclusive proof that classical states
cannot exist prior to the quantum transformations that will manifest
them. This is exactly the necessary condition for the existence of free
will! Therefore, the universe described by quantum physics must be open,
not fully determined
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math>
priori by preexisting laws. If we take seriously the properties of
quantum information, the universe is creatively and unpredictably
becoming, contrary to what classical physics claims.</p>
<p>For those who believe that the macroscopic long-term future of the
universe is predictable because at that scale the universe is
deterministic, I have a surprise. The universe is actually a chaotic
system in which, if we make a tiny change in the initial conditions, the
future behavior can be completely different than the predicted behavior.
Therefore, determinism does not imply predictability even in a classical
system.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that classical systems cannot have free will,
unless they are controlled by entities that have it. Moreover, free will
requires a self-conscious entity like a seity that knows what she wants.
Only quantum systems can have non-algorithmic randomness represented by
quantum probability. Classical randomness is algorithmic because it is
described by classical probability. Thus, a classical computer that is
not controlled by an external system cannot make any creative choice of
its own that is not already predetermined by its program.</p>
<p>A computer has no interiority because consciousness and free will are
quantum. In a computer there is no entity independent from its physical
parts that has authority over the parts. There is no real creativity in
a computer because creativity requires non-algorithmic choices that can
only be made by a quantum entity controlling the computer from the
outside. Free will implies choices that are known by the seity that
makes them, but are unknowable to any outside observer prior to their
manifestations in spacetime.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-model-of-reality">A New Model of Reality</h1>
<p>Science progresses through the refutation of existing propositions
and theories, and not through the stubborn defense of them.</p>
<p>—Ralf Dahrendorf</p>
<p>When materialism claims that algorithmic physical reality is all that
exists and that consciousness is epiphenomenal, it not only does
humanity a bad service, but it is actually wrong! It is crucial that
reliable and competent scientists raise their voices to counter such
erroneous notions. Already, an increasing number of researchers are
beginning to wonder about the many overlooked “anomalies” that reveal
deep cracks in what has seemed unassailable principles for so long.
Through these anomalies leaks the light of a reality quite different
from the one envisaged by materialist physics.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many are still fascinated by the atomism of classical
physics, i.e., by the idea that matter is composed of indivisible and
separate elementary units that are objects. With this conception, they
believed that every phenomenon could be explained, when in reality this
idea could not even explain the surprising chemical properties of
matter. It took quantum physics to elucidate chemistry, and this was
only possible because elementary particles are not objects, but states
of quantum fields that are inseparable from the fields and can be
entangled with each other. Entanglement was found to be such a
counterintuitive and “impossible” property that even the most
adventurous physicist couldn’t believe it really existed. It took about
50 years to get the first experimental evidence for entanglement,
obtained by Alain Aspect in 1982, and 30 more years to amass the
incontrovertible experimental evidence that was able to silence all the
objections that many incredulous physicists raised about its
existence.</p>
<p>As Richard Feynman, Nobel laureate in physics, observed in his QED:
The strange theory of light and matter: “From the point of view of
common sense, quantum electrodynamics describes an absurd theory.
However, it is in perfect agreement with the experimental data. I
therefore hope that you will be able to accept Nature for what it is:
absurd.” Still, I believe that the right theory must obviously be in
perfect agreement with the experimental data, but Nature cannot be
absurd. We are the ones who still fail to understand the deeper reasons
for such a strange behavior. How could an absurd Nature have created
living organisms like us?</p>
<p>Materialists consider the laws of classical physics to be reasonable,
yet they do not contemplate that Nature possesses the consciousness and
free will that distinguish us from inert matter. If Nature is
fundamentally conscious and has free will, as I suppose, the basic laws
of physics must be indeterministic and probabilistic, just like the laws
of quantum physics are. The absurdity therefore does not come from
Nature, but from the human prejudice that insists that the fundamental
laws must be deterministic. The quantum fields that have the
extraordinary property of explaining chemistry are drastically different
from the atoms of Democritus that inspired classical physics. Those are
the ones that gave us the materialism and the determinism that still
dominate our Weltanschauung.</p>
<p>It is precisely on the basis of these prejudices that many thinkers
believe that computers will be conscious in the future. Their prediction
is based on two fallacious assumptions: that consciousness emerges from
the brain and that life is a classical phenomenon that can be reproduced
by a computer. Therefore, according to their theories, we are simply the
body, i.e., a deterministic machine because living cells are considered
classical systems rather than quantum-classical. And, when the body
dies, everything fatally ends. If this were the case, our future would
indeed be hopeless.</p>
<p>This dystopian vision is the inevitable consequence of materialist
thinking, which started with inadequate assumptions. It is therefore
necessary to start with new postulates that are consistent with the new
discoveries of quantum physics. We need, in the words of Roger Penrose
in his book The Road to Reality, “new and powerful ideas, which lead us
in significantly different directions from those currently
followed.”</p>
<p>In the model I propose, as I have already anticipated, consciousness,
free will, and Life exist from the very beginning as constitutive
properties of the holistic Whole (One) that also contains other
properties that allowed the evolution of the inanimate universe.
According to this model, the inanimate universe did not come first but
derives from a deeper quantum reality inhabited by seities with
consciousness and free will that communicate meaning with each other.
That process has gradually created a symbolic reality that contains live
and classical information. This symbolic reality is a “physical”
correlate of the ever-increasing self-knowing of the seities that has
given existence to stars, planets, and living organisms when it is
perceived through the quantum-classical information system we call the
human body.</p>
<p>I am convinced that, as soon as we realize that quantum physics does
not describe outer but inner reality, it will cease to be absurd!</p>
<p>I truly hope that science can cure the misunderstandings of science,
and that those who have become trapped in materialism can revise their
beliefs. I also hope that the many non-experts who adhered to classical
thought, trusting qualified scientists, will carefully consider this new
vision that, unlike the classical one, restores the meaning and purpose
that materialism has boldly erased from our universe.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-perspective">A New Perspective</h1>
<p>All things are in the universe and the universe is in all things…in
this way all things come together in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Giordano Bruno, Of the Cause, Principle, and One</p>
<p>According to the current conception of quantum physics, the physical
universe is the result of the collapse of the wave function that
describes the universe in a complex N-dimensional Hilbert space, where N
can be infinite. Until now, Hilbert’s space has been considered an
abstract space, a mathematical idealization devoid of any physical
reality. However, if there wasn’t a vaster reality than the one
manifested in spacetime, it would be impossible to explain how quantum
computers work. Such computers operate at a temperature approaching
absolute zero
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>−</mi><mn>273.15</mn><msup><mspace width="0.222em"></mspace><mo>∘</mo></msup><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(-273.15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C})</annotation></semantics></math>
, which is a necessary condition to maintain the entangled states of the
qubits. However, the parallel computation possible with unitary
transformations of qubits goes well beyond the possibilities of the
matter manifested in spacetime.</p>
<p>This indicates that there must exist a greater reality which is
currently represented mathematically by vectors in Hilbert space. In
this conception, spacetime would correspond to the projection of an
N-dimensional reality into a
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3{+}1</annotation></semantics></math>
dimensional subspace.</p>
<p>In this new model, Hilbert space is the mathematical description of a
vaster reality in which seities and other conscious entities could
exist, and from which the physical reality perceived by our body
emerges. We already know that what is measurable in spacetime is only a
small portion of the greater reality in which quantum states and live
symbols exist.</p>
<p>However, before proceeding any further, I must point out another
fundamental difference between the concepts of Field and One. In the
universe described by physics, there can be no purpose and no meaning,
since its fields are inanimate. On the other hand, if we assume that
consciousness and free will always existed as properties of One, they
must also be present in the quantum fields that emerged from It. If we
say that the Field is also conscious and has free will, then the Field
is another name for One.</p>
<p>There must also be a reason that justifies the presumed existence of
seities, and the most sensible one I can imagine is that One desires to
know Itself. Thus, every new act of self-knowing of One gives existence
to that “portion” of Itself that has known Itself. In other words,
knowing also means bringing into actual existence what is known from a
state of potential existence that contains what is not yet known.
Knowing must therefore be ontological,1 and each new existence, which I
have called seity, will be a part-whole of One with the same desire,
capacity, and freedom to know itself that One has.</p>
<p>Just as One gives new existence to Itself through self-knowing, “the
main task in everyone’s life is to bring himself to light,” as Erich
Fromm said, and this can only happen by knowing oneself. This idea
reflects one of the deepest desires of human nature, recognized since
ancient times. For instance, at the entrance of the Temple of Apollo in
Delphi, 2500 years ago, were inscribed the words “O Man, know yourself,
and you will know the Universe and the Gods.” I believe that, since we
are emanations of One, the profound impulses that drive us to know
ourselves should have their origin in the same yearning One has to know
Itself. In the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, “Knowledge grows to the
same degree as not knowing, or rather the knowledge of not knowing.”</p>
<p>Creation is therefore the manifestation of One’s continuous endeavor
to get to know Itself ever more through the seities. It is important to
emphasize that to know is to love, and to love is to know. “Greater
knowledge is indissolubly linked to love” (Paracelsus). Therefore, the
more self-knowing increases, i.e., true conscious knowing rather than
symbolic knowledge, the more love increases. It can therefore be said
with the English poet Alfred Tennyson that “complete knowledge is
complete love.” As Rossiter W. Raymond states: “Life is eternal and
immortal love; and death is only a horizon; and a horizon is nothing,
except the limit of our gaze.” And for Emily Dickinson:</p>
<p>love is immortality<br />
or rather, it is divine substance. Those who love know no death, because
love makes life reborn in divinity.</p>
<h1 id="the-creative-principle">The Creative Principle</h1>
<p>There is a great mystery in our existence and in our life
experiences, which cannot be explained in materialistic terms. Our
feeling of freedom is not an illusion and the cosmos is not something
that perennially turns without meaning. Our knowledge cannot go beyond
the fact that we are all part of some grand design.</p>
<p>—John Carew Eccles, The Origin of Life</p>
<p>Saying that reality contains consciousness and free will from the
beginning implies the existence of a Creative Principle that gives
purpose, meaning, and direction to the universe. I think this Principle
could be the following: One wants to know Itself to fulfill Itself, and
thus to enjoy and love Its own existence. “All creation exists for the
‘pure joy’ of God. The work of creation was a work of joy, the purpose
of which was to instill more joy into existence” (Matthew Fox, The
Reinvention of Work).</p>
<p>Therefore, consciousness, free will, and life represent the necessary
means, i.e., the properties that One must possess, to know Itself. The
holism and dynamism of the Field with the addition of consciousness,
free will, and the Creative Principle describe the fundamental and
irreducible properties of One. We know that holism is present in both
the quantum fields and the spacetime described by general relativity;
hence, the unification of physics will necessarily have to describe a
holistic, dynamic, and unified field (Field). The dynamism of the Field
leads to the never-ending expansion of the universe we observe. This
requires that the initial “momentum” of the universe be able to
counteract the gravitational force that otherwise would have reduced it
to a black hole.</p>
<p>It follows that there is teleology (finality or purpose) in the
universe, an idea considered unacceptable by many physicists, even
though the principle of least action, which is the basis of the
fundamental equations of quantum physics, is teleological. As we saw in
Chapter 1, the principle of least action leads to the minimization of
action along the trajectory of an object that moves from an initial to a
final position. As the astrophysicist Allan Sandage says:</p>
<p>Materialist reductionist scientists…will never admit a mystery in the
things they see, always postponing from one time to another, waiting for
a reductionist explanation for what is still unknown. But taking this
reductionist belief to the deepest level and to an indefinite time in
the future (and indefinite it will always remain), when “science will
know everything,” is itself an act of faith, which denies that there may
be anything unknown to science, at least in principle.</p>
<h1 id="in-its-image-and-likeness">In Its Image and Likeness</h1>
<p>In a drop of water there is the secret of all the boundless oceans.
—Kahlil Gibran</p>
<p>The only “image and likeness” of One we know is us. If One is the
totality of what exists, both potentially and actually, One is the
creator, the creation, and the beneficiary of Its own creation and
becoming. And the essence of humankind is one of the countless conscious
perspectives through which One knows and realizes Itself.</p>
<p>Each one of us was born from a fertilized egg, a single cell
containing the entire genome of the future mature organism. Through
subsequent reproductions and specializations of the cells, the entire
organism selfassembled, and was born. The organism continued to grow and
develop for another 15 years until reaching about 50 trillion cells at
maturity. Each cell contains a copy of the genome of the fertilized egg,
even though only a small portion of it is expressed. So the “knowledge”
of the whole organism is contained in each cell! We can therefore
properly say that each cell is a partwhole of the organism.2</p>
<p>By analogy, we carry within us the same “genome” of One, just like
each cell of our body carries within itself the symbolic knowledge of
the entire body. Just like each cell of the body is a part-whole of the
body, we are parts-whole of One, which means that One is within us and
we are within One. As the Persian poet Jalal al-Din Rumi says: “You are
not a drop in the ocean. You are the whole ocean in one drop.” And
Indian sage Ramana Maharshi: “Everyone knows that the drop is lost in
the ocean, but few know that the ocean is lost in the drop.”</p>
<p>How can One, the Whole, be inside every portion of itself? This is an
enigma that we find reflected in the mathematics of fractals3 and in the
properties of holograms, in which each portion of the hologram contains
the whole.4 In this new theory, the self-knowing of each seity is
represented by a pure quantum state that is knowable only by the seity
within itself. One has a knowing of Itself that is given by the
superposition of the knowings of all the selves that emerged from It.
This knowing is knowable only by One. “The One is found in the many, and
the many are infinite facets of the One” (Friedrich W.J. Schelling).</p>
<p>Another way to understand the logical necessity of having to create
seities is to recognize that the holism of One requires that every new
selfknowing must be an entity that represents the whole, and yet be
inseparable from the whole. The seities must therefore neither be parts
separated from One, nor be themselves made up of separable parts. This
requires the concept of part-whole, a quantum system that must contain
the essence of One and at the same time have the distinctive perspective
with which One has known all of Itself in that instant.</p>
<p>The self-knowing acquired by One gives life to a seity with its own
characteristics and with a unique identity, which represents the unique
perspective or point of view with which One has known Itself. The new
partwhole can in turn know itself and give existence to other entities
capable of doing the same. This is why reproduction, which is a crucial
property of Life, is a constitutive property of One.</p>
<p>Reproduction in turn creates generations of seities which, by
expanding their knowing of self and world, expand the knowledge of One,
since One cannot be separate from its own emanations. One is the
interiority of all that exists; It is what connects all Its creations
“from within.”</p>
<p>Reproduction can then be explained as the fundamental strategy with
which One, and all the entities that emanate from It, can know
themselves and each other, each with their own unique, indelible, and
unified perspective. In this way, One creates an exponentially growing
number of parts-whole that can never end, because infinity can never be
reached.</p>
<h1 id="communication-between-seities">Communication between
Seities</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter I called an elementary seity, CU. A CU is the
simplest part-whole, i.e., the simplest quantum system that can contain
the essence of the whole, and possess an identity that, once created,
can no longer be extinguished. A CU is like a living cell that
reproduces and combines with other cells to create ever more complex
organisms. The CUs are conscious fields with free-will agency and
identity that communicate with each other to deepen their own
self-knowing. It is important to realize that since each CU is a
part-whole of One, she can only increase her self-knowing by interacting
with the other CUs through symbolic communications. The comprehension of
the symbolic expressions of the different viewpoints of the other CUs
allows each CU to know, with her own viewpoint, the same wholeness of
One that exists in all of them.</p>
<p>Because we communicate all the time, communicating seems such a
simple task that we don’t realize how complex it actually is. To
communicate, CUs must have the ability to sense and recognize the
presence and the identity of the other CUs, i.e., be able to perceive
the wholeness and uniqueness that characterizes each CU by observing
them “from the outside” since their inner experience is private and
inviolate. This uniqueness manifests like a shareable symbol that must
be automatically perceived and understood as such by all CUs. I call it
the “identity symbol” because it is unique and it reliably identifies
each CU when recognized by another CU. The identity symbol can be
understood as the unique name of the CU. I also imagine that each
identity symbol produces within the consciousness of each CU a “sense of
the other” similar to, although different from, the “sense of self” that
each CU automatically perceives within itself.</p>
<p>I also assume that the sensing, perception, and recognition of these
fundamental symbols is innate within each and every CU, and forms the
letters of the universal “alphabet” from which more complex symbols can
be constructed. The live symbols corresponding to the identity symbols
are similar to the “elementary particles” of physics, whereas the qualia
produced by these symbols are based on the native inner palette of
sensations that each CU feels and uses to understand herself and the
other CUs. The sense of self of each CU includes the desire to know
herself and to know the other CUs like a different point of view of
herself by communicating with them using live symbols.</p>
<p>The creation, sensing, perception, and recognition of communication
symbols must be an automatic, constitutive property shared by all CUs,
for it is necessary to fulfill their inherent desire to communicate.
Each CU must also have the capacity to freely select a portion of the
meaning she wants to express and transform it into an adequate live
symbol that can be understood by the other CUs, to the extent that they
already comprehend a similar meaning.</p>
<p>To be able to communicate without a preexisting common language that
would be necessary in order to agree on the meaning of symbols, we must
assume that there is an innate symbol-meaning correspondence for all CUs
and seities. However, the qualia produced by the perception of a
particular symbol may vary for each entity, whereas the meaning revealed
by those qualia depends on the level of comprehension reached by the
entity. With greater comprehension, the meaning of a symbol may
gradually converge towards the same “essence” for all CUs, even though
the qualia may be very different from CU to CU. I imagine the meaning as
a kind of “geometric structure” that can be intuitively comprehended by
all CUs, despite the variations of qualia and viewpoints.</p>
<p>Comprehension allows CUs not only to recognize the meaning carried by
qualia but also to sense the “semantic distance” between the meaning
felt and the full meaning of the symbol. Therefore, what is not yet
comprehended produces the feeling that there is more to know than what
has been recognized.</p>
<p>Through repeated communication cycles, the meaning gets organized
into hierarchical “layers” that coemerge with a combination of CUs
similarly organized into corresponding hierarchical layers of seities.
Since each seity recognizes the presence of some meaning that has yet to
be comprehended, this “knowing that there is something still to be
known” provides the impetus to seek ever-deeper comprehensions in an
endless process. This is just like the familiar feeling we often
perceive that we “know that we don’t know,” which motivates us to find
out what we don’t yet know.</p>
<p>In summary, the CUs that emerge from One are conscious fields with
free-will agency, and identity that deepen their self-knowing by
communicating with each other with live symbols. By combining with each
other, CUs and seities create hierarchical levels of seities and meaning
with the capacity to comprehend ever more complex meaning, reflected in
the ever-increasing complexity of the live symbols they use to
communicate.</p>
<p>Knowing refers to the inner meaning carried by qualia and represented
by pure quantum states. Complexity refers to the outer structure of live
symbols required to encode ever-deeper meanings. In other words, the
meaning and the live symbols that represent it coevolve and create what
we currently recognize as elementary particles, nucleons, atoms,
molecules, macromolecules, … cells, … animals, and so on.</p>

<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math>
priori, independently from what they regulate, and to predict the
behavior of inanimate things. In the proposed model, the laws gradually
and spontaneously emerge from the communication of the seities to
symbolically express the ever-deeper meanings that emerge from within
through the process of conscious comprehension. The deepening of the
meaning then precedes the creation of the evermore complex symbols used
to represent it, in a virtuous and never-ending coevolution. In other
words, the laws that regulate the interactions of symbols are
syntactical laws that spontaneously emerge from the communications of
the seities and partly reflect the inner structure of the meaning the
seities exchange.5</p>
<p>Once established, the syntactical laws describe the behavior of
symbols and reflect the fundamental characteristics of the self-knowing
acquired by the seities. Therefore, the laws of physics that we discover
are the equivalent of the syntactical laws of symbols that the seities
have developed and consolidated in their coevolution. A crucial
consequence of this model is that the physical universe we observe is a
reflection of the symbolic universe that emerges from the communications
of the seities. This is exactly the opposite of the current
interpretation in which life and conscious entities emerged from the
algorithmic interactions of inanimate matter. In this model instead,
life and consciousness did not emerge from inanimate matter; it was the
manifest world that emerged from them. In other words, the physical
universe represents only the dance of symbols used by the seities to
communicate. The seities, however, must exist before the symbols.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, I imagine matter as the ink with which the seities
write their own self-knowing. Said differently, the symbols that
represent the selfknowing of the seities are written with “matter” as
the self-knowing progresses. Deeper down, matter consists only of
abstract forms or symbols. This means that live information may not
exist at all as we are currently imagining.</p>
<p>Living organisms should therefore be interpreted as extremely complex
organizations of live symbols representing the ever-growing self-knowing
of the seities. A living organism is both quantum and classical and can
“host” the consciousness and free will of a quantum seity because the
seity can communicate directly with the body using live information.
Within D’Ariano’s Operational Probabilistic Theory (OPT), the collapse
of the wave function does not exist. Instead, there are irreversible
atomic transformations that transform quantum information (entangled
qubits representing experience or meaning) into live information that
can in turn be represented with classical symbols (bits) [11]. This is
the mechanism by which seities communicate with living organisms by
converting meaning into live information, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The semantic world is represented by quantum information, and the
“collapsed” quantum information in spacetime represents the live
information of which our physical world is made. Live information
includes all the “particles” that manifest in spacetime, including the
virtual particles manifesting in the quantum vacuum that cannot be
measured, though individually and collectively they can influence what
can be measured in spacetime. This is why the physical world and life
are both quantum and classical. Nonetheless, quantum information cannot
be fully expressed in spacetime because it represents the inner world of
experience (meaning) that is not reproducible and is greater than any
live symbol could possible capture. When the live information carried by
many uncorrelated symbols is averaged, live information becomes
classical information.</p>
<p>The world of living organisms is contained in the physical world,
which also contains the much more limited world of computers and robots
which are strictly classical systems. Therefore, living organisms act as
bridges between the quantum world of seities and the classical world of
macroscopic objects and computers. Living organisms controlled by
seities using live information can in turn control robots using
classical information. The seities can then experience the classical
information produced by robots, computers, and the physical world by
having living organisms convert it into live symbols.</p>
<p>Therefore, robots could only act in a non-algorithmic way, as if they
had consciousness and free will, if they were controlled with the
classical information produced by living organisms, which in turn are
controlled by the seities that alone possess the consciousness and free
will necessary to experience and direct their own experience. The
crucial point here is that the experience of the classical world does
not exist “inside” a living organism; it only exists in the interiority
of a seity’s field.</p>
<h1 id="information-is-not-ontology">Information Is Not Ontology</h1>
<p>The informational world in which we live has greatly accentuated the
confusion between inner reality, outer reality, theory of reality, and
simulation of a theory of reality, to the point where the simulation of
a theory of reality is often equated to conscious experience! In my
model, inner reality is the deepest reality of meaning that is
represented by quantum information. Inner reality contains the outer
reality of live information represented by the fundamental shareable
symbols used by the seities to communicate their own meanings. The world
of live information contains, then, also the world of classical
information that contains rocks, computers, and robots.</p>
<p>Live information exists in the vaster reality of the seities. It
includes that portion that manifests in spacetime which includes the
living organisms through which the seities can have an experience in the
“physical world.”</p>
<p>A theory of reality is only a mathematical model of the measurable
events occurring in spacetime. The simulation of a theory of reality is
based on classical bits and is performed by a computer with limited
precision. Therefore, even a classical system, which is generally
non-linear and therefore chaotic, will have a different behavior from
its simulation after a sufficiently long time, due to the uncontrollable
impact of the initial conditions which can only be known with limited
precision. The inner reality of meaning is therefore “three degrees of
separation” away from its simulation.</p>
<p>Thinking that AI is truly intelligent when it can only imitate human
behavior (being devoid of meaning) is a grave misunderstanding similar
to what occurs when a theory of reality is confused with reality.
Reality is alive, existing primarily in the experiential self-knowing of
the seities rather than in the symbols used by them. The current idea of
matter is completely misleading because we have given ontology to
abstract information without meaning, severing meaning from reality.</p>
<p>In this new conception, the ontology is in the meaning that can only
be privately known by seities. Live information is the vastly reduced
representation of the meaning that the seities have chosen to manifest,
of which only that smaller portion that appears as measurable events in
spacetime has been given reality by physicists.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that particles, atoms, and molecules do not
exist as we have imagined them. In fact, we do not yet have a precise
idea of how to describe a particle, since we do not yet fully understand
the phenomenon of entanglement. Moreover, the concept of spacetime
promoted by general relativity (GR) cannot explain entanglement and thus
is incomplete. GR can accurately explain only certain macroscopic
phenomena, but it does so by using approximations of deeper quantum
concepts that are currently elusive. These new ideas are currently
expressed by various theories of quantum gravity presently being
developed.</p>
<p>Live information is precisely that coherent symbolic representation
of meaning that becomes objective and shareable when it appears in
spacetime. However, not all physical quantities of objective reality are
knowable because there are complementary properties that cannot be
simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision (Heisenberg’s
principle). For example, if we want to know precisely the position of a
particle, we cannot simultaneously know its velocity, and vice versa. In
other terms, some of the objective knowledge must remain hidden. This
means that the full impact of any particle on physical reality cannot be
precisely known. Note that if we could know all the information about
reality, reality would be predictable, making free will impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what really exists is the subjective inner meaning
that each seity has of its own state. For example, Alice knows her own
state, but she can only know that portion of Bob’s state (meaning) that
he chooses to express with live information. This information must then
be perceived and translated into the correct meaning by Alice as a
seity, not Alice as a physical body. And the meaning received largely
depends on Alice’s comprehension of the live symbols.</p>
<p>Note that the meaning is communicated through live information, which
may contain much more information than is measurable in spacetime. For
example, the so-called virtual particles represent “fluctuations in the
quantum vacuum,” i.e., live information that cannot be measured directly
but can have an effect on our reality. In other words, the portion of
“matter in spacetime” that we can measure is only a small portion of
what I call live information.</p>
<p>Live information may also be entangled in an unknowable way with
other live information and thus have an unknowable objective impact on
physical reality.</p>
<h1 id="information-is-not-knowing">Information Is Not Knowing</h1>
<p>In the Italian language there is a significant difference in meaning
between conoscere and sapere, two distinct types of knowing, even though
in common usage the two words may often be synonyms. Sapere refers to
symbolic knowledge, while conoscere refers to semantic knowing, i.e.,
getting the meaning of the symbolic information. In English there is
only the verb “to know” which can produce ambiguity with regard to the
intended meaning. To discriminate the two types, I have here
consistently used knowledge and knowing to respectively indicate the
crucially different symbolic and semantic meanings pointed out by the
verb “to know.” Sometimes this crucial distinction may require more
explicit language.</p>
<p>A computer can manipulate symbols without understanding anything,
i.e., it can have knowledge (sapere) but cannot have knowing
(conoscere). We can have both symbolic knowledge and experiential
knowing (comprehension, meaning). Note that information in physics is
only symbolic knowledge without any subjective meaning. That’s fine to
describe computers but not for human beings for whom information without
meaning should not even be called information.</p>
<p>When I tell my child, “I love you with all my soul,” I express a real
feeling, for the love I feel inside of me exists and is alive. When a
robot says, “I love you with all my soul,” it is simply reproducing the
same classical information that I manifested outside of me, without
feeling anything because it is not a quantum system and thus it has no
interiority.</p>
<p>Ontology is present only in the meaning that lives within the
seities, not in the meaningless information that represents the meaning.
Information-as-symbols is created by the seities to communicate
informationas-meaning with each other. Scientists have recognized the
existence of meaning within their experience, but with their intellect
they have separated the symbol from its meaning and have called reality
only the symbolic information. This crucial omission lies with the
scientists, not with reality. To comprehend reality we need both symbols
and meaning! Today science is only about symbols, and spirituality is
about meaning. We need to heal this split that is only a
misunderstanding, or better, a mis-comprehension.</p>
<p>A robot automatically repeats what its human programmer makes it say
because it has no life and no consciousness, even though it moves and
appears to be alive. We instead are alive even when our body is dead. We
exist in a greater reality which also contains what we call physical
reality. And when our bodies die, we don’t die. “Death is the next
rebirth that is given to us as a gift in the spiritual universe” (Bert
Hellinger, Natural Mystic: The path of knowledge).</p>
<p>We, as seities, are eternal.</p>
<p>When the designer of a robot claims that the feeling is identical to
the symbol-for-the-feeling, if he is not in bad faith he is not aware of
what he is saying. As such, he has lost contact with his inner life. A
robot has no feelings. Period. And when we disconnect from our feelings
we will act as robots. The vital difference is that we have the
privilege of being able to behave as sentient beings as well as robots.
That choice is ours and ours alone, and it must come individually
through the free will each of us has.</p>
<p>It is true that feelings may often make us suffer, but choosing not
to feel anything to prevent suffering is senseless. As the German writer
Eckhart Tolle says: “If you had not suffered as you have suffered, you
would not have the depth, the humility, and the compassion of a human
being.” We can know ourselves only by first acknowledging and then by
following our feelings with our reasoning-and-feeling mind. We need
both!</p>
<p>We must not confuse words-as-symbols with the ideas and meaning they
represent. If we fail to comprehend the insurmountable difference
between symbol-without-meaning and symbol-with-meaning, we confuse the
imitation of reality with reality. As Alfred Korzybski states: “The map
is not the territory” and “the word is not the thing…Maps and words,
small geographical maps of our psyche, are used to move in reality, but
if they are too vast they become bulky and dangerous.” In fact, the
symbolic-only representation of reality, however detailed it may be, can
never be reality.</p>
<p>In our study of reality we have fallen into a trap because we have
mistaken the symbol for the meaning! We have given to symbols the value
of reality and denied reality to the meaning. This happened because we
have disconnected from our own feelings, especially when suffering is
present. In fact, refusing to face our suffering will increase it, not
make it disappear. Suffering is what our lack of comprehension feels
like. It can only disappear when it is faced and resolved, not by
pretending it out of existence.</p>
<p>Suffering occurs when we are not heeding the call to know ourselves
with honesty and integrity. By not facing our inner reality of meaning,
we end up living in a virtual reality made only of empty symbols. We may
pretend to be happy for a while, until the suffering becomes so
unbearable that we are forced to “look at our avoidance” and take care
of the real purpose of our existence. Ontology exists only in the
semantic-symbolic reality that cannot be separated.</p>
<p>This core misunderstanding must be healed as soon as possible,
because it is leading us astray. We are conscious and luminous fields,
not machines! The machines are only the symbolic part of Life. The real
information is what allows us to know and appreciate each other as
conscious human beings, as full expressions of One. I hope that the time
will soon come when, as Goethe said: “The inner light will come out of
us, so that we will no longer need any more light.”</p>
<h1 id="a-new-interpretation-of-quantum-information">A New
Interpretation of Quantum Information</h1>
<p>We have seen that quantum information is the representation of
knowing (meaning), but that information is not what knowing is. Knowing
is a lived experience, the conscious experience of a seity that can be
mathematically represented by a pure quantum state described as an
organization of entangled qubits. However, this qubit structure cannot
replace the lived experience which is ontological because the seity that
knows from within becomes what it knows. The description of reality is
not reality; the map is not the territory.</p>
<p>This type of knowing (meaning) is linked to existence like the two
sides of the same coin, because to exist is to know the meaning, and to
know the meaning is to exist. The pure quantum state is just an abstract
state that is useful to represent the knowing of the seity that becomes
what it knows. The interesting aspect of quantum information is that it
has the essential characteristics of what it represents since it is
definite and cannot be reproduced, i.e., it is private just like the
knowing of the seity is. In this sense, quantum information represents
the interiority of the universe! What can only be known by being it.</p>
<p>Whereas classical information is public and can be copied, quantum
information is private and knowable only by the “quantum system,” i.e.,
by the seity. In the interpretation offered by QIP, what can be known of
the private meaning from the outside is only the live symbolic
information that the seity decides to make public. And the comprehension
of the meaning of those symbols requires that the receiving seities
already know a meaning close to what those symbols are intended to
convey.</p>
<p>When we comprehend something new, we create new existence and become
more than what we were before: we grow and achieve great fulfillment
(joy). The urge to grow belongs to life. “Life is growth. If we stop
growing, technically and spiritually, we are theoretically dead”
(Morihei Ueshiba, founder of Aikido).</p>
<p>Any new meaning must first occur within our consciousness and then it
can be communicated by creating new symbols, just as it happens for a
book whose content can only be written after the author has comprehended
what he will symbolically express. Said differently, the meaning
precedes the symbols that describe it, just like the whole-as-idea (the
invention) always comes before its symbolic construction.</p>
<p>If we represent a seity as a quantum system, then her quantum state
represents her inner experience which is an indivisible whole. What can
be manifested of that experience will be that portion of the whole that
the seity has chosen to share with live symbols. Sometimes the seity may
manifest a “creative state” represented by a live symbol that never
existed before, in which case an external observer could not have
assigned a probability prior to measuring it. This situation, however,
could only be represented by quantum theory if the postulate of
unitarity was not part of it, since this postulate implies that all the
possible states that can manifest must be known or knowable before their
manifestation. Therefore unitarity is equivalent to eliminating
creativity and free will from the universe, since a creative state,
prior to its creation for the first time, cannot even be known by its
creator.</p>
<p>D’Ariano has recently shown that the postulate of unitarity is
nonfalsifiable [11]; therefore this postulate should not be part of
quantum physics, thus allowing the existence of creative states that
could either be caused by free-will decisions or by new comprehensions.
Therefore, a more general quantum theory, such as D’Ariano’s OPT [7]
that does not need such a postulate, allows the existence of
irreversible non-unitary transformations7 that avoid the need for the
collapse of the wave function and permit the existence of free will.</p>
<p>There can be no laws or algorithms that forbid the open evolution of
the universe, the becoming of One, which is based on One’s free
exploration of Its self-knowing. Only the probabilities of symbols that
follow consolidated syntactical laws can be predicted, but the emergence
of new symbols and new laws that did not exist before cannot be
predicted.</p>
<h1 id="the-universe-as-exploration-of-knowing">The Universe as
Exploration of Knowing</h1>
<p>I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, And all
I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther

<p>Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,<br />
Outward and outward and forever outward. Walt Whitman, Song of
Myself</p>
<p>In summary, I believe that from the Creative Principle follows the
logical necessity of CUs emerging from One. These are parts-whole whose
purpose is to know themselves, and thus increase the self-knowing of
One. CUs are “perspectives,” “points of view,” or “frames of reference”
with which One knows Itself. They are similar to the monads introduced
in 1720 by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.8 As CUs communicate and know
themselves, they create a first level of symbols and syntactical laws
that eventually lead to a second level of seities and a stable second
level of symbols made of combinations of first-level symbols. For
example, when the CU corresponding to the quantum field of “up” quarks
communicates with the CU that corresponds to the field of “down” quarks,
a new combination-seity whose identity symbol is the proton is
eventually formed. The new symbol is a combination of the original
symbols, but it has very different properties from those of the quarks
that combined. The measurable state of the proton field is only a small
portion of its quantum state, which is not fully knowable from the
outside since it corresponds to the private experience of the new
seity.</p>
<p>This process is repeated and results in the creation of a hierarchy
of levels of seities and symbols. For example, when the “proton” seity
communicates with the “electron” seity, they end up creating a second
level of syntactical laws and a third-level seity whose identity symbol
corresponds to the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>I am describing a process similar to that of the Lambda-CDM
cosmological model,9 but with a fundamental difference because the first
entities that emerge from One are CUs, not the inanimate fields of
elementary particles that follow pre-established laws. In the proposed
model, the unified Field of physics is the physical correlate of One,
the elementary quantum fields are the physical correlates of the CUs,
and the elementary particles in spacetime are the live symbols used by
the CUs to communicate with each other. The basic laws of quantum
physics are the analog of the syntactical laws of symbols that
spontaneously and gradually emerged as the CUs evolved their basic
language.10</p>
<p>For example, the symbols manifested by the seity whose physical
correlate is the quantum field of electrons are the states, entangled or
not, of such a field. These states we called electrons, which were until
recently erroneously considered independent objects. The configuration
of these states represents that portion of the meaning of the “electron
seity” that she communicates symbolically to the other fields. If we
could simultaneously perceive the vast number of states of the electron
field and were able to interpret their meaning, we could understand what
the electron seity is communicating to the other seities.</p>
<p>I like to point out that what we do when we speak is not much
different from what the electron field does: the vibrations we emit are
symbols that represent the meaning we intend to communicate. The
physical laws that describe the behavior of the air vibrations have
little to do with the meaning we communicate, which is what matters to
us. These vibrations are related to the meaning they represent, but they
are not the meaning.</p>
<p>In this model, the syntactical laws of the seities’ languages
correspond to the probabilistic physical laws describing the behavior of
the states of the quantum fields. These states (symbols) are controlled
by the free will of the seities and behave with statistical laws similar
to those of the letters of the alphabet of our languages. In this
interpretation, it is not surprising that the pure quantum states cannot
be copied since they are private, knowable only by the seity, and not by
any outer observer, just like our inner experiences are.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main reason nobody understands quantum physics is
because it describes the inner world of private experience and free
will, when it was expected to describe the behavior of material objects
in spacetime. The quantum formalism is telling us that Nature has a
private interiority which is the source of the public exteriority we
observe. With this elegant interpretation, quantum physics can finally
become comprehensible.</p>
<p>self-knowing) must somehow exist forever, since meaning is the
ultimate ontology.<br />
2 If we analyze the construction of a computer or a robot, we can easily
see that each of their parts is a transistor or a piece of matter that
knows nothing of the whole. Clearly, the claim that a living organism is
like a classical machine cannot be correct.<br />
3 A fractal is a geometric object that appears similar on different
scales in the sense that by enlarging a portion of the object, the same
shape is found in its parts. Surprisingly, these objects can be obtained
with simple, recursive algorithms. A hologram is obtained by dividing a
monochromatic light beam in two. The first beam illuminates the object,
and its reflected light is made to interfere with the second beam on a
photographic plate. By illuminating the photographic plate with
monochromatic light of the same frequency, we get a virtual image of the
object in three dimensions! A remarkable aspect of a hologram is that,
by illuminating only a portion of it, the same virtual object is
reproduced with less detail.<br />
5 This “similarity” or homomorphism between symbols and meaning reminds
one of onomatopoeia, which refers to those words (symbols) whose sound
(meaning) resembles the “sound” produced by the things that the words
are meant to describe.<br />
6 6 There are four aspects of quantum physics that prevent all
information from being known: (1) Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle,
(2) the actual quantum state that will manifest cannot be known, for
only its probability can be known, (3) the quantum state of a system
cannot be reproduced, and (4) the entanglement is nonlocal and is not
generally knowable. Therefore, the state of a system could change
because it is entangled with another system that may have interacted
with a third system far away without any possible knowledge on our part,
even in principle. Unitary transformations have been widely adopted by
physicists following the mathematical theory of quantum physics
developed by von Neumann in the mid-1930s. These transformations are
reversible, maintain the purity of the quantum state, and require the
collapse of the wave function to produce measurable phenomena in
spacetime. The transformations performed by quantum computers, for
example, are strictly unitary. The collapse of the wave function created
the measurement problem that has never been solved.<br />
8 Leibniz proposed that the universe is created by the interactions of
monads in a famous book entitled Lehrsätze über die Monadologie,
published in 1720. Leibniz understood that consciousness must be the
basis of reality and did not approve, on a purely philosophical basis,
of the idea that reality should be controlled by mechanical and coercive
laws as proposed by his contemporary, Newton.<br />
9 In the Lambda-CDM model, the universe contains three components: (1) a
cosmological constant associated with dark energy (lambda), (2) dark
matter called CDM (cold dark matter), and (3) ordinary matter. This is
the simplest model that accounts for the following phenomena: (1) the
cosmic microwave background, (2) the distribution of galaxies, (3) the
relative abundances of hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium, and (4)
the accelerated expansion of the universe.<br />
10 In physics, the laws are independent from the fields and are imposed
“from the outside,” constituting the second “miracle” that has never
been explained. In the new model, the laws emerge through the
spontaneous communications of the CUs. They represent the syntactical
rules that the CUs “negotiated and agreed” in order to communicate with
each other.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-the-seity-1">The Nature of the Seity</h1>
<p>Each of us is a god with the conviction of being contingency, shadow
of a dream.</p>
<p>—Emanuele Severino, ‘A German handed me the machine gun and ran
away,’ Corriere della Sera, 31 December 2018</p>
<p>As Giordano Bruno expressed: “There will come a day when man will
wake up from oblivion and will finally understand who he really is.” I
also believe that we all have a divine nature which is our true essence,
and our task is to try “to bring the divine that is in us back to the
divine that is in the universe” (Plotinus).</p>
<p>We are potentially infinite beings that cannot be completely captured
by any definition, because to define is to limit by placing rigid
boundaries around us. Defining requires attributing certain properties
and excluding others. “Man has no limits and when he realizes it, he
will be free even here, in this world” (Giordano Bruno). Yet many would
like a reality in which everything—including us—can be cataloged,
classified, defined, and placed in a box. That is, they would like
reality to be entirely digital, bounded, in which everything is
reducible to being either true or false. This, however, does not even
work within arithmetic, as we have already pointed out when we discussed
undecidability in axiomatic systems in Chapter 1 in connection with
Gödel’s theorems.</p>
<p>There are many thinkers who would like us to believe that we are just
machines and that it will be possible to create machines that are
smarter than us. However, to become aware of our greatness, we must
reconnect with our deepest feelings which are the source of our personal
power and vastness.</p>
<p>And then we will finally comprehend that if we can create digital
machines that perform certain mechanical tasks much faster than us, and
without making any mistakes, it is only because we are infinitely “more”
than our machines.</p>
<p>We are not digital and finite. We are vastness, potentially beyond
all limits. I know it with certainty in my innermost being because I
have experienced it, as described in the Introduction of this book. But
the description of a pure state with words (shareable symbols) is
impossible because a pure state is not reproducible, and thus words will
never be able to capture the full meaning intimately disclosed by a
sentient experience. We all have already experienced this limitation,
and physics is also telling us this much.</p>
<p>Although this new model is still incomplete in many details, I
believe it is sufficiently fleshed out for the curious reader to begin
grasping the whole vision and to reflect on its deep significance. The
effort needed to see reality with new eyes will lead us to freedom from
the conceptual prison that has broken our wings. “You were born with
ideals and dreams. You were born with a gift. You were born with wings.
You are not meant to crawl, so don’t do it. You have wings, learn to use
them and fly” (Jalal al-Din Rumi).</p>
<h1 id="a-seity-is-beyond">A Seity Is … Beyond</h1>
<p>To define is to limit. Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>In my model, a seity is a reality that goes beyond all categories and
all definitions. A seity cannot be defined in the same way that a
machine can be, since its properties, namely consciousness, identity,
free-will agency, and creativity, are inseparable and do not have sharp
boundaries.1 We have already discovered with quantum physics that
reality goes far beyond the one described by classical physics, though
we are still struggling to understand. “Nobody understands quantum
physics.” This is a famous quote by Richard Feynman, who included
himself in that statement, expressing the strangeness of quantum
physics, for it contradicts our intuitive ideas of how the world
works.</p>
<p>I suspect we don’t understand quantum physics mainly because we don’t
want to accept, at the “psychological level,” what it is telling us, and
we want to continue to believe that the real world is the deterministic
one described by classical physics. Quantum reality is instead
probabilistic, indeterministic, and contains entanglement, a mysterious
property that connects the quantum states (particles) “from within”
regardless of their distance. This implies a holistic reality made of
parts that are not completely separable. Therefore the quantum nature is
already telling us that the determinism and reductionism of classical
physics do not exist, and that free will is possible, starting from the
elementary fields of which everything is made.</p>
<p>It is surprising to me that, instead of embracing the freedom that
quantum physics has shown us to be a crucial feature of reality, most
scientists seem to prefer a deterministic and controllable world in
which all properties can be precisely defined. I believe that we are all
an integral part of a cooperative and magnificent adventure of
consciousness, the aim of which is to discover that each of us has One
within himself and has a special gift that makes him unique and
irreplaceable. This gift is the particular point of view with which One
has known Itself when It gave existence to each one of us. “Each person
is a new experiment in God’s laboratory” (Isaac Bashevis Singer), and,
as Walt Whitman wrote in Leaves of Grass:</p>
<p>Each of us inevitable,<br />
Each of us limitless—each of us with his or her right upon the earth,
Each of us allow’d the eternal purports of the earth,<br />
Each of us here as divinely as any is here.</p>
<p>Moreover, those who appreciate and develop their uniqueness do
experience deep joy, love, and fulfillment in knowing themselves in each
other.</p>
<h1 id="the-creation-of-many-worlds">The Creation of Many Worlds</h1>
<p>Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.
—Walt Whitman, Song of Myself</p>
<p>The seities can create many different worlds which are all
interconnected and exist one inside the other. Their fundamental
connections are determined by the universal language created by the
first-level seities, the CUs. This is the world that contains all other
worlds, the language from which all other languages have emerged, and
through which One can explore every possibility of knowing Itself.</p>
<p>For example, whenever the seities discover undecidable propositions
on the basis of the “axioms” valid in their own world, they can create
two new worlds in addition to the existing one: the first is formed by
the seities who choose to explore the undecidable hypothesis as if it
were true, adding it as a new axiom to the preexisting ones; the second
world contains the seities that choose to explore the undecidable
hypothesis in the negative. Thus, a portion of the seities decides to
reject the undecidable axiom, while two other groups choose to explore
two new and logically far less secure worlds.</p>
<p>A striking example of an undecidable hypothesis is found in Euclidean
geometry when it was discovered that it was impossible to falsify the
axiom of parallels on the basis of the other four axioms. This means
that two new, non-Euclidean geometries could be created in which the
parallel postulate was false. In Riemann’s elliptical geometry the
parallels converge, while in Lobachevsky’s hyperbolic geometry the
parallels diverge. Clearly, certain theorems valid in Euclidean geometry
are not valid in elliptical or in hyperbolic geometry, even though all
the theorems that do not depend on the parallel postulate are valid in
all three geometries.</p>
<p>The seities who decided to reject the new axiom could continue to
explore their world, ignoring the two new worlds being explored by the
more adventurous seities. The repetition of this process, with the
addition of many new undecidable axioms, may eventually lead to the lack
of communication between seities who have created logically incompatible
worlds.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the seities who have not accepted any undecidable axioms
could still benefit from the new knowledge gained by the others. And the
latter could always communicate and understand each other by using only
the basic language common to all of them, a language that continues to
exist and evolve thanks to the less enterprising seities. It is
important to note that the seities who explore these insecure worlds may
lose their connection with the world of fundamental and indisputable
values, because they may not realize how many undecidable axioms they
have taken as true or false.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that, starting from any level, the entities and
the laws of the next level are not fully predictable on the basis of the
knowledge acquired from the entities and laws of the previous levels.
The creative nature of the universe is manifested by the repetition of
the same open process, which subsequently creates a hierarchy of levels
and syntactical laws that describe an unpredictable becoming without
end. The universe is open and its future is undetermined. This is a
consequence of free will and the inherent creativity of One, which also
reveal themselves in the probabilistic laws and in the indeterminism of
the symbolic reality.</p>
<p>At the same time, it must be recognized that free will coexists with
the laws of symbols, and therefore, as new levels of laws are created,
freedom becomes ever more constrained, and this can lead to more
mechanical worlds, even in the type of knowing being explored. Classical
physics describes precisely those worlds that are apparently
mechanical,2 because their objects are statistical combinations of
numerous uncorrelated quantum states. In these worlds, with their
evermore constrained classical symbols, the danger of confusing symbols
and meaning is worsened.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-world-of-seities-work">How Does the World of
Seities Work?</h1>
<p>To get an idea of how this world might work, let’s try to imagine a
large square with hundreds of people and animals that emit perceptible
vibrations like sounds. Vibrations are abstract symbols whereas sounds
are the qualia that bring meaning to each entity (seity). The vibrations
produced by the various participants spread throughout the square and
can be perceived by all present. This creates a “vibration sphere,” an
objective and shared physical reality, in which all the information
produced by the various entities is accessible to each of them.</p>
<p>For example, if we observe Bob and Alice conversing, we know that the
goal of their communications is to exchange meanings using symbols. The
symbols are the vibrations of the air produced by the larynx of one that
are captured by the hearing of the other. Hearing is extremely
sophisticated because it allows the listener to select with free will
certain frequencies and convert them into the symbols of interest, while
ignoring all the others. The free-will selection made is perceived as
qualia and translated into meaning by the listener. In the other
direction, the choice of the meaning to be converted into symbols is
made by the free will of the sender who generates the vibrations
corresponding to the meaning to be transmitted. The symbols that Alice,
Bob, and the other entities in the square transmit to each other become
a portion of the sphere of objective and shared vibrations from which
emerge the subjective experiences of Alice, Bob, and all the others.</p>
<p>Simple actions, like Bob conversing with Alice, involve a very
complex sequence of events. Bob and Alice are seities that send and
receive live symbols through their bodies. When Bob is the sender, he
freely chooses the meaning to convey and creates live symbols to
communicate to the cells of his body. From that moment on, his body
automatically converts those live symbols into the classical symbols
that are the vibrations of the air produced by the complex system of
lungs, larynx, throat, tongue, mouth, and their relative muscular
systems controlled by the brain. These vibrations are the classical
symbols that Bob’s body adds to the vibration sphere.</p>
<p>Alice acts as the receiver and freely chooses to listen to the
vibrations produced by Bob by sending appropriate live symbols to the
cells of her body that control her sophisticated hearing system to
automatically tune into those frequencies that correspond to the
vibrations emitted by Bob’s body. These vibrations are then converted
into classical symbols by Alice’s auditory system and neural networks,
and finally into live symbols within</p>
<p>Alice’s cells, which her consciousness then translates into the
qualia corresponding to the meaning of Bob’s words. This is possible as
long as she already knows the meaning of those live symbols.</p>
<p>The roles of Alice and Bob are then reversed in the next phase of the
communication cycle during which Alice becomes the sender and Bob is the
receiver. The whole cycle then repeats many times until the end of their
communication, when the two take their leave.</p>
<p>In this example, each entity constantly repeats cycles of
communication consisting of observation, experience, and action. Here it
can be clearly seen that the inner semantic reality influences the outer
symbolic reality, and vice versa. It is also evident that the vibrations
emitted represent an influence from the whole to the parts, contrary to
the classical materialist view in which the behavior of the whole is
entirely produced by the behaviors of the parts. In other words, the
movement of the air molecules of the square is also determined by the
choices made by the free will of the communicating seities, and only
secondarily by the elementary particles of their bodies. It should also
be noted that the influences from the inner to the outer world are
denied by classical physics since the existence of consciousness as a
possible cause of physical phenomena is inadmissible.</p>
<p>At each communication cycle, each entity observes only a small
portion of the vibration sphere, ignoring the rest which is considered
background noise. This means that what is signal and what is noise are
determined by the conscious choices of each observer. For example, my
experience while I am talking to Francis will be very different from the
experiences of my neighbors conversing with each other. The sounds made
by them are part of my background noise, while my sounds are part of
their background noise. For the neighboring dog which only pays
attention to the barking of other dogs, all other sounds are background
noise. So the experience of each observer is different and depends on
their decisions about what to perceive, even though the objective
vibration sphere is the same for everyone! Reality is therefore even
more complicated than we have been told.</p>
<p>According to materialists, everything that happens in the physical
world should be “objective.” The idea that there is only one objective
reality is such an extreme prejudice that it should have been abandoned
a long time ago. In fact, quantum physics describes a very different
world, which is also consistent with the existence of consciousness and
free will. We can say that there is no objective reality independent of
consciousness and free will. Instead, there are many overlapping
subjective-objective realities that interact with each other.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could also be said that at each instant there
is only one objective reality, because each seity chooses which portion
of the same reality it wishes to observe. But the free-will decisions
made by the seities about what to observe change reality
non-algorithmically,3 and the free-will decisions of which symbols to
emit likewise transform reality nonalgorithmically, so that, at any
moment, reality can change not only as a result of the laws of symbols
but also due to the subjective and free-will decisions of the seities,
which are not predictable by any laws.</p>
<p>Consequently, the evolution of the “objective” physical universe must
be interpreted as the symbolic correlate of the evolution of the
self-knowing of all the interacting seities. In other words, the
universe that we can objectively observe is only the symbolic portion of
a much vaster semanticsymbolic reality, controlled by the free will of a
great number of seities that communicate with each other. And each seity
can observe reality only from her own particular point of view, and
based on her overall experience and intention.</p>
<p>No seity can observe the “objective” reality described by the laws of
physics because the equations describing this reality are solvable only
when the reference frame of the observer and the initial conditions are
specified. This means that the equations must be solved based on the
choices and point of view of each observer and will therefore describe
different realities. There is no privileged point of view outside this
reality from which this “objective reality” can be observed, for all
observers are inside and part of this reality. Moreover, each
observation changes the observable reality in an unpredictable way based
on the free-will choices that are in turn based on the semantic reality
of each observer.</p>
<p>In summary, we clearly see that the inner semantic reality influences
the outer symbolic reality, and vice versa. We also see that the
vibrations emitted or observed in response to the semantic experience of
a seity represent an influence from the whole (the seity) to the parts
(the atoms and molecules of the air), through the free-will choices of
the quantum entity (the seity), mediated by the living organism
controlled by her. This can only happen because the seities are not
classical systems, and therefore they constitute a whole that is beyond
the sum of the physical parts of their bodies. This whole is in fact not
part of the body.</p>
<p>A classical system such as a robot, on the other hand, is made up of
classical parts that are statistical aggregates of uncorrelated live
symbols controllable only by classical symbols. Note that classical
symbols are also produced and exchanged by living organisms, which are
quantum-classical systems controllable by seities with live symbols.
Lacking any “inner experience,” the robot’s parts cannot create a whole
that is more than their sum. In other words, there can be no “robot”
independent of its parts that can control the parts “from the inside,”
even though the robot could be controlled “from the outside” by a
conscious being.</p>
<p>The situation I have described is similar to that of a pilot
controlling a drone flying thousands of kilometers away. Information
about the outer world and the internal state of the drone is sensed and
processed by the drone and communicated to the pilot. The pilot
experiences in his consciousness the situation in which the drone is
operating and freely decides the drone’s next moves by sending
high-level commands to it. Note that the commands are based on the
pilot’s intentions and purposes, not the drone’s, since the drone is
unconscious and could never make any sense of them. In this example, the
drone is to the pilot as the pilot is to the seity. The pilot, however,
is a quantum-classical living organism that is much more sophisticated
than the classical drone. And the seity is a quantum entity that can
only exist in the vaster reality of One that contains both the inner
world of meaning and the outer symbolic world of live information.</p>
<h1 id="the-vibrational-universe">The Vibrational Universe</h1>
<p>Even what seems inert like a stone has a certain frequency of
vibrations. —Pythagoras</p>
<p>We can now imagine generalizing the example of the square to the
entire universe, which then becomes an ensemble of communicating
seities. The vibrations that they emit and observe, however, can no
longer be described as classical atoms and molecules in the square, but
as quantum vibrations that combine and create a vibrational space
similar to the one formed by the electromagnetic waves (photons) and
quantum waves of the other elementary particles. This is the space of
live information.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine that before the appearance of living organisms,
there are many seities that communicate with each other in the way I
described earlier, but this time using live symbols directly, without
the intermediation of living organisms (bodies). Like before, each seity
decides which portion of the vibrational space to observe and which live
information to add to that space. The repetition of communication cycles
therefore leads to the coevolution of the symbolic vibrational space and
the semantic and subjective space of self-knowing.</p>
<p>Since we expect correlations and correspondences between semantic and
symbolic realities, the hierarchical structure that we observe in the
symbolic reality suggests that the seities organize themselves in a
corresponding hierarchy, starting from the CUs. The CUs are similar to
the fields of elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons, and
electrons) described by physics whose states describe the live symbols
they create. The concept of field is the only one we currently have
available to describe entities that have no boundaries and exist
everywhere in the same spacetime. However, to also represent the
interiority of the seities, the fields must be conscious and have free
will.</p>
<p>As we already discussed, the seity is a conscious entity that can
also “incarnate” in a “body” that she controls. The “process of
incarnation” is necessary for the seities to operate effectively within
physical reality and achieve the cognitive objectives they set out to
attain. It is reasonable to think that the identification of the ego
with the body is not a coincidence, but is chosen by the seities to be
able to make authentic and deeply felt free-will choices that could not
occur if they thought they were part of a simulation. The severity of
the identification varies and when the ego only pays attention to the
live symbols produced by the body, the ego could completely isolate
himself from the seity.</p>
<p>Normally there is a certain communication between the ego and the
seity, which manifests in the form of intuitions, ideas, emotions,
thoughts, and imaginations. The lower the degree of identification of
the ego with the body, the deeper the communication between ego and
seity can be. The ego perceives as “objects” what, in the vaster reality
of the seities, are complex combinations of live symbols.</p>
<p>When the ego is totally identified with the body, he believes that
the only reality is the one perceived by the body’s sensory system, a
belief that may lead him to censor that portion of the live symbols
coming from the seity that do not involve the physical reality perceived
by the body. These are the live symbols that the seity intends to
communicate directly to the ego through other channels that I expect to
be present in the body. It follows that the ego is led to perceive only
what he is willing to accept, and this may obscure his ability to
understand the nature of his inner reality and further separates him
from the seity. Note that the seity and the ego are not directly
measurable with instruments in spacetime and can interact with
macroscopic physical objects only through a quantum-classical living
organism.</p>

<p>All living beings are different phenomena of a single universal
substance; they draw from the same metaphysical root, and their
difference is quantitative, not qualitative.</p>
<p>Giordano Bruno</p>
<p>I realize that these ideas may meet strong resistance from those who
have embraced the materialistic and reductionistic view of reality.
However, as Lord Byron said: “Opinions are meant to be changed,
otherwise how can one get to the truth?”</p>
<p>Quantum physics has created a deep bewilderment among physicists
indoctrinated in classical physics, to the point where most of them have
not yet accepted its profound messages. Albert Einstein himself observed
that: “The more successful quantum theory is, the more it seems
nonsense.” But if we take seriously what quantum physics is saying, we
should take into consideration the unorthodox view I am advocating.</p>
<p>In a letter to Oskar Pollak dated January 27, 1904, Franz Kafka
wrote:</p>
<p>If the book we are reading does not wake us up like a fist hammering
on our skull, why are we reading it? …what we need are those books that
deeply disturb us…a book must be like an ice ax that breaks the sea of
ice that is inside us.</p>
<p>If we consider that reality has two aspects, one inner and one outer,
just like we experience, we can overcome the interpretative difficulties
and the prejudices that prevent us from understanding quantum physics.
And, “This is how things suddenly become clear. And then you realize how
obvious they have always been” (Madeleine L’Engle).</p>
<p>This model is consistent both with the experimental results of
physics and with the ordinary and extraordinary conscious experiences
lived by those who have deeply explored their own inner reality. Only in
our innermost being can we discover that the universe and life have
meaning and purpose. The study of mathematical symbols alone can never
reveal this truth. The experiments of physics and our mathematical
theories have already said all that they can say when they revealed
that: (1) the “waves” of quantum physics are probability amplitude
waves, not physical waves; (2) the actual state that will manifest
cannot be known, unless its has probability 1 of manifestation; (3)
there are distance-independent correlations called entanglement; and (4)
quantum information cannot be cloned. It is up to us to correctly
interpret further these mathematical symbols.</p>
<p>If we accept that quantum physics describes the characteristics of
inner reality, the next step should no longer be so surprising, namely,
accepting the idea that we are seities that interact with the physical
world through our quantum-classical bodies. The body can be compared to
a semi-autonomous drone or an avatar operating in a virtual reality. The
information revolution allows us to experience, and thus understand for
the first time, the ability to interact “inside” virtual realities.
Consequently we are now in a position to deepen the comprehension of the
nature of reality and the nature of conscious experience. Moreover, the
same reasoning capacity that led us to create computers and virtual
realities allows us to understand that life must be both quantum and
classical in order to allow seities to operate in a physical world of

dimensions.5</p>
<p>In early childhood, our consciousness has been conditioned to
perceive the symbols produced by the body as “reality,” making us forget
little by little the symbols of our native reality. This process led us
to identify with the body and partially separate the ego from the seity.
Since the ego pays most of his attention to the live symbols produced by
the body, he ends up believing that his intentions, emotions, and
thoughts originate in the body, forgetting that he is part of a vaster
reality. Qualia do not exist in the body, even though they have physical
correlates within it.</p>
<p>I think it is plausible to hypothesize that we have incarnated into
this physical reality to know ourselves more deeply and to facilitate
the discovery that we are an integral part of a greater seity.</p>
<h1 id="consciousness-identity-and-agency">Consciousness, Identity, and
Agency</h1>
<p>Seities are fields that share the same dynamism, holism, and Creative
Principle with One. Their properties have no definable boundaries; they
are unlike any classical object, including many of the mathematical
abstractions we have invented. Identity, free-will agency, and
consciousness are inseparable and coemergent properties of seities. This
means that identity could not exist without consciousness and agency,
and the same is true for the other two. In other words, these are
indivisible and irreducible aspects that are an integral part of each
seity. I will therefore describe them without attempting to define them
since they are inseparable.6</p>
<p>Consciousness includes the ability of the seity to have an inner
conscious experience made of qualia and to recognize it as her own
experience (selfconsciousness). The notion of identity is implicit in
this description since identity is that perspective that allows the
seity to know herself as the owner and director of her own experience.
Identity is what gives selfconsciousness, unity, purpose, and meaning to
the seity, allowing her to also recognize herself as distinct from the
other seities. Finally, agency is the ability of the seity to act with
free will through symbolic communications with other seities. Clearly,
free will implies the existence of identity, intention, and purpose. The
intention expresses the ultimate goal of the seity, while the purpose is
the immediate goal. And the two are generally aligned and coherent with
each other.</p>
<p>In the physical world an action generally involves pushing or
pulling. However, without a body an elementary action is the free-will
choice of which meaning to convert into live information to add to the
vibrational space, and which portion of the vibrational space to observe
and translate into meaning. Since the meaning refers to the quantum
information representing the entire state of the field, live information
refers to the outer state of the field, i.e., the symbols, shapes, or
vibrations of the field in spacetime. The objective physical universe is
therefore created from the set of these “vibrations” in spacetime.</p>
<p>I stress that in quantum physics an observation is a measurement that
changes the state of what is<br />
3 measured unpredictably. Therefore, the free-will decisions of which
states to observe change outer reality based on the observers’ inner
realities.<br />
4 In this case the robot would have to be predisposed by its designer
with an interrupt facility that an outside agent could use to control
its behavior, and/or some “input” instructions in its program that ask
an outside agent to intervene.<br />
5 The statistical organization of many uncorrelated live symbols forms
the physical support of classical symbols such as the bits and logic
gates of the computer hardware. A living cell is instead a
quantum-classical structure made of highly correlated live symbols that
can communicate directly with a seity with live symbols, and with the
classical world using classical symbols. The presence of live
information in a cell can be amplified and transformed into classical
information just like our particle detectors can amplify the weak
effects produced by elementary particles.<br />
6 Insisting that we must define the concepts that belong to the inner
reality, as we define mathematical objects, changes the nature of what
we should comprehend. When we impose our vision of reality upon reality,
we no longer study reality but a model of reality that is not
reality.</p>
<h1 id="the-evolution-of-the-seities-1">The Evolution of the
Seities</h1>
<p>Birth and death are just a door through which we go in and out. Birth
and death are just a game of hide and seek.</p>
<p>—Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
<p>Understanding the nature of life and consciousness, especially in
connection with the death of the body, has always occupied human minds.
What happens when we die? Is it the end of everything or is there
something about us that survives death? The various theories that have
been advanced range from one extreme, “When the body dies it is the end
of us,” to the other, “Our consciousness is eternal.” Clearly, the body
dissolves when it dies. If something survives, it must be part of the
seity; therefore it is inevitable to ask: “What is the relationship
between matter and consciousness?” “What is consciousness and where does
it come from?”</p>
<p>Among the various theories, panpsychism stands out as the most
natural and ancient. According to it, consciousness has always been part
of the ontology of the universe. Therefore, everything that exists, such
as a grain of sand, a stone, a plant, an animal, a planet, and so on,
must be conscious. As scientific discoveries have clarified over time
the nature of reality, various forms of panpsychism have succeeded one
another. The most recent version is based on the atomism of classical
physics, but it has been discredited because of the “combination
problem,” which has proved to be unsolvable. David Chalmers puts the
problem this way: “How can micro-phenomenal properties combine to form
macro-phenomenal properties?” This is the same kind of criticism that
the American psychologist William James made of panpsychism at the
beginning of the twentieth century, when he asked: “How can the minds of
a hundred individuals agglomerate into a single compound mind, when no
one has ever observed such a phenomenon?”</p>
<h1 id="the-combination-problem">The Combination Problem</h1>
<p>The panpsychism based on classical physics requires each atom to have
its own individual consciousness. When two atoms combine and create a
molecule, what happens to their consciousness? There are two
possibilities: (1) the consciousness of the molecule is the sum of the
consciousnesses of the two atoms, (2) the consciousnesses of the two
atoms combine and form a third consciousness, that of the molecule.</p>
<p>In the first case, the consciousnesses of the two atoms do not
combine at all, therefore it is impossible to explain the existence of
any consciousness higher than that of the individual atoms.</p>
<p>In the second case we have two possibilities: the atoms lose their
consciousness in the combination, or, the atoms retain their
consciousness. If we accept the first possibility, we can explain the
existence of a higher consciousness, but how can the two atoms lose
their consciousness if this was their constitutive property? In the
second possibility, there are three consciousnesses starting from two.
Where does the third one come from?</p>
<p>This problem cannot be solved in the context of classical physics and
it is precisely this impossibility that allows us to say that
consciousness cannot emerge from a computer or a brain as classical
structures. We have already seen that a classical system is
deterministic and reductionistic, therefore its behavior is the sum of
the behaviors of its parts, and there cannot be a whole that is
independent of the sum of the parts. This is the reason why a classical
system could only be conscious if its atoms were also conscious. But in
this case no higher combination of consciousnesses could exist, exactly
like in the first case described earlier.1</p>
<p>There remains one last idea to solve the combination problem, namely
that consciousness may be a quantum phenomenon. This hypothesis was
advanced as early as the 1930s by John von Neumann and others, when he
stated, some say half-jokingly, that the observer’s consciousness could
be the cause of the collapse of the wave function. However, this
hypothesis has remained infertile, because no one has ever managed to
find a meaningful connection between the properties of consciousness and
those of quantum physics.</p>
<h1 id="the-solution-of-the-combination-problem">The Solution of the
Combination Problem</h1>
<p>To my knowledge, QIP theory is the first theory that clearly
recognizes the strong similarity between consciousness and a pure
quantum state. QIP identifies a pure quantum state as the mathematical
representation of a conscious experience by the system that is in that
state. As such, it is a panpsychist theory that does not, however, have
the combination problem.</p>
<p>To better clarify how QIP solves such a problem, let’s take a
molecule of sodium chloride (NaCl) as an example. NaCl is the quantum
combination of a sodium atom (Na) and a chlorine atom (Cl). The molecule
of NaCl resulting from this combination is a new entity with completely
different properties from those of the two constituent atoms. In fact,
the interaction of very many NaCl molecules forms a hard crystal,
whereas many sodium atoms combine into a soft solid, and many chlorine
atoms form a gas. The transformation of the properties of a single
sodium atom and the properties of a single chlorine atom into the
completely new properties of one molecule of sodium chloride is a
quantum phenomenon that classical physics cannot explain. Within
classical physics, the state of a system composed of a sodium atom and a
chlorine atom that bounce elastically against each other would simply be
the sum of the two. Instead, their quantum combination creates a new
entity with an entirely new set of properties in which the two atoms
have lost their former identity.</p>
<p>If each atom were conscious, the quantum combination of the two into
a molecule would lead to the elimination of the consciousness of the
atoms that combined. If the molecule were later split into its two
component atoms, the consciousness of the molecule would be lost and be
regained by the two atoms. This makes the idea that atoms and molecules
are individually conscious inconsistent. However, we already know that
the elementary particles of which the atoms are “made” do not exist as
objects separate from their corresponding fields. Therefore it is
reasonable to assume that the conscious entities are the fields and not
the particles, which are simply the states of the fields that are
inseparable from the fields.2</p>
<p>The combination problem arises only when we do not recognize that
consciousness is a quantum property of a field and not a property of the
states of a field. When the “sodium” seity (a field) found a way to
combine with the “chlorine” seity for the first time, the two gave birth
to the “sodium chloride” seity, which is a new field with semantic and
symbolic properties completely different from those of their components.
The sodium chloride molecule is then a state of the NaCl seity, and
therefore it is not conscious, for it is a “form” within the NaCl field.
The field is the conscious entity, not the states of the field. When a
NaCl molecule is divided into its component atoms, it no longer exists
as a state of the NaCl field; however, the consciousness of the field
does not undergo any change, just like our consciousness would not
disappear if our body were destroyed.</p>
<p>The combination of two seities into a higher-order seity can be
explained as a quantum phenomenon due to the superposition and
entanglement of two fields that would lead to the formation of a new
field of higher dimensionality. The identity symbol of the new field is
the quantum combination of the identity symbols of the component fields,
with new and unexpected properties, like in the example of the NaCl
molecule. In other words, two seities are two distinct fields that can
give birth to a new field, without ceasing to exist. We must not confuse
the quantum combination of the identity symbols with the combination of
the fields (seities).</p>
<p>The combination problem can therefore be solved in the context of QIP
theory, since consciousness is a quantum phenomenon and the quantum
superposition of two pure states creates a new pure state with very
different characteristics than their components. This would be
impossible if consciousness were a classical phenomenon. Consciousness
is purely quantum, and so is free will, as we will see later.</p>
<p>The attribution of consciousness and free will to quantum systems
that are in a pure state with the conversion from quantum information to
live information, and vice versa, has enormous consequences in science,
philosophy, and spirituality. In this theory, free will and
consciousness coexist and allow the existence of systems capable of
transforming meaning (represented by quantum information) into live
information, and vice versa. This is based on the capacity of such
systems to direct their own conscious experience with free will.</p>
<p>How could a pure quantum state that is not knowable by anybody
correspond to any reality? Stipulating that a pure quantum state can be
known by the “system” that is in that state gives a reason for the
existence and purpose of quantum information, leading to a completely
new interpretation of the nature of reality that returns meaning and
purpose to the universe.</p>
<h1 id="semantic-and-symbolic-spaces">Semantic and Symbolic Spaces</h1>
<p>If we start with the assumption that there exists a vaster quantum
reality made up of seities that communicate symbolically with each
other, then the universe currently described by physics represents only
the symbolic aspect of the communications of the seities. With this new
assumption, what we call spacetime could be directly linked to the
specific representation of reality created by the body used by the
seity. In other words, the “objects interacting in spacetime” that we
perceive and believe to be reality are primarily determined by the
nature of the information sensing and processing performed by the
particular body through which the seity observes and acts within the
symbolic reality.</p>
<p>It is therefore useful to introduce two concepts that will help us
visualize the reality of the seities prior to the existence of
spacetime, the nature of which is probably less fundamental than it is
now considered in physics. I call these two concepts

-space. C-space is the space of the private conscious experiences of the
seities that collectively make up the subjective inner world of
experience. I-space is the symbolic space of live information
constituting the objective vibrational space shared by all seities as
previously described. C-space and I-space are indivisible and represent
the two subjective-objective, semantic-symbolic, and inner-outer aspects
of the basic reality of the communicating seities. These spaces are
extraphysical and do not need to be tridimensional.</p>
<p>We have seen that the communication of each seity consists of an
observation phase, during which the seity chooses which shared symbols
of I-space to observe, followed by an experiential phase in which the
seity translates the observed symbols into subjective meaning in
C-space. Then the action phase follows, in which the seity chooses which
portion of her meaning to translate into objective and shared symbols to
be added to Ispace. Then the communication cycle of each seity describes
the transformations from I-space to C-space, and vice versa, controlled
by her free will. In this model, the interactions between inner and
outer reality play a fundamental role in the evolution of One. Free-will
agency, identity, and consciousness express the intention and ability of
each seity to guide her own experience and pursue her self-knowing. At
the same time, each seity also contributes to the self-knowing of the
other seities in a deeply cooperative enterprise. The self-knowing of
One is the superposition of all the selfknowing of the seities that have
emerged from It.</p>
<p>As the seities know themselves, the live symbols evolve and
transform, creating ever more sophisticated languages suitable for
representing their ever-growing self-knowing. This evolution is a
process similar to that of our languages that spontaneously coevolved
with our knowing. The symbols and the symbolic laws that created what we
call the inanimate universe represent the first stage of the coevolution
of symbols and meaning of the seities.</p>
<p>The next stage created biological life.3 By studying live symbols,
the seities realized that the formal properties of the symbols could
help them deepen their own self-knowing. Through a highly cooperative
process, this study gradually led to the creation of increasingly
complex symbolic structures which culminated in the creation of the
first living cell. Cells are semi-autonomous symbols that reproduce and
allow the seities to explore Ispace, the objective world of symbols,
through them.</p>
<p>The invention-development-evolution of biological life has allowed
the seities to deepen their own self-knowing through the exploration of
I-space, a symbolic space that reflects the inner structure of meaning
in the outer structure of its live symbols and syntactical laws.
Therefore the study of Ispace helps the seities know themselves, just
like the study of our languages helps us know ourselves.</p>
<p>By following a similar path, we have learned to use matter (classical
information) to create the technologies that have made possible the
building of computers, drones, and immersive virtual realities
accessible with special headsets. In this manner human beings are able
to explore objective symbolic worlds by using their own consciousness.
These virtual realities, built with classical information, exist as
small subsets inside the sea of live information that forms I-space.</p>
<p>Biological life reflects the need of the seities to recreate at the
symbolic level, through the exquisite workings of living organisms, the
semantic structures they recognize within their own direct self-knowing
(meaning). This is an extraordinary cognitive opportunity, deriving from
the homomorphism between the symbols and their meaning that
spontaneously emerged in the coevolution of the two. This is also what
happens when we use poetry or music to find a deeper expressive capacity
in our ordinary symbols, allowing us to translate what we feel by going
beyond the ordinary limits of classical symbols. “Every poem is
mysterious. Nobody fully knows what they have been allowed to write”
(Jorge Luis Borges). And the poet Alfred Tennyson observes that:</p>
<p>Words, like Nature, half reveal And half conceal the Soul within.</p>
<p>I think that the creation of biological life represents the crowning
achievement of a collective cognitive process by the seities through
which they discovered that their live symbols and symbolic laws allowed
them to create self-reproducing live symbols!4 Reproduction is the
fundamental property with which One created the CUs in Its own image and
likeness. It is the origin of Life! This capacity has been inherited by
the seities, for they also can create other seities out of themselves.
Reproducing reproduction at the symbolic level is an expression of
monumental creativity and intelligence that allows open-ended cognitive
progress in new directions.</p>
<p>In the proposed model, we can imagine a CU like a single cell, a
seity like a multicellular organism, and One like the environment that
contains, sustains, and connects all biological entities. In this
analogy, living organisms are part of the physical environment (I-space)
and yet they are inseparable from it since they are open and dependent
on it. These organisms are patterns of interactivity within, and of, the
environment, for their borders are wide open and live information is
constantly exchanged between each organism and the environment. Yet,
every organism is conscious, has a unique identity, and can act with
free will to pursue its own experiences.</p>
<p>These latter properties, however, do not exist within I-space but in
Cspace, the vaster semantic space that “contains” I-space and can be
represented with quantum information. C-space contains seities, i.e.,
fields that can transform qualia into live symbols, and vice versa, to
communicate with each other directly, or to communicate with living
organisms which behave like immensely sophisticated drones. In other
words, each organism is only a dynamic pattern of live information that
exchanges information within I-space. Some of the informational exchange
is between the organism and the seity, though the organism is not
conscious and thus it has no way to know where the I-space symbols it
observes are coming from, just like in the case of a drone in
spacetime.</p>
<p>The evolution of living cells made possible the creation of a huge
variety of virtual worlds in which the seities could “incarnate” in
different forms (live symbols) and explore symbolic worlds within
I-space. Each virtual world has its own live symbols and symbolic laws
and serves to deepen specific aspects of self-knowing of the incarnating
seities. I call P-space the “physical world” experienced by the seity
that believes herself to be the organism in which she is incarnated.
P-space will then mirror the specific informational reality of I-space
that is observed and processed by the organism. This reality derives
from the unique sensory-brain-actuators possessed by the organism and
through the free-will decisions of the seity in</p>
<p>C-space that controls the organism and experiences the live
information created by it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the true causes of the events occurring in P-space cannot
be found in either
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mo>−</mo></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{P}_{-}</annotation></semantics></math>
or I-space. The real causes are the free-will decisions of the CUs and
seities occurring in C-space. It is important to realize that One does
not have any exteriority and cannot be found anywhere in either I-space
or P-space.</p>
<h1 id="there-is-much-more-than-physical-space">There Is Much More Than
Physical Space</h1>
<p>I envision the experience of a non-incarnated seity in C-space to be
a completely natural process in which the transformations from live
symbols to meaning, and vice versa, are automatic, and the seity knows
her conscious experience based on qualia. In other words, the seity does
not need to know anything about the “mechanisms” by which she naturally
interacts with the live symbols of I-space. We could compare this
experience to that of a child who knows nothing about the functioning of
the world in which he finds himself. He follows his inclinations and
impulses, choosing the things he wants to pay attention to and the
actions to take.</p>
<p>Without a body, the actions of a seity are communications, i.e.,
automatic transformations from meaning to live symbols, and vice versa,
spontaneously performed by the quantum seity interacting directly with
I-space symbols. These live symbols are the “objects” that populate the
“universe” in which the seity exists. It is likely that initially the
seities didn’t know anything about the live information they emitted and
observed. Their rational capacity to pose questions and find answers was
probably a later conquest allowing them to investigate “from the
outside” the inner structure of their own meaning reflected in the
symbols of their natural language.</p>
<p>This conquest was probably a direct consequence of their
comprehension that the live symbols could also be used as long-term
memory to store the meaning of their experiences. This crucial
achievement would allow the seities to develop a form of metacognition
that led to the gradual evolution of rationality, a process that
humankind repeated with the invention of writing.</p>
<p>Comprehension combined with rationality then made possible the
creation of new symbolic structures capable of representing their
increasing self-knowing, leading to the gradual development of living
cells as their proficiency in the manipulation of live symbols
increased. These marvelous structures allowed the seities to examine the
“functioning” of the symbolic world from the point of view of another
symbol.</p>
<p>This new creative and intellectual development led the seities to
eventually evolve human bodies to capture and expand their ever-higher
level of comprehension. Operating through human bodies, the seities
could then create new types of classical symbols that could not happen
by chance. I am speaking of our machines, computers, artificial
intelligence, and robots that would allow, once more, the dramatic
extension of the range of virtual realities that the seities could
eventually explore with new types of bodies that combine live and
classical symbols. We have now arrived at the threshold of this possible
future for humankind.</p>
<p>The creation of the first living cell allowed seities to have a
conscious experience of the symbolic world, as perceived through the
“senses” and the “processing” of live information made by cells and
increasingly complex multicellular living organisms. A seity comprehends
the live symbols within a cell, and can interpret them from the point of
view of the cell through her unique qualia. Moreover, the seity can
manipulate these live symbols inside the cell, while respecting the
probabilistic syntactical rules of the live symbols. In other words, the
seity controls a cell as if it were a drone belonging to I-space.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to that of the early video games in which
the screen represents a virtual reality with an avatar, which is the
equivalent of a drone, seen from the outside. The player (the seity)
controls the avatar by perceiving the avatar, the virtual reality, and
the physical reality in which the screen and the computer exist. By
manipulating remote controls, the player directs the avatar according to
her will and observes the virtual reality, well aware that such reality
is part of a larger reality that contains it.</p>
<p>The next step in the evolution of video games is represented by
“immersive” virtual realities in which the player wears a headset and a
costume that allows him to observe the virtual reality, and act in it,
entirely from the point of view of the avatar. By moving naturally, the
player controls the body of the avatar automatically and, if she is in a
quiet room, she will perceive only the signals coming from the virtual
reality. Under these conditions, the player might easily identify with
the avatar and end up paying attention only to the signals coming from
it, forgetting—if only for a short period of time—that she actually
exists in a greater physical reality containing the virtual reality. She
will certainly notice this fact if the signals coming from the virtual
reality were to suddenly cease (the “death” of the avatar), a situation
that would be like waking up from a vivid dream.</p>
<p>A similar condition also applies to a seity embodied in a living
organism when she becomes completely identified with the symbolic
reality perceived by the organism. Believing herself to be the organism
through which she operates in the physical world, she will only pay
attention to the symbols produced by the organism. Only when the
organism dies can she realize that she had not been paying attention to
the other symbols of the vaster reality in which she existed (I-space).
She had been so captivated by her adventures that she forgot her true
nature.</p>
<h1 id="the-nature-of-p-space">The Nature of P-space</h1>
<p>The physical space and the objects experienced by the seity during
her “incarnation” in P-space result from her “coloring” the symbolic
representation of I-space made by the organism with her native qualia.
In other words, the seity that has identified with the organism ends up
interacting only with the live symbols that form the representation of
I-space created by the organism, forgetting that such a world is a
secondary, reduced reality, contained in the greater fundamental reality
of I-space. This interpretation naturally leads to the sensible
hypothesis that the physical reality we believe to be foundational may
only be a vastly reduced reality produced primarily by the information
processing performed by our physical body.</p>
<p>However, the body could in turn be a symbolic structure that is part
of another more fundamental symbolic structure also existing in I-space,
in Chinese-box style. The world of dreams and the worlds explored by
those who “leave the body” through an OBE (Out of Body Experience) could
then be explained if our physical body were itself contained within an
“astral” body existing in a greater symbolic reality that is not yet the
fundamental reality.</p>
<p>In this case the astral reality would be contained in I-space and
there would then be three different kinds of live symbols: physical,
astral, and mental, producing respectively the physical, emotional, and
mental qualia experienced in C-space by the seity. Physical symbols
would then be combinations of more fundamental astral symbols, and these
would be combinations of even more fundamental mental symbols, the
latter being the native symbols of I-space. The evidence of OBE and
lucid dreams, in which the dreamer’s ego knows he is dreaming and can
partially control the progress of the dream, could then be explained by
this type of hypothesis.</p>
<p>With the death of the organism, the seity loses her identification
with Pspace and realizes that she exists in another reality where she
enjoys a different and greater freedom. Of this we can have an intuition
thanks to the evocative power of Giordano Bruno’s verses in Of the
Infinite, Universe, and Worlds:</p>
<p>Therefore safe wings I offer to the air nor do I fear intrusion of
crystal or glass; but I fly the skies, and to infinity I rise.</p>
<p>In this view, dying is nothing more than waking up from a “vivid
dream” in which the seity was convinced she existed, and opening up to a
vaster experience while retaining the same identity.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then truly the day of death becomes a dies
natalis, as Lucius Annaeus Seneca writes in Moral Letters to
Lucilius:</p>
<p>This day that you fear as the last is the birthday into eternity…The
day will come in which the mysteries of nature will be revealed to you,
the haze that surrounds us will dissolve, and a radiance will strike us
from all sides, combining and merging within itself the light of the
stars. No shadow will disturb that serenity and the sky will shine with
the same light: day and night alternate only in this lowest part of the
cosmos. We will become aware of the darkness of this mortal life when,
with our whole being, we will gaze at all the splendor that now comes to
us, and only minimally, through the too-narrow passage of our eyes. What
will that light look like to you when you will see it in its source?</p>
<p>Precisely because we all dream, we can all understand how we can
become engrossed, identified, with different realities to the point of
believing that only those realities exist. Within this context, an
incarnation may severely limit the degree of freedom available in our
native reality since the body is a symbol subject to the stricter laws
of the virtual reality in which it exists and operates.</p>
<p>In summary, P-space exists only as the experience of the ego of the
live symbols produced by the organism he controls. The ego is that
portion of a seity’s consciousness that believes himself to be the
organism. The objectivity of P-space is only apparent, for it is shared
only by all the egos that interact with I-space through a body of the
same species. Different organisms such as a fish, an eagle, a lion, or a
tree allow a seity/ego to explore a vast range of different P-spaces.
And when the organism dies, the ego “returns” to the vaster reality from
which he actually never “moved” away.5</p>
<p>P-space is like a virtual reality created by the organism—even though
the qualia with which such reality is perceived are those native to the
seity. The crucial difference between the native reality and the one
experienced by an embodied ego is that the native one comes from the
seity’s direct interaction with “unprocessed” I-space symbols while
P-space comes from the I-space symbols produced by the living organism
that observes I-space with its specific sensory-brain system.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that, if we start from the hypothesis
that CUs and seities existed before physical reality, the concepts of
space, time, matter, and energy, which are considered primitives in
physics, must be reconceptualized as deriving directly from the nature
of the seities’ interactions with I-space. This new vision requires a
complete rethinking of what we have hitherto accepted as fundamental
axioms. The result will be an immensely significant new science that
unifies our inner and outer realities. I believe the union of science
and spirituality is the necessary step to solving the outstanding
problems we are facing at this critical juncture in human history.</p>
<h1 id="knowing-life-and-information-1">Knowing, Life, and
Information</h1>
<p>Knowing is a light of the soul. Meister Eckhart</p>
<p>The dream of contemporary physicists is to be able to find a theory
of everything that explains all phenomena, starting from a unified field
and a universal law. This is not very different from the materialistic
assumptions of classical physicists who tried to explain everything
starting from elementary particles which were thought to be the simplest
possible objects. Now the objects have become states of quantum fields,
a more abstract concept, but the essence of the new plan is a
physicalist assumption not much different than materialism since it
assumes that the universe is an informationprocessing system, i.e., an
abstract machine ruled by an algorithm. Therefore, everything contained
in the universe is another abstract machine.</p>
<p>In my opinion we are still too influenced by classical physics which
tells us that the world is made of separate parts, and comforts us by
saying that at the macroscopic scale the world works perfectly well as
described by it. Here it is in the words of 1988 Nobel Prize winner,
American physicist Leon Max Lederman: “When enormous quantities of atoms
unite to form macroscopic objects (airplanes, bridges, and robots), the
disturbing and counterintuitive quantum phenomena, with their load of
uncertainty, seem to cancel each other out and bring the phenomena back
into the precise predictability of Newtonian physics.” This is only
partially true, however, given the indeterminism and nonlocal nature of
quantum physics and the presence of chaotic systems.</p>
<p>However, quantum physics, from which classical physics emerges as a
subset, tells us instead that there are neither separate parts, nor
particles as objects; nor does probability exist as we imagined it in
classical physics. Therefore, there is becoming in the universe which
cannot be predicted by any equation or algorithm. This means that the
universe could have evolved in an infinity of possible ways using
exactly the same laws. In fact, these laws contain 25 physical constants
that need to be adjusted with extreme precision to create the universe
in which we live, based on
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>a</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math>
posteriori knowledge. How did those parameters happen to have those
specific finetuned values we assigned to them to match what we now
measure in our universe?</p>
<p>Finally, I point out that the union of quantum physics with an
adequate theory of quantum gravity, as now proposed, would still not be
able to explain the origin of life, consciousness, and free will—and
therefore it would not be a theory of everything—unless these properties
were incorporated into the properties of the unified field, which would
then become what I call One. Then the evolution of the universe no
longer needs to be dictated by impersonal laws with 25 predetermined
fine-tuned physical constants whose origin cannot be explained. In fact,
each of these constants acts like an axiom within the current Standard
Model of particle physics.</p>
<p>In the current scientific methodology, we have replaced the
comprehension of reality with an intellectual understanding of the
mathematical theory of reality, as if the two were the same. Thus, the
comprehension of reality is exhausted by saying: “It is this way because
the mathematics says so.” This attitude would be almost correct if we
were sure that the mathematical theory of reality accurately describes
all reality, but we know instead that the current theories leave out
life, consciousness, and free will, the very aspects that give meaning
to the universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, mathematics can only describe the symbolic aspect of
reality, not the semantic aspect. Mathematics is only descriptive and
not prescriptive, as it is widely believed. Mathematics is not ontology
and cannot create conscious seities. Mathematics cannot give birth to a
brain, whereas brains guided by the creativity of seities can give birth
to mathematics.</p>
<p>To create a model of physical reality we need a body capable of
interacting with reality and equipped with a brain controlled by a
sufficiently evolved seity to be able to create valid concepts starting
from observations and interactions with reality. Only seities can evolve
the brains that, properly supervised, can then create the mathematics
that explains the symbolic reality they collectively created in other
ways. It makes no sense to think that the seities designed the universe
starting from mathematics. In this model they started by communicating
with each other, following their own nature, and evolved a universe that
reflected that nature. Mathematics could much later describe the
self-consistency of the observable reality for the simple reason that,
for a universe to exist, it must be logically self-consistent. But
mathematics alone can bring neither the universe nor itself into
existence.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters I have portrayed a very different reality
from the one described starting from materialistic assumptions. This
different reality seems to function more like a living organism than a
machine because it is made of parts-whole like the seities. We generally
think that the elementary particles make up the whole by combining, as
in classical physics; however, this is not the case because the ontology
belongs to the quantum fields. The fields are the parts-whole and the
particles are simply their states that are “connected from within.” From
the outside the particles appear separable, but in reality they are
entangled in an unknowable way.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we have seen that the conscious comprehension
of a seity allows her to gradually perceive the invisible links forming
the inner structure of the meaning she feels. The desire to communicate
that meaning then renders visible and objective a portion of the meaning
through the complexity of the symbols necessary to represent it. Thus,
symbols take on a structure that is homomorphic to the inner structure
of the meaning. The most complex live symbol we know to exist is the
ecosystem of our planet, which consists of about
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>41</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{41}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms closely interacting with each other!</p>
<h1 id="the-world-of-knowing">The World of Knowing</h1>
<p>During the last 20 years we have realized that quantum information
cannot be cloned, and therefore it represents a world that is invisible
and unknowable from the outside. But what is the sense of “information
that is unknowable” if it does not make sense at least to the system
that holds that state? In the new axiom of QIP, a pure state represents
the “experience” or meaning of a quantum system that is in that state.
The ontology is thus the meaning of a private experience, and since the
representation must reflect the ontology, and not vice versa, the
mathematical representation of a private state must be a non-clonable
state, a state that cannot be known from the outside. All that can be
known must then follow Holevo’s theorem, i.e., it cannot be more than a
classical bit for each quantum bit contained in the pure state.</p>
<p>Note that the existence and the properties of pure quantum states
have been imposed by the properties of Hilbert space, the only
mathematical structure we found to be adequate to display the behavior
of quantum systems. To describe these systems, we must use the concept
of non-clonable information, which would make no sense if it did not
represent something significant for such systems. It is therefore
perfectly fitting to attribute consciousness to a quantum system that is
in a pure state, even though this attribution brings interiority into
physical reality.</p>
<p>On the other hand, how can we explain the existence of consciousness
if we do not admit the existence of interiority? As the philosopher
Joseph Levine states: “No explanation given entirely in physical terms
can ever account for conscious experience.” Consciousness is something
that cannot be explained in simpler terms than itself, therefore it must
be an elementary constitutive property of a private reality, just like
the particles (excited states of the quantum fields) are the elementary
constitutive properties of a public reality. This simple starting point
avoids having to later explain what would otherwise require
miracles.</p>
<p>Within QIP theory, the inner and the outer realities are connected by
stating that the conscious experience of a seity (a quantum field) can
be represented by a pure quantum state. We thus have a suitable
mathematical representation of inner knowing, or meaning. This theory
can then explain for the first time a baffling mathematical fact about
the quantum world: the existence of information that cannot be
reproduced. I claim that such information represents the private meaning
of a field whose excited states are the symbolic, shareable information
with which the field expresses a portion of its meaning.</p>
<p>With this interpretation, the entire philosophical conception of
physics changes, because the existence of an inner, private reality
implies that there is a purpose and a meaning in the universe, a
position that physics has never before accepted as valid.</p>
<p>With this highly plausible axiom, unexpected new possibilities arise
to answer the many unresolved questions we have accumulated so far. I
believe that we can now finally solve the measurement problem that has
puzzled physicists since the beginning of quantum physics. The “collapse
of the wave function” which occurs with an irreversible transformation
from a quantum state to a classical one can now be interpreted as a
free-will decision by a seity that creates a state that cannot be
predicted by any algorithm.</p>
<h1 id="the-world-of-life">The World of Life</h1>
<p>As we have already discussed, life is another major unsolved problem
of science. If the universe were indeed like it is described by the laws
of physics, it would have to be inanimate, just like all the other
planets in the solar system appear to be. The existence of life on our
planet is a huge “anomaly” that has never been adequately explained. And
the more we know about quantum physics, the more it seems impossible
that life could have self-organized out of natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Molecular biologists have always considered life as a phenomenon
explainable with classical physics. Only in the last 20 years has a
small avant-garde of scientists started to study life as a quantum
phenomenon. I think that life is both a quantum and a classical
phenomenon, with new and unsuspected properties that will lead us to a
deeper understanding of the nature of reality. To me, life is the
fundamental strategy with which One can know Itself, for self-knowing
must be a “lived” experience, and life is therefore the process through
which each seity progressively comprehends the meaning of her own
experience and knows herself. Each seity gradually makes her
self-knowing explicit, first inside and then outside herself, via
symbolic constructions made of live and classical information. This
information can be copied and therefore communicated, leading to the
proliferation of meanings (comprehensions) that were originally private,
each known only by a single seity.</p>
<p>This knowing feeds the collective cognitive processes, accelerating
the self-knowing of One. The great mystical poet Jalal al-Din Rumi
wrote:</p>
<p>Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript of a divine
letter.<br />
You are a mirror reflecting a noble face.<br />
This universe is not outside of you.<br />
Look inside yourself; everything you want is already there.</p>
<p>I note that we also use a similar process to comprehend. For example,
when we want to clarify an idea, we represent it on a piece of paper, or
we may build a physical model, or write a computer program that makes a
dynamic simulation of it. The marks we make on a piece of paper, on a
computer memory, or on a physical model represent the long-term memory
of the “symbolic construction” that represents our comprehension using
classical information. When the construction “works,” it means that we
have understood. This comprehension then applies not only to us but also
to many other people who would not have been able to comprehend on their
own. They do so by observing the functioning model that is shareable
because it is made of classical information. The classical model
functions then like a “mental enzyme” that lowers the “barrier” to
comprehension.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of the creative process with which lived
experiences lead to the coevolution of quantum information (meaning),
live information (life), and classical information (matter).2 This
process also explains why classical physics must exist since it allows
the creation of long-term memory, and shareable dynamical models that
spread the comprehensions among the seities. Thus, the seities do not
forget their experiences and can cooperatively continue to deepen their
meanings by communicating with live and classical symbols. If the
purpose of One is to know Itself, all Its self-knowing must be preserved
and deepened.</p>
<p>The lived experience is that obtained through the embodiment of a
seity into a living organism. The organism transforms the classical
information of the environment into live information which is then
experienced and comprehended by the seity as a reality that illuminates
and accelerates its self-knowing process. This process requires two
distinct classes of transformations: (1) transformations of live
information into quantum information, and vice versa, performed by the
embodied seity that communicates with the organism, and (2)
transformations of live information into classical information, and vice
versa, performed by the living organism interacting with the world of
live and classical information.</p>
<p>The world of classical information is purely symbolic and represents
the material world that has hitherto been considered “everything that
exists” by science. The world of live information is represented by
atoms and molecules “organized” into living organisms. Living organisms
are partswhole that can maintain their self-coherence for some time and
reproduce. Such organisms require live information and could not exist
in the world of classical information that is supported by incoherent
(disorganized, uncorrelated) matter.</p>
<p>Live information is something in between quantum and classical
information. Something that so far has not been clearly identified. I
imagine it as information that could only be represented by a dynamical
classical system with infinite precision. As such, it could only be
partially simulated by a computer but not emulated because something
would always be left out, given the limited precision of any computer.
Here is where the “infinity” of the qubits intrudes into the finiteness
of any classical representation.</p>
<p>Live information has not lost its connection with the wholeness of
the quantum world that describes the ontology of experience. Our
consciousness can sense that infinity and respond. A computer cannot. A
living organism passively reflects that infinity into its functioning
since it is made of live information. Thus a living organism, even as a
physical system only, cannot be fully simulated by a digital
computer.</p>
<h1 id="the-world-of-classical-information">The World of Classical
Information</h1>
<p>The classical physical world can be described with classical
information represented by collections of large numbers of uncorrelated
quantum states forming macroscopic “objects.” When the probabilistic
behaviors of those quantum states are averaged, their collective
behavior ends up obeying the deterministic laws of classical physics.
Therefore, within a classical system, the concept of information makes
no sense at all since the next state is always determined by the
application of a deterministic algorithm to the previous state. Thus,
the next state has always probability 1 to occur.3</p>
<p>If we analyze the amount of information carried by the state of a
classical computer, we will find that the evolution of its state is
predictable by those who know the program and how the computer works.
Therefore, the amount of information conveyed to them by each of its
states is 0. For those who are ignorant, the next state is
unpredictable, and therefore it may carry a lot of information. For
those who have partial knowledge, the amount of information has an
intermediate value. Therefore, the assumption that the quantity of
information is objective, as we have been generally told, can only be
true if all observers are equally ignorant, or do not exist. But what
would be the point of information if there were no observers? To proceed
any further it is necessary to reexamine the concept of probability.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-probability">What Is Probability?</h1>
<p>Probability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge. A perfect
acquaintance with all the circumstance affecting the occurrence of an
event would change expectation into certainty, and leave neither room
nor demand for a theory of probabilities.</p>
<p>George Boole</p>
<p>The concept of probability, which most physicists consider objective
and which underlies not only classical statistical physics but even more
subtly quantum physics, has never been satisfactorily resolved.
According to the famous statistician and mathematician Bruno de Finetti,
probability does not exist, and I completely agree with him. I think
that probability is a human concept, inextricably linked to the degree
of knowledge of a conscious observer who wants to act based on his
predictions of the next state. This concept makes no sense for an
unconscious, deterministic (classical) system which has no way to change
its future state.</p>
<p>Probability cannot be objective, because it is closely linked to the
expectations of a conscious observer endowed with free will, for knowing
is a property of consciousness, and knowing the probability without
being able to act based on that knowledge would make no sense. In other
words, probability is largely subjective.</p>
<p>Considering probability a concept independent of the consciousness
and free will of the observer, as if it were an objective physical
variable, is, in my opinion, another big misunderstanding that has
largely contributed to the incomprehensibility of quantum physics in
which this concept is central. Probability is about knowledge, and only
consciousness can know. Therefore probability has relevance only if
consciousness exists! The fact that quantum physics is about probability
is saying that the physical universe is about knowing! The white
elephant in the room is thus consciousness!</p>
<p>Probability is a fundamental variable in quantum physics because the
wave function represents the “probability amplitude” of a quantum state
whose square gives us the probability of its manifestation. In other
words, quantum physics does not describe the evolution of the actual
state of a system like classical physics does, but rather the evolution
of the probabilities of all the states that we might measure, i.e.,
know. Therefore, quantum physics primarily represents what we may be
able to know about the system rather than how the system will actually
behave.</p>
<p>An unconscious robot may be able to calculate probabilities, but only
if the human programmer so determined in its program. This fact does not
give objectivity to probability since the robot is blindly obeying its
program to compute what we call probability and does not know what it is
calculating. The robot does not make any prediction based on its
judgment because it has none of its own. We are the ones who made the
estimate we have called “probability” and are forcing the robot to
comply, for a robot is totally unaware. Thus, the robot is not
responsible for the consequences of its actions. The responsibility is
only ours.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that Shannon’s definition of
information, which refers to classical systems, would be inconsistent if
it did not secretly refer to conscious observers held to be separate
from the observed system, and thus unable to affect what they observe.
This assumption actually works well with classical systems because the
observation can occur without appreciably disturbing the system.
However, with quantum systems that are described by quantum information,
the observation deeply affects what is observed, and thus there is no
longer independence between observer and observed. Therefore, when the
observer cannot be separated from the universe, his decision of what to
observe changes the universe. Moreover, since information is the
cologarithm of probability, quantum physics ultimately deals only with
quantum information, and thus with knowing (conscious experience).</p>
<p>Note that since probability only makes sense if it implies the
existence of consciousness and free will, the problem of
consciousness—which has been kicked out the door—comes back through the
window in the form of the subjective probability of quantum physics.
Only when we recognize that quantum information describes the knowing of
conscious observers can quantum physics be understood.</p>
<h1 id="information-makes-sense-only-if-there-is-consciousness">Information
Makes Sense Only if There Is Consciousness</h1>
<p>We have seen that within a deterministic system the concept of
information makes no sense because every action is perfectly
predictable. Moreover, if the universe were deterministic, the notions
of observer and probability would make no sense whatsoever, for inside
such a universe everything is preordained, and outside it no observer
could exist. Curiously, there is an ontological interpretation of
reality called Block Universe that is endorsed by the physicists who
consider the theory of general relativity as fundamental. In such
interpretation, the universe has always existed as a sequence of
three-dimensional “frames” along a four-dimensional direction that
represents time. Time therefore does not exist, for which reason this
interpretation is also called eternalism.</p>
<p>According to the Block Universe, our experience of existing in a
threedimensional space and moving in time with free will is an illusion.
Therefore the Block Universe has eliminated from reality the only part
of us that knows about existing and Existence! If the Block Universe
existed, the one who came up with the idea of the Block Universe should
not exist. In other words, the existence of our consciousness falsifies
the hypothesis that the Block Universe exists.</p>
<p>At this point it should be clear that the concepts of observer,
consciousness, knowledge, meaning, probability, information, and symbols
are intimately interconnected and would make no sense if the Whole were
deterministic and reductionistic. Treating these concepts as if they
were separable is logically inconsistent. For example, the probability
that defines classical information makes no sense unless there are
conscious observers inside a deterministic universe, but such observers
could not be part of that universe! In fact, to contain a conscious
observer with free will, the universe must be indeterministic.
Therefore, the deterministic portion of that universe, if it exists,
should be contained as a special case within the indeterministic
universe.</p>
<p>The concept of information makes sense only in connection with the
concept of open-ended knowing, never completed, concerning conscious
observers with free will. Omniscience would spell the end of
consciousness and the end of existence because there would be nothing
more to know! Moreover, the existence of a universal consciousness
without the existence of other conscious entities, each with their own
individual consciousness, would not make sense because in this case
there would only be One observing Itself and no other. But this
hypothesis cannot be true because we are here and we are conscious. And
each one of us is a part-whole of One, and One is also “within” each of
us.</p>
<p>Consciousness only makes sense if it belongs to observers who wish to
increase their own knowing. And this requires the existence of new,
creative states, i.e., of new meaning and new symbols, and therefore of
new information. But this type of information is more like a combination
of live information and quantum information that for the time being I
will call Information with a capital “I.” It can therefore be said that
the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Information
is the existence of consciousness! But consciousness would not make
sense without entities who want and can know more by directing their own
knowing toward increasing Information. This is the reason why free will
and the open becoming of the universe must exist as well.</p>
<p>This Information is what I earlier called C-space and I-space, the
irreducible interiority and exteriority of the universe, One. I-space is
the collection of the states of the Field, the unified field that
theoretical physicists are currently trying to define. These states are
inseparable from the Field, and the Field currently is not intended to
have free will and consciousness. The Field with consciousness and free
will is a completely different entity that I have previously called One.
The self-knowing (meaning) of One is represented by the pure quantum
state of the Field, which is the superposition of the pure states of all
the fields that have emanated from One, which I have called seities. The
excited states of the Field represent the vibrational sphere, i.e., the
ensemble of all the live symbols used by the fields (seities) to
communicate and explore their meaning.</p>
<p>Consciousness, observer, knowledge, pure quantum states, and meaning
are an integral part of the aspect that I have called interiority, while
live information, probability, mixed states, and symbols are part of the
other aspect that I have called exteriority. But these two aspects must
be indivisible, because consciousness and information, as well as
meaning and symbols, make sense only if both exist together. Without
conscious observers, each having their own unique point of view and
capable of symbolically communicating with each other, there would be
nothing to know, nothing to discover, nothing to rejoice with, and
nothing to love.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the universe cannot be classical. If it were,
we could not exist, because consciousness and free will cannot exist in
a classical universe. And yet a classical universe is intimately
connected with live information which is homomorphic with quantum
information and indivisible from it. The classical universe emerges from
live information (statistical ensembles of uncorrelated states of live
information), like live information (entangled quantum states in
spacetime) emerges from quantum information (pure quantum states) that
represents the ontology of meaning that can only be known privately
within the fields (seities). The classical universe has the same type of
existence as a virtual reality created by a computer. Moreover, the
existence of entanglement tells us that all the parts of the universe
are interconnected, that there is becoming, and that free will allows us
to explore the world of meaning and transform new meaning into new
symbols. This is the essence of our individual and collective
creativity.</p>
<p>This is also why the knowing of a highly evolved seity can only be
adequately expressed with a complex live symbol such as a human being,
i.e., an organization of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>28</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{28}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms, and the knowing of a much more evolved seity that is much greater
than ours could be expressed using the ecosystem of our planet, a live
symbol that uses
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>41</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{41}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms. The complexity of these symbols gives us a measure of how vast is
the knowing of the seities that communicate with each other!</p>
<h1 id="knowing-and-live-information">Knowing and Live Information</h1>
<p>We have seen that knowing can only occur through lived experiences
that cause the seities to become what they know. Organic life exists to
enable the seities to make new experiences through living organisms
which, in this view, are creations of the seities that coevolve in step
with their selfknowing.This process creates a virtuous circle in which
each new knowing leads to more complex symbols that make possible more
new knowing. This process is endless because it tends towards an
infinity that can never be reached.</p>
<p>From an informational point of view, a living organism is a live
symbol, an informational vehicle that allows a seity to experience the
world of classical information. This symbol represents a small fraction
of the knowing of the seity, for that is represented by a pure quantum
state that evolves in Hilbert space. Live symbols with the complexity of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>28</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{28}</annotation></semantics></math>
or
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>41</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{41}</annotation></semantics></math>
atoms are astounding, yet they represent small fractions of the number
of entangled qubits that would be necessary to represent the pure state
of a seity expressing herself through such a symbol! According to
D’Ariano’s OPT, it takes many thousands of entangled qubits to describe
an elementary particle and therefore atoms and molecules are extremely
complex informational structures.</p>
<p>If we take seriously what the QIP theory is telling us, we have
before us an undiscovered world of such complexity and wonder that, in
comparison, the recent achievements of artificial intelligence are
little more than toys. Once we accept that consciousness and free will
exist as fundamental properties of nature, our worldview changes
irreversibly and enriches us immensely. This vision restores the purpose
and meaning of the universe denied by classical physics, and is deeply
aligned with the thinking of perennial philosophy which has always
recognized the inestimable value of consciousness and knowing.</p>
<p>This new interpretation, which involves consciousness from the very
beginning and is much broader than what our rational mind has been
telling us, gives us a glimpse of a world still to be explored and
discovered both scientifically and experientially. It was the rational
mind that suggested we are machines because that mind could only
understand how things “function.” Knowing the functioning of things
certainly allows us to design complicated mechanisms, but we are
infinitely more than mathematical “operations”! Each one of us is a
part-whole of One that wants to know the Whole that we carry within.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a seity that communicates with other seities
does not have to know what quantum information in Hilbert space is, just
like we do not have to know Fourier transforms when we converse with
each other. In other words, with the same naturalness with which we
automatically transform the vibrations of the air into a sound and its
meaning, a seity directly perceives the live symbols as an experience,
and can directly translate a portion of its experience into live
symbols.</p>
<h1 id="meaning-is-the-essence-of-knowing">Meaning Is the Essence of
Knowing</h1>
<p>I have a naïve faith in the universe…that at some level everything
makes sense, and we can get glimpses of that sense if we try.<br />
—Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>
<p>Meaning is the essence of the seities’ self-knowing and it is only
partially represented by the live symbols they use to communicate with
each other. We have seen that the coevolution of knowing and live
symbols occurs through the repetition of communication cycles. This
process also produces new seities, new seities’ combinations, new
symbols, and new symbols’ combinations. The laws by which the symbols
manifest and combine are probabilistic, and their meaning is generally
specified by which symbols are chosen (words), and their order
(sentence), as determined by the free-will choices of the seities. This
is typical of any language and is also the profound reason that explains
why quantum laws are probabilistic and indeterministic.</p>
<p>The probability of appearance of each symbol in a sequence is
independent of the meaning expressed. For example, in the sequence of
symbols “the gray cat ate the red mouse,” the probability of each word
is perfectly predicted by the symbolic laws of English. If the sequence
had instead been “the red mouse ate the gray cat,” the same
probabilities would have been observed, but the two meanings would be
quite different.</p>
<p>Note that quantum physics laws, just like the syntactical laws of any
language, predict the probability of appearance of their symbols but not
their order! However, the fact that the probabilities of symbols are
independent from the meaning expressed by them does not mean that the
language is meaningless. Quantum physics can only describe the
probabilistic rules that are necessary, but not sufficient, to express
and explore meaning. But the free-will exploration of meaning cannot be
predicted by any mathematical theory.</p>
<p>The “objects” described by quantum physics are the symbols of a
universal language that manifest in spacetime and represent the
“letters,” “words,” and “phrases” of conscious entities that communicate
with each other. In this context, everything written on paper, or in the
memory of a computer, is made up of classical symbols representing only
the memory of a knowing that is always evolving and is characterized by
a deep and irreducible dynamism.</p>
<p>Before symbols there is the meaning that formed them, and meaning has
much more depth and breadth than any possible symbolic expression might
hope to capture, especially the meaning connected with emotions and
creative thoughts. We are holistic beings, and this is also the reason
why our words have more than one meaning per symbol. Therefore, when we
combine many words in a sentence, the number of possible meanings grows
exponentially with the number of words.4 Therefore, deciding which of
the many meanings is the correct one requires comprehension. Without it,
verbal communications would be impossible. We also comprehend poorly
worded sentences because meaning comes first for us. Comprehension is
also responsible for the creativity that has allowed us to invent
computers and the algorithms that make them useful.</p>
<p>Computers cannot understand ambiguous sentences nor can they program
themselves because they do not comprehend the limitations of algorithms.
There is no path from meaningless symbols to meaning for the same reason
that electrical signals cannot be translated into qualia without
consciousness. Furthermore, each new meaning must be expressed with a
new combination of symbols that never existed before. Syntactical laws
allow such combinations, but they cannot prescribe them because the real
cause of a new combination is the conscious comprehension of a seity
that exists outside the domain of classical symbols.</p>
<p>The widespread idea that the laws of physics can predict all of
physical reality is dead wrong. It would be like saying that the
syntactical laws of English can predict all the new ideas that will be
written in the future. The symbolic laws can only predict that the
symbolic expression of future new ideas will obey them, but cannot
anticipate which ideas will make sense. The driving force behind any new
meaningful combination of symbols is not their syntax, but the
ontological reality of the meaning that created it. For example,
whatever is the meaning of the book I will write in the future, we can
be sure that the letters of the alphabet I will use will obey the
syntactical laws of the language in which such book will be written.
However, symbols alone cannot create new meanings because meaning comes
first. Yet we often value symbols (form) and ignore meaning
(substance).</p>
<p>The probabilistic laws of quantum physics, which describe how
elementary particles combine, work similarly to the syntactical laws of
the symbols of our languages that describe probabilistically how the
letters of the alphabet combine. Likewise, the quantum laws do not
determine the order of the particles and atoms that appear, but only
their probability of appearing, just like the choice of words and their
order in a book is not determined by the syntactical rules of the
language.</p>
<p>Physical reality without new creations would be like having books
written by computers: the syntax would be perfect, but there would be no
new meaning because the computer does not know how to judge meaning. A
computer cannot have new ideas beyond the ones we have inserted into its
algorithms. If an idea produced by a computer seems new to us, it is
only because we had not completely “unrolled” the algorithm that we put
into its program. For example, if we have developed an algorithm to
generate various images of snowflakes by assigning random values to a
number of open parameters, the computer may generate a snowflake so
beautiful that we might believe the computer is an artist! In truth, the
artist was the programmer together with the person who recognized that
the “snowflake” produced by chance by the computer was a work of art.
The computer did not know what it was doing. David Hume said: “The
beauty of things exists in the mind that contemplates them,” and that’s
exactly how it is. It is time to stop attributing human qualities to
what does not have them!</p>
<p>When we think that the ontology of the universe resides only in its
symbols, we describe a meaningless universe. Physics can only grasp the
objective meaning of symbols, just like Shannon’s information does, but
it cannot do any more. On the other hand, seities build symbolic
realities from the inside out, going from conscious meaning to symbols.
And their capacity to go from symbols to meaning depends on their prior
comprehension of the meaning that can only creatively, and not
algorithmically, arise from their consciousness.</p>
<h1 id="information-needs-to-be-redefined">Information Needs to Be
Redefined</h1>
<p>Meaning cannot exist in a physical reality described only by symbols
and symbolic laws without meaning. And this is what current physics
does. In such apparent reality, consciousness, life, and free will are
nothing more than epiphenomena.</p>
<p>In the proposed new worldview, meaning, which is the essence of
knowing, comes before symbols, yet symbols serve the purpose of
communicating and exploring meaning, which is the reason for their
existence. Thus, without meaning there is no reason for symbolic
information to exist. Surprisingly, quantum information describes the
knowing, i.e., the meaning that was excluded in the original definition
of information!</p>
<p>Moreover, the symbolic laws of quantum physics admit the existence of
an extraordinary dynamic symbol that is a living cell. However, that
cell was not “written” by the laws of symbols but by the seities who,
little by little, discovered the “meaning of life” and expressed it with
the same symbols they used to comprehend it. These symbols “obeyed” the
symbolic laws of live information in the construction of the first cell
in the same way that Dante obeyed the syntactical laws of Italian in his
Divine Comedy. However, the symbols were not the blind authors of this
sublime work, nor was it Dante’s physical body who wrote it. The real
author was the embodied seity who chose the most appropriate symbols
(words) and their order to express the meaning she felt, while at the
same time obeying the syntactical laws.</p>
<p>Therefore, to express a complex thought, the choice of words and
their order is determined neither by chance nor by the laws of symbols
but by the meaning the ego/seity desires to express. In fact, the
symbolic laws can only predict the probabilities of the symbols emerging
from seities, but those probabilities have nothing to do with meaning.
Likewise, the ideas of life and computer cannot have emerged from chance
combinations of symbols but from the deeper reality of meaning. The
physical universe which exists in Ispace emerged from C-space, the
semantic space. We must not confuse the symbols with their meaning!
Information exists to communicate meaning, and can only exist if meaning
exists.</p>
<p>Symbols are the physical shareable structures with which the meaning
is collectively expressed and explored by seities and with which
increasingly complex symbols are constructed to express the ever-new
meanings emerging anew from C-space. It is the new meaning that
“informs” the seities on how to construct the new symbols that express
it. Only the intention, comprehension, love, and care of the seities can
sense the potential of an idea not yet fully comprehended, which must be
gradually expressed symbolically through a creative process that will
coevolve symbol-andmeaning.</p>
<p>In this creative process, chance has no important role to play.
Therefore, this idea differs enormously from the natural evolution
doctrine that entrusted to chance the source of creativity we recognize
in the universe. With Oscar Wilde I also think that “chance is simply a
synonym of our ignorance.” Often the artist can probe deeper than the
scientist.</p>
<h1 id="from-observers-to-actors">From Observers to Actors</h1>
<p>In classical physics, probability is used primarily when dealing with
systems made of huge numbers of classical particles obeying
deterministic laws. It is called statistical physics, and the concept of
probability refers to the lack of knowledge of a state that already
exists or has probability 1 to exist later, but is unknown. In this case
the knowledge of the deterministic laws allows us to use a variable to
represent what is certain but unknown. This is the “objective
probability” that can later be averaged and eliminated, allowing the
derivation of another deterministic law valid for the ensemble.5 In
other words, within classical physics, the lack of knowledge is not lack
of existence of what is unknown.</p>
<p>In the case of quantum physics, however, the theory describes only
the information that can be known about reality, not reality. Therefore,
the unknown variable is the probability of what will be measured. This
probability represents something that is inherently uncertain and
unknown, a very different concept than objective probability (the future
state is certain but unknown). This is by some called “subjective
probability” and refers to information that does not yet exist because
the state that will manifest is determined only at the moment and by
effect of the measurement.</p>
<p>We have seen that this state is completely unknowable before the
measurement because it has not been decided yet. In fact, it has been
proven that no hidden variables exist that could determine that state
prior to its decision. Only a free-will decision and/or non-algorithmic
randomness could be its source. Therefore, the probability of quantum
physics represents a genuine creation! And genuine creations cannot be
predicted. Thus quantum physics is the best possible representation of a
creative universe. As such, it cannot predict the future because that
future has not yet been created.</p>
<p>In other words, no one can actually know the state that will be found
when we make a measurement because that state does not literally exist.
Thus quantum probability refers to the lack of existence of what may be
later known. This also explains why the quantum laws can only predict
the probabilities of the possible states that might manifest, but not
the actual state that will occur, because what will show up is
determined by either nonalgorithmic randomness or the free will of some
quantum agent. In both cases, it is not decided by a deterministic
law.</p>
<p>Classical physics purported to describe reality directly only to
discover that it was mistaken, for it only described what our classical
sensory systems or instruments revealed about outer reality, without
recognizing that outer reality emerges from a deeper and more
fundamental reality that cannot be directly known. There are indeed
hidden variables, but those are behind classical physics, not quantum
physics!</p>
<p>I believe that our inability to comprehend quantum physics originates
from a hidden expectation or desire that the universe should be
deterministic instead of creative. This prejudice has caused a
fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of reality, as revealed
through the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. Quantum physics
may account for the past but cannot predict the future of physical
reality because it can only tell us what we can possibly know about the
future.</p>
<p>I think the deep message of quantum physics is that: (1) quantum
information is the representation of the inner experience of quantum
systems, some without and others with free will. That experience can
only be privately known by each quantum system and is the creative
source of outer reality; (2) live information represents the symbolic,
shareable information that can directly communicate a portion of the
private experience of quantum systems to other quantum systems. Live
information can also be organized as living organisms; (3) classical
information is the symbolic, shareable information representable by
statistically significant ensembles of uncorrelated live symbols that
behave deterministically. Classical information cannot be organized as
living organisms. It can only be used to create virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The observer of a classical system is an idealization of someone who
can know the objective state of the system without disturbing it.
Therefore, such an observer can only exist outside the observed system,
like passively watching a movie, because he cannot exist as a cognitive
observer inside a virtual reality. The observer of a quantum system,
instead, cannot observe without drastically disturbing what he observes,
and thus changes it. Therefore, he is not an observer but an actor.
Moreover, no observer can know the state of a quantum system even in
principle since quantum information cannot be reproduced. Quantum
physics is therefore telling us that there are only actors!</p>
<p>The notion of observer in physics has to be eliminated and replaced
with the notion of quantum actors because inside a quantum universe
there can only be quantum actors. And quantum actors are conscious,
according to QIP, and interact with other quantum actors which are also
conscious. Therefore the entities that interact within a quantum
universe are like the thoughtforms and the seities that I have
postulated and described. I recall that thoughtforms are quantum systems
that are conscious but do not have free will and thus do not have an
identity, whereas seities are self-conscious entities that have an
indelible identity and free will. Obviously, there may be many other
types of quantum actors, for now unexplored, since the notion of quantum
actor has not been fully explored.</p>
<h1 id="lived-knowing-1">Lived Knowing</h1>
<p>Beauty is life when life reveals itself. Beauty is eternity that is
contemplated in the mirror, and we are eternity and the mirror. —Kahlil
Gibran</p>
<p>The initial goal of science was to explain natural phenomena, not
life or consciousness. When scientists convinced themselves that
mathematics alone could give us a detailed description of reality and
that our sense-based intuition was fallacious, the ideas that life is
mechanical, consciousness is epiphenomenal, and free will does not exist
became widespread. This is exactly like saying that the universe is
without meaning and purpose. Moreover, some even proposed that the
mathematical description of reality is reality, i.e. that mathematics is
ontological, even though it is a creation of our human minds.</p>
<p>It is good to remember that Galileo said that mathematics is the
language of nature, not that the language of nature is nature. But today
there is an increasing tendency to believe that reality is made up of
meaningless symbols. But how can empty symbols replace lived
experiences? For example, the word “compassion” cannot replace the
“experience of compassion.” True compassion is the “descent into shared
suffering” (Pope Gregory the Great). The meaning is in the lived
experience, not in the words or other classical symbols that represent
it, and the experience belongs only to those who live it.</p>
<h1 id="rationality-is-not-enough">Rationality Is Not Enough</h1>
<p>Reason is nothing without imagination. —Descartes</p>
<p>The need for ever more complex mathematics to describe our world has
increasingly distanced us from our lived experiences—the only true
source of knowing—and led us to consider rationality the only mental
capacity useful in the study of reality. For example, we have tried to
understand quantum physics using only our rational minds without the
creative inputs of intuition, emotion, and imagination. If quantum
physics primarily describes the interiority of reality, as I propose,
mathematics alone can never lead us to the necessary comprehension.
Quantum physics is homomorphic to the qualities of our inner experience,
not the measured physical quantities of the symbolic classical
world.</p>
<p>Interiority is represented by a pure quantum state that cannot be
reproduced and can only be known by its owner “from within” in the form
of qualia. Such experience, being subjective and private, can never be
symbolically transmitted in an objective way. Its description using
classical symbols will always be an approximation, for the inner
structure of meaning contains a portion that will remain ambiguous and
undecidable even within the conscious experience itself, as we all know
so well.</p>
<p>I am convinced that our intuitive mind and emotions have access to a
fundamental meaning that can lead us to the truth when guided and
combined with all our other capacities, which include rationality of
course, but a rationality inspired by the heart. If it is true that One
wants to know Itself, it would be inconsistent to think that we, as
seities, lack the capacity to do so. By not trusting our intuition and
our heart, we tend to mainly use our rationality. However, for as long
as our knowing remains only at the symbolic level, it will only be
knowledge, and cannot be complete. When we say “It is so because
mathematics says so,” without going beyond the operational understanding
of what mathematics is telling us, it means that we have stopped at the
surface of things. Facts and rationality are only the first step,
absolutely necessary for sure, but not sufficient for full
comprehension.</p>
<p>By stating that the universe is open, I mean that any algorithmic
description of reality can only be approximate and incomplete, and that
it will never be possible to know the whole future. Believing that the
future can be described by calculating the limit to infinity of an
algorithm is not possible, in my opinion, because, if everything is
interconnected, there cannot be separate algorithms that describe
separate portions of reality.</p>
<p>This is also the lesson we learn from chaotic systems, where a tiny
difference in the initial conditions of two otherwise identical systems
leads in the long run to a macroscopic and unpredictable difference
between the two. If everything is interconnected, there must be tiny
connections among all the algorithms that collectively describe the
Whole. These connections will change the behavior of each isolated
algorithm and will take it beyond its mathematical definition.
Therefore, even though these connections can be initially neglected,
they can later produce a completely different behavior from the one
expected by the algorithms in isolation, well before reaching
infinity.</p>
<p>Infinity is unthinkable, because the portion that remains outside any
finite part is infinitely greater than that part, no matter its size. In
mathematics, many of our most important results have been achieved by
calculating the limit to infinity of a series (an algorithm). Since
reality is all interconnected, the various mathematical theories that we
should use to describe it should also be all interconnected, i.e., each
theory should be able to influence the others, even though to a small
degree.</p>
<p>Our total reliance on mathematics as a tool to describe a holistic
reality, especially with regard to mathematical extrapolations to
infinity, must be reconsidered in the light of the holism revealed by
quantum physics. Mathematics is a valid mental construction, yet, if it
is made of separable parts, it cannot possibly describe a holistic
reality. The fact that pure quantum states are not knowable “from the
outside” is already an extraordinary result, which indicates the secret
connections of mathematics with a non-algorithmic, open, and unknowable
universe. The mathematics of physics cannot erase the mystery of a
universe that evolves based on free will. It is likely that our need for
power and control may subtly drive us to believe that we can know the
future that even One does not know.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-rationality">Beyond Rationality</h1>
<p>As André Weil observed in his Apprenticeship Memories: “Mathematics
is just one of the many mirrors in which truth is reflected, albeit
perhaps with more purity than in other mirrors.” However, it was not
mathematics that created our world, and therefore there must be deeper
reasons for the world to reflect so well in the mathematical models we
have invented/discovered. Such reasons can only be found by studying
ourselves and investigating who we really are, since we are also the
inventors of these models. After all, each of us carries within the
“genome” of One.</p>
<p>To comprehend our true nature, the computational and mechanistic
models that are rapidly gaining the upper hand in the sciences are not
sufficient. Not even logic alone is sufficient, though necessary. We
also need the other aspects of our nature, such as our emotions,
imagination, creativity, courage, empathy, free will, curiosity, and the
incredible capacity to comprehend through our lived experiences. If each
of us reflects the whole, our knowing must also include these
non-algorithmic properties, which go far beyond the purely rational
knowledge we rely upon almost exclusively today. I am convinced that if
we disconnect from these fundamental aspects that distinguish us from
our machines, we run the great risk of becoming machines ourselves, not
by nature, but by choice.</p>
<p>We have also seen that there is no trace of meaning in the
probabilistic symbolic laws of our languages, and the same is true in
the language of matter, i.e., the language of classical symbols.
However, the existence of meaning is evident for each of us in our
conscious experience, and is reflected in the subjective nature of
quantum probability and in the nature of the pure states that we have
discussed. Moreover, the expression of meaning is not governed by any
physical laws, and therefore the laws cannot describe the lived
experience, which is what matters most to us and to all the innumerable
seities created by One. I believe this is also the reason why quantum
laws must be expressed with subjective probabilities that do not allow
us to know ahead of a measurement which symbol will show up, because
that symbol is decided by free will and not by an algorithm.</p>
<p>As Albert Einstein states: “It is possible that everything can be
described scientifically, but it would not make sense; it would be as if
we were describing a Beethoven symphony as a variation in the pressures
of the waves.” For sure, a piece of music is not just the musical score
and the frequency spectrum of the air vibrations: “The music is not in
the notes, the music is between the notes” (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart).
The Music is also the subtle meaning contained in the emotions and the
joy it brings, not to mention the pleasure of reproducing it with our
own voice or with an instrument, if you are so lucky as to be able to do
it. The objective structure and characteristics of a piece of music are
not enough to describe the lived experience of it, which is enriched
immeasurably when you play it with other musicians you love to be with.
That is a cooperative work of art and discipline.</p>
<p>Music as physical vibrations is only its symbolic dimension. The
experience of music is its semantic dimension, and the two can be
conceived as the indivisible and correlated faces of the same creation.
Music, together with speech, provides us with a striking example of the
close link that exists between the inner and the outer worlds. “Where
words fail…music speaks” (Ludwig van Beethoven). And, “Music is perhaps
the only example of what could have been—if it had not been for the
invention of language, the formation of words, and the analysis of
ideas—the communication of souls” (Marcel Proust, The Prisoner).</p>
<h1 id="a-new-interpretation-of-physical-reality">A New Interpretation
of Physical Reality</h1>
<p>I think that a complete theory of information should start from the
general principle that the purpose of information is to communicate
meaning, even though we didn’t think so 75 years ago when Shannon wrote
his famous article [12]. The principle of “correspondence of meaning
with quantum information” expressed by the QIP theory fundamentally
changes the interpretation of quantum physics, and therefore our ideas
about the nature of reality. I think that what we have imagined as a
blind evolution based on chance has instead always been guided “from
within” by seities.</p>
<p>It was not the physical laws that formed the universe; these are
instead the result or effect of the progressive self-knowing of the
seities reflected in the syntactical laws of the symbols they used to
explore and memorize their ever-growing self-knowing. These laws result
from the cooperation of the seities and from the dynamic order inherent
in the nature of One as reflected in each of them.</p>
<p>In vain we tried to explain consciousness as an emergent property of
unconscious matter. The QIP theory now fully supports the idea that what
we have conceived as matter is an emergent property of conscious quantum
systems (seities), not the other way around, since pure quantum states
have all the characteristics of conscious experiences, and classical
physics emerged from live information, which in turn emerged from
quantum information. This implies that consciousness cannot be explained
with any simpler concepts than itself because it always existed. It is
spacetime and matter-energy that can be explained with consciousness,
because consciousness has always been guiding the evolution of the
universe.</p>
<p>In this new worldview, matter reflects the symbolic aspect of
conscious entities that communicate meaning with each other. Symbols and
meaning are the two irreducible aspects of a holistic reality.</p>
<p>At some point the place of honor that belonged to meaning has been
given to symbols, together with the idea that the laws of symbols must
predict all of reality. This is profoundly misguided because symbols
alone will never be able to predict the evolution of meaning that is
open and creative. The current laws of physics can only predict that the
symbolic expression of any new meaning will not be contradictory with
the symbolic expression of any previous meaning. However, new meaning
may create new laws since meaning is not algorithmic, and the complex
symbols needed to represent it are just as creative and unknowable prior
to the emergence of the new meaning.</p>
<p>For example, the laws of physics did not predict the invention of the
computer. The computer is simply a human creation, allowed by the laws
of physics, but originating from the imagination, creativity, love of
knowledge, and commitment that has always inspired and guided us from
within.</p>
<p>Meaning, Live Information, and Classical Information The discoveries
that have required the development of quantum physics have subverted the
classical worldview and, so far, have been impossible to interpret
correctly. However, it is essential to fully comprehend the message of
quantum physics to make further progress. Shannon information is the
cologarithm of the probability of classical symbols that can be used to
represent the meaning that conscious agents have agreed, though there is
no connection between symbol and meaning in its definition. The
existence of meaning only makes sense if there are conscious observers
interacting with free will. And, as we have discussed, these observers
cannot exist in the classical world.</p>
<p>The homomorphism that exists between live information and pure
quantum states (meaning) does not exist in classical information, for it
has been averaged away in the uncorrelated live symbols that constitute
the deterministic classical matter. Since classical symbols emerge from
live symbols and live symbols emerge from quantum information, we can
clearly say that the origin of classical, objective, and public
information is the subjective meaning represented by the private quantum
information.</p>
<p>When physicists tell us that the probabilities of quantum events are
objective and therefore reality has no subjective meaning, this is just
like saying that a human language has no meaning because the
probabilities of its symbols are objective. Well, we know that our
languages exist to communicate meaning and therefore the syntactical
laws must leave the expression of meaning unregulated. Thus, the fact
that quantum physics is structured like the syntactical laws of a
language strongly validates the hypotheses that physical laws evolved
over time, and that quantum information represents the “meaning of
information” that is missing from Shannon information.</p>
<p>At the end of the previous chapter I concluded that the observers in
quantum physics should be banned and replaced by actors that are
integral parts of the universe and whose observations, experiences, and
actions affect both the universe and them. A fundamental class of actors
are the seities that communicate with each other using live symbols. As
their knowing increases, live symbols get ever more complex until they
reach the level of a living cell. With the invention of living cells the
seities could then create virtual worlds made of classical symbols in
which they could have novel experiences that gradually became ever more
engrossing, and led to the creation of multicellular life.</p>
<p>Multicellular organisms become able to experience fully immersive
virtual worlds like the one we are currently experiencing. These
organisms transform live symbols within their cells into the classical
symbols necessary for their body to act in the world of macroscopic
objects. The transformations from classical to live symbols are also
performed by living organisms to communicate the “reality” of the
classical world to the seities.</p>
<p>Classical symbols are like the ink droplets with which books are
printed, or like the bits of our computers. But the reason why books and
computers exist is to allow embodied conscious entities to experience
the near-infinite possible worlds that can be cocreated and explored to
better know themselves through knowing each other.</p>
<h1 id="ideas-come-before-symbols">Ideas Come before Symbols</h1>
<p>The vase can break, but its pattern will continue to exist in the
mind. —Tibetan proverb</p>
<p>To create an invention, we need to start from an idea. However, the
idea is not enough by itself. Only if it is sufficiently articulated can
the inventor begin to build the object of his invention. Through the
construction of the object, the inventor refines his idea, which in turn
allows him to refine the construction (another example of a “snake
biting its tail”).</p>
<p>It took millennia to invent the computers with which we now can
interact with virtual realities of our own creation. The computer was
not born by chance, but through a conscious process of exploration,
comprehension, and realization that started from a conscious idea that
already existed in its embryonic form long before its realization.
Likewise, any creation must always start from a general idea before
arriving at any specific realization, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>Note that the idea is often born from a desire. For example, the
desire to fly must have emerged within human consciousness at the time
of the hominids, presumably by observing birds and imagining the joy of
being able to fly like them. It took hundreds of thousands of years to
gradually develop the technologies and the knowledge needed to build an
aircraft. The first flight on a fragile contraption took place in 1903.
In 1947, the sound barrier was broken, and in 1969 humans landed on the
moon!</p>
<p>However, the aircrafts that exist today are not the result of random
combinations of matter that self-organized naturally “from the outside”
without any idea of the intended whole. They are instead due to the
desire, intention, imagination, courage, and tenacity—inner skills—of
generations of human beings who gradually achieved the goals they had
envisioned and set for themselves.</p>
<p>In the physical world there is a tendency toward disorder that is
encoded in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In current science, the
principle of random variation and selection is the only creative
principle allowed to explain the natural evolution of complex systems.
This is certainly a valid principle, but only if among the random
variations there is at least one that is “fitter” than the ones that
previously existed in the pool of variations. Otherwise, there is
nothing better to select.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, we randomly change the state of a bit in a
computer program. What is the probability of improving the program?
Almost zero. It would already be great if the computer continued to
properly function. Suppose that to significantly improve a program, it
is necessary to change 100 bits in the right place. If we randomly
change 100 bits and the probability that each bit contributes to an
improvement is
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1\%</annotation></semantics></math>
(an extremely optimistic value if the program has more than 10,000
bits), the final probability would be (0.01)100, a value so small that
producing an improvement by chance would be practically impossible.</p>
<p>We certainly make improvements through a process of variation and
selection, for which reason the principle is valid, but in our case each
variation, even if only in our thoughts, is the best idea we have,
already knowing the function we want to achieve, and what we need to
improve. Random or accidental thoughts are immediately discarded by our
conscious comprehension. Despite all this, the selection made by the
“market of ideas,” which plays the same role as the ecosystem, discards
many of our ideas, including those we believed were good. This is why we
have been able to create and improve airplanes and computers over
time.</p>
<p>To make these ideas more understandable, let’s consider a concrete
example: in England in the 1690s there were many flooded coal mines
containing a large potential supply of coal. Freeing them from the water
using animal force alone was a long and tiring job. There was a need to
solve that problem and there were also technologies sufficiently
developed to get the job done. It was known, for example, that steam
could be used as a propulsive power, and this led Thomas Savery to
invent, build, and sell the first commercial steam-powered pump in 1698.
This was the spark that ignited the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The invention of the steam pump, which may seem trivial today, had to
be first conceived in its entirety to guide from top to bottom the
visualization of the parts needed, their interactions, and finally their
physical realization and assembly. The overall meaning of the invention
was already contained in Savery’s imagination in the moment he first
conceived of the idea. Later, he had to translate an overall image into
appropriate mental symbols by visualizing the entire functioning and
assembly of the machine. This process of analysis and synthesis may have
been repeated many times, starting and guided from that initial
intuitive spark.</p>
<p>This mental simulation is generally aided by some symbolic processing
performed on paper, and typically ends with a plan that is then
translated into a physical structure that works. Such a plan, even if it
did not physically exist, should exist in some form in the inventor’s
consciousness.</p>
<p>From the outside, the whole seems to emerge from the bottom up, as
the parts are formed and assembled. But the whole had to exist as an
idea before the parts were shaped and then assembled.</p>
<p>The same process also applies to life. It is absurd to think that
simple organic molecules, which represent an infinitesimal fraction of
the complexity of the simplest known bacterium, could naturally
self-assemble to form an organism capable of reproduction without any
guidance and any idea of the intended result. If simple organic
molecules were like the transistors in our computers, the simplest
bacterium would be like a microscopic robot made of ten billion
transistors, including the “software” needed to make it function
autonomously and reproduce.</p>
<p>How can we expect the first living and self-reproducing cell to have
emerged by chance, without the prior existence of a conscious and
intentional idea? How can a hierarchy of precise subsystems
self-assemble and form a living organism of incredible complexity
through natural and random events that have a natural tendency to
disorder? We know that despite knowing the intended result, already
possessing all the necessary atoms and molecules, and having the most
advanced tools, no bioengineer would be able today to assemble a
functioning bacterium. The origin of life is a miraculous event! If a
computer were to miraculously self-assemble through natural events, that
miracle would be puny compared to the first one, since the complexity of
a computer is insignificant compared to that of a bacterium. Yet, many
insist that “nature” has done this miracle with her eyes closed and
without knowing what she wanted? That nature would be more powerful than
God!</p>
<p>Just like One created us, we collectively “invented” and developed
biological life and the human brain in step with our comprehension and
to help improve it. Yet our scientists expect nature to use a mindless
method to create mind. I think that every creation begins from an
overall idea motivated by a desire. Combining the idea with the will and
the means to pursue its realization, we can gradually arrive at its
working implementation through a process of variation and selection. No
creative structure like a machine or a cell is realizable without a
conscious intuition of what is wanted. How can a living cell
self-assemble as a result of natural processes without any idea of what
is intended?</p>
<p>In my way of thinking, and consistently with the QIP principles, the
first living cell did not self-assemble by chance but was instead the
result of the enormous collective creativity and knowing of the seities.
Moved by the need to comprehend the existence of the self-reproduction
with which they were created and were themselves creating, the seities
may have been able to cooperatively manipulate the live symbols of their
language to the point of gradually developing a new symbol capable of
self-reproduction! The first living cell! We have used the same method
employed by the seities to create airplanes and microchips. And we have
now reached a level of comprehension that will soon allow us to make
machines that can automatically assemble other machines, though using
classical information rather than live information. We have worked like
them for the simple reason that we are them!</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-life">What Is the Purpose of Life?</h1>
<p>We are all visitors of this time and place. We’re just passing
through. Our job here is to observe, learn, grow and love…Then we go
back home. —Aboriginal Australian proverb</p>
<p>We have seen that our consciousness allows us to tune into the
“vibration sphere” of the reality we want to live and know, and that
direct knowing implies “becoming” what we experience. During our first
year of life, when the rational mind was not yet developed, we learned
to tune into the signals produced by the body. Through this process, the
ego emerged as that small portion of our greater consciousness that
believes itself to be the body, oversees it, and comprehends the
situations in which the body operates. The ego also supervises the
automatic learning of our brain, so that we can properly learn to
recognize new situations, often with just one example.</p>
<p>The ability to learn, and therefore recognize a new complex situation
with one or a few examples, is one of the striking differences between
human and artificial intelligence (AI). Consciousness comprehends first
and then forms new quantum correlations to symbolically represent the
new meaning, whereas a machine can only find classical correlations by
mechanically processing many examples of the same situation. In ordinary
reality nearly all circumstances are unique, and we are the ones with
the comprehension to decide which situation to call “the same as before”
or “a new one.” An AI program cannot learn a new pattern with just one
example because it does not have the non-algorithmic comprehension that
alone can tell it that such a situation is new and what is new about it.
Hence, AI’s versatility is much less than that of humans. On the other
hand, AI can do much better than us in most repetitive problems. AI is
actually complementary to human capabilities. If used well, it will be a
great advantage for humanity; if used poorly, it could even create
existential problems.</p>
<p>In other words, the immeasurable and unbridgeable difference between
human and artificial intelligence lies in the ability to comprehend of
the ego/seity; a quantum property that is not accessible to digital
computers. But there is more to human intelligence, because it not only
makes use of the superb non-algorithmic comprehension and the
information processing performed by the “head,” but also uses the
creativity, motivation, and courageous action that come metaphorically
from the “heart” and the “gut.” These metaphorical centers are not
separable from each other, and collaborate because true human
intelligence is the combination of head, heart, and gut. The head is the
mental, the heart is the emotional, and the gut is the physical or
action aspect of a seity. This metaphor will be further discussed
later.</p>
<p>We are incarnated seities, a still-mysterious combination of seity
and physical body. This arrangement greatly complicates our
comprehension of both our algorithmic and non-algorithmic aspects. Much
of what we ordinarily do can be explained by the “mechanisms” of the
body, even though the body is quantum and classical, and therefore far
more sophisticated than a computer. Occasionally we behave like a seity,
at other times like a machine, and almost always like a combination of
the two. It is therefore quite difficult to distinguish between the two
aspects at the current state of our comprehension of reality, especially
given the materialistic prejudices still dominating our worldview.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter, I mentioned that our body is like a
quantumclassical “drone” controlled by the ego. The ego can also direct
a classical drone through the intermediation of his body. He can do the
same with an avatar that is part of a virtual reality created by a
computer. The avatar is an example of a symbolic reality entirely
constructed out of classical symbols though existing within a greater
symbolic reality made of live symbols. This situation suggests the
possibility that there may be additional levels of nested realities. Our
psychological masks, of which there are several, one inside the other,
are another example of nested realities through which we conceal our
deepest intentions, often even from ourselves.</p>
<p>I think the purpose of life is to get to know ourselves through the
knowing of each other, and this also involves knowing our shadow areas.
Here I speak of hatred, racism, violence, and above all, the need to be
superior to others.</p>
<p>For logical consistency with the proposed model, I believe that
shadow areas must also exist within One, albeit in a far more abstract
form, representing inevitable gaps and distortions in the process of
self-knowing that occurs through the seities. I imagine that these
distortions occur because the self-knowing must rely on live and
classical symbols that cannot reveal the full meaning of the experience.
Moreover, to comprehend, the ego needs to already understand a meaning
similar to the one intended by the sender. This requirement can lead to
misunderstandings, the result of which is what we call “evil.” Just like
it happens with human communications, the encoding and decoding of the
symbols cannot be perfect. The impossibility of creating a one-to-one
correspondence between meaning and symbols among seities is the
fundamental cause of distortions.</p>
<p>One of the main purposes of physical life, then, could be to
understand the origin and the “shape” of the distortions that exist
within each of us, a prerequisite for eliminating them. In other words,
evil does not exist as a fundamental reality, but only as a distortion
of reality—a misunderstanding that is not reality. Thus, its elimination
reveals the native reality that is free of any “evil.” Part of this
“purification process” needs to take place through experiences lived in
virtual realities, allowing us to discover and experience the unknown
origin and the nature of the misunderstandings we accidentally carry
within us.</p>
<p>According to this interpretation, our earthly life corresponds to a
“session in a simulator” designed to reveal and dissolve our distortions
through a deep comprehension of our desires and intentions. In the
simulator, the ego controls a “character,” the physical body, with
characteristics that allow the seity, the greater entity we are, to see
clearly the nature of the problem manifested through the free-will
actions of the ego. Once the problem has been identified, the seity may
become aware of deeper intentions and desires that have determined the
ego’s choices, since the ego shares the essence of the seity. This
strategy allows the seity to trace back and remove the underlying causes
of her own misunderstandings.</p>
<p>This process of “amplification of distortions” is fundamental,
because it makes them visible through the consequences they cause within
human society. In fact, we all know that to solve a problem we must
first recognize it and accept it as ours, and this is often the hardest
part. And then, “The moment we accept our problems, the doors of
solutions open wide” (Jalal alDin Rumi). Thus, little by little, the ego
realizes that the reality in which he exists is not the deepest reality;
and comprehends—by experiencing it—that he is more than the body. This
type of experience is necessary to free the ego from the self-induced
trance of believing itself to be the body. This is also the reason why
our intellectual-only understanding of reality is not enough to free
us.</p>
<p>The opportunity to experience that there is a vaster reality than
what appears to our physical senses can also be obtained through a
particularly vivid lucid dream,1 or through some extraordinary
experiences of consciousness, as long as one has developed an
open-enough mind to take those experiences seriously and critically.</p>
<h1 id="the-evolution-of-scientific-thought">The Evolution of Scientific
Thought</h1>
<p>Each new theory is first attacked as absurd; it is later recognized
as true, but obvious and insignificant; finally, it is considered so
important that its adversaries claim to have discovered it
themselves.</p>
<p>—William James</p>
<p>After having analyzed for a long time the fundamental parts of which
physical reality is made, a small portion of humanity is ready to move
away from the materialism of classical physics to the new holistic
vision offered by quantum information. Quantum information is compatible
with the existence of a profound spiritual dimension of reality that in
the past has fueled myths and religions. In fact, we are beginning to
realize that the behavior of the whole cannot be explained only by the
behavior of its parts, because reality, unlike what we imagined, is not
made of separate parts and is not as objective as we thought. The Tao Te
Ching starts with this verse:</p>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.</p>
<p>This is the poetic description of:</p>
<p>The symbol (classical information) that can be told<br />
is not the eternal Meaning (quantum information that cannot be
reproduced).</p>
<p>Quantum physics has revealed that the smaller the parts, the more
inseparable from the whole they become, and therefore the whole must be
invisibly present in all of its macroscopic parts. Nothing is closed and
separated from the Whole, and even the most abstract symbol of quantum
reality—the simplest of which we have called a qubit—is information of a
special kind, because it remains intimately connected (entangled) with
the other qubits it interacts with.</p>
<p>This is also the crucial property of our semantic, inner, and private
reality that cannot be explained abstractly because the meaning can only
be intimately known by those who experience it subjectively within
themselves. This ultimate reality is not algorithmic and reproducible
and has been so far neglected by science in the belief that everything
that exists must be objective. This prejudice has eliminated from
existence the very essence of the universe. To comprehend and appreciate
who we are, we must embrace and integrate our physical, emotional,
intuitive, and spiritual aspects into a lived whole.</p>
<h1 id="three-fundamental-centers">Three Fundamental Centers</h1>
<p>Everyone says that the brain is the most complex organ in the human
body; as a doctor I might even agree. But as a woman I assure you that
there is nothing more complex than the heart; even today all its
mechanisms are not known. If there is logic in the reasoning of the
brain, there are emotions in the reasoning of the heart.</p>
<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini</p>
<p>The metaphor, “We are a whole made of heart, head, and gut,” serves
to describe the type of union that I experienced in the awakening
described in the Introduction. I believe it is necessary to integrate
and harmonize the “head” with the “heart” and the “gut,” i.e., the
intuitive and rational thinking with our deepest unitive feelings and
with our capacity for courageous and right action. These three centers
are metaphorical, of course, and are neither separate nor separable,
because each of them also contains a portion of the other two.
Therefore, even an intellectual person who appears to only live inside
his head cannot be completely disconnected from his heart and gut.</p>
<p>If we examine the head center, we can recognize that the intuitive
and creative powers are our highest mental abilities. We also possess a
rational mind, i.e., the ability to reason logically on the basis of the
presumed validity of assumptions (both explicit and implicit). The
choice of assumptions, however, is mainly based on the level of our
conscious comprehension of the whole. Finally, we also have a mechanical
aspect, i.e., the ability to recognize patterns and to learn and follow
procedures, just like computers that use artificial neural networks (we
have copied those networks from the brains of mammals). For example,
after the brain has learned to drive a car under the ego’s supervision,
we can then drive using mainly these quasiautonomous and automatic
learned processes.</p>
<p>As for the heart, it is the center of our feelings, desires,
intentions, empathy, love, joy, passion, curiosity, honesty, ethics, and
self-fulfillment. Its highest expression is unitive, because no
fundamental distinction exists in reality between the observer and the
observed when all the “parts” are partswhole. At the level of our
ordinary experience, our feelings are generally neither too strong nor
particularly vivid, though they are aware and present. Finally, there is
the “mechanical” aspect of the heart, represented by the
quasi-automatic, habitual emotions and feelings that have limited
awareness and depth, and include the usual sensations of shape, color,
sounds, smells, and tastes associated with the physical world.
Therefore, the experience of the heart ranges from the habitual
semi-automatic level of ordinary feelings to the occasionally vivid and
extraordinary feelings enlightened by the sense of unity, love, and
fulfillment.</p>
<p>The gut is the focus of our physical actions, and it is the least
understood of our centers. Its mechanical aspect is expressed by those
physical acts that we perform almost unconsciously, for example, when we
walk or ride a bike. The next level contains ordinary, intentional, and
free-will actions. Finally, the highest level includes behaviors guided
by deep comprehension, ethics, love, and courage; thus they contain the
comprehension of what is right, the love that comes from the heart, and
the courage and determination of the gut to act with integrity. The
union of the heart with the head and gut is manifested in just, loving,
and courageous actions. Sometimes these must go against the interests of
the individual, to the point of putting property, reputation, or even
life at risk, in order to honor the universal values that are deeply
felt and cannot be shortchanged.</p>
<p>Head, heart, and gut may also refer to three different types of
knowing, because we can learn mentally, emotionally, and interactively.
The interactive knowing is based on physical action, knowing “from
without” by interacting with objects and observing the actions of
others, just like an apprentice learns by observing and imitating his
master, or the scientist learns by doing experiments.</p>
<p>Emotional knowing is mainly knowing “from within,” based on the
sensations and feelings (qualia) we experience by observing the world
and ourselves. At the ordinary level, this experiential and empathic
knowing can lead us to superficial judgments, while at a highest level,
when the knowing is direct, it makes us become what we know. Direct
knowing also involves mental knowing and inspires right and courageous
actions.</p>
<p>Mental knowing is knowing “both from without and from within.” We get
the first kind by reading and studying books, for example, or by
listening to parents, teachers, and the media. We get the other one
through the comprehension and creativity that is based on intuition and
imagination. Symbolic knowledge from without and semantic knowing from
within represent the ordinary aspects of mental knowing, while knowing
“from within” based on creativity and comprehension is instead the
superior aspect of mental knowing.</p>
<p>We actually know through the integration of all three ways of
knowing, because it is impossible to separate them.2</p>
<p>A robot possesses only the mechanical aspects of both mental and
interactive knowledge, and it completely lacks the knowing that comes
from the heart and represents the essence of the non-algorithmic and
unified aspects of knowing that markedly distinguish us from robots. If
we only had the mechanical aspects, we would also be machines. Instead,
our ordinary mind integrates the mechanical aspect of understanding with
the ideation, creativity, and comprehension that only comes from the
higher mind. Our full mind is then united with the love, joy, passion,
and compassion that come from the heart and with the courage,
leadership, and right action that come from the gut.</p>
<p>Those who have lived a unified experience open up much more to the
knowing and creativity of the seity to which they belong, and this leads
to a noticeable improvement of their creative abilities, and to a deeper
union of the head and gut with the heart. The heart is the deepest
source of our human, non-algorithmic capacities. And “Whoever goes to
the end of his heart knows the nature of man. Knowing one’s human nature
means knowing the sky” (Mencius).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If the stars are unreachable<br />
this is no reason not to want them…<br />
How sad the paths<br />
if it were not for<br />
the magical presence of the stars.<br />
—Mário Quintana, Dreamers of a New Humanity</p>
<p>How sad and how dark are the paths of life if they are not
illuminated by the magical presence of consciousness! Using metaphorical
language, we can clearly say that consciousness is the North Star that
guides us through the paths of life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the consciousness of a large part of humanity is
nowadays immersed in a self-induced trance that obscures Love, which is
the fundamental Law that governs and connects all the parts-whole of the
universe: “the love that moves the sun and the other stars” (Dante
Alighieri). That is likely the same universal love that I felt in the
awakening experience, the love that opened my heart and revealed for the
first time the existence of direct knowing.</p>
<p>The heart is the symbolic center of intentions, emotions, and
intuitions that informs and unites the head (rationality and creativity)
and the gut (courageous and right action), allowing us to achieve
“virtue and knowing,” in Dante’s words again. Only the heart makes it
possible to unite the inner and the outer worlds so that being and
knowing become one; a world in which science and spirituality will
finally be able to integrate, allowing humankind to comprehend what love
is by becoming love and joy and peace: “The ultimate meaning of
everything that surrounds us…is the joy that is the source of all
creation” (Rabindranath Tagore). And that is what ultimately
matters.</p>
<h1 id="knowing-must-be-lived">Knowing Must Be Lived</h1>
<p>Discursive knowledge does not serve to go beyond the illusions of the
world, just as darkness does not cease to exist just by mentioning a
lamp. —Kularnava Tantra</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge, whose object of study is the outer world that
can be known through the measurement of physical quantities and their
mathematical relationships, is absolutely necessary, but it is not
enough to lead us to lived knowing. In my thinking, the ultimate goal of
knowing—to which science has made a fundamental contribution—is realized
only when the observer lives the experience of himself and of the world
in an integrated way, because true knowing goes way beyond knowledge,
the symbolic aspect of reality.</p>
<p>At the peak of lived knowing, the seity becomes one with her own
experience, just like we, as children, identified ourselves with the
games we were playing to such an extent that we became the game. It is
important to underscore that the nature of the “scientific” observer who
limits himself to making accurate measurements, remaining detached and
dispassionate from what he observes, is quite different from the nature
of the actor-observer who “knows what he lives and lives what he knows.”
The first does not feel part of the observed phenomenon since he assumes
that the world is a machine that obeys mathematical laws, whereas the
second participates—gut, heart, and head—in the cocreation of the
reality that he observes, acts on, is acted on by, and fully lives. As
such, he deeply knows that he is responsible for his own experience.</p>
<p>Blaming others for what ails us is how we keep ourselves from
recognizing our responsibility as cocreators of our own experience and
that of others. When our mind, obscured by the desire to be special,
includes everybody else but us in the list of cocreators of our
experience, we prevent ourselves from recognizing the special way in
which we feel superior to them and to the rest of Nature. We must wake
up from this selective consciousness and comprehend that we are Nature
and that Nature is within us. I believe that feeling superior to Nature
is the primary source of our distortions, and the root cause of our
suffering. In my experience, becoming aware of our primary
responsibility about what happens in our experience is the first
fundamental and indispensable step on the road of healing, because our
awakening depends on this crucial self-awareness.1</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge can only tell us what is factual and possible.
However, to make the right decisions, we cannot rely only on science; we
must also add the comprehension and the values that only the heart can
give us—values like those that filled Immanuel Kant with emotion and
wonder: “Two things fill the soul with ever new and growing admiration
and veneration…the starry sky above me, and the moral law within me.”
Without these values, man counts for nothing.</p>
<p>Rita Levi-Montalcini said that:</p>
<p>The absolute evil of our time is not to believe in values. It does
not matter whether they are religious or secular. Young people must
believe in something positive and life deserves to be lived only if we
believe in values, because these remain even after our death.</p>
<h1 id="the-biggest-obstacle-to-union-is-the-need-for-superiority">The
Biggest Obstacle to Union Is the Need for Superiority</h1>
<p>There is nothing noble in being superior to another man. True
nobility lies in being superior to the person we were until yesterday.
—Hindu proverb</p>
<p>The World can only be known when it is observed, acted, and lived,
for we are an integral part of the World and the World is also within
us. The reason we limit ourselves to looking at the World only from the
outside, as if we were not part of it, may be because we feel superior
to it. And this need is also implicit in the principle of the survival
of the fittest that allows us to blame Nature and others for our lack of
love and respect for others. I think we do so mainly because we feel—and
want to be—superior and special.</p>
<p>I consider this “wanting to be the first” the hardest obstacle to
achieving union, especially since in our society strong competition is
considered a desirable thing. In fact, the entire economy, public
education, our sports, and most institutions rely primarily on strong
competition. The evolution of the species is also exclusively attributed
to win-lose competition through the “survival of the fittest” principle
that provides a natural justification for our selfishness and
aggression.</p>
<p>I should point out here that there is a type of friendly competition
that is indeed desirable and promotes personal excellence when it
stimulates in us the desire to be “superior to the person we were until
yesterday,” rather than the desire to win to show that we are better
than the others. Friendly competition, however, can easily become
win-lose competition, especially when the attention of the press or the
people we care about goes only to the winner.</p>
<p>At the basis of competition is the need to feel “special,” which
almost every human being feels. Each of us is indeed special because
each of us is unique and unrepeatable, that special point of view or
perspective with which One knows Itself. The problem arises when one
wants to be more special or more unique than all the other points of
view of One. This need for superiority is a great distortion of the
legitimate desire and pride to be unique, which is who we are. “We are
divine, and we must live not by the survival of the fittest, but in a
way that supports everyone and everything on this planet” (Bruce H.
Lipton, The Biology of Beliefs).</p>
<p>The hard competitive mindset is the ever-present threat that prevents
us from being spontaneous, creative, and at ease with ourselves, with
others, and with the world. While competition divides, cooperation
unites. By cooperation I do not mean “doing good” to feel better than
those we help, but the “virtue” that recognizes the value of committing
to being an active part of society that cares and intelligently provides
for those who cannot keep up, especially by teaching and by example.
Competition is the natural progeny of superiority. It is also what
hinders the movement towards union, which alone can bring integration to
our physical, emotional, and mental health.</p>
<p>The time has come to use our powerful technologies for the good of
all, rather than for the delusional good of the self-proclaimed fittest.
The idea of separation, which finds its expression in the reductionism
of classical physics, must be replaced by the experience of union and
inclusion already evident in the holism of life. “There is not a single
isolated fragment in all of nature, each fragment is part of a
harmonious and complete unity” (John Muir). Only by recognizing this
crucial interdependence can humanity go beyond the repetition of the
same dysfunctional patterns that have caused so much unnecessary
suffering to our species and to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many sages throughout history have suggested that we are beings of
light that will not die with the death of the body, because we are here
to learn and grow. I think we are here to learn to collectively create
new worlds in which to operate at a much higher level of cooperation,
creativity, and fulfillment than we now can at this early stage of our
spiritual evolution. The possibility of experiencing our true nature is
already supported by the enlightened personal experiences of millions of
people around the globe, and by countless “anecdotal” facts and events
that science hesitates to investigate. If we open ourselves to this
potential that is dormant in us and ask our greater self to show the
way, we may soon be able to experience an unsuspected unity in our
lives, the early signs of humanity’s awakening to its true power and
purpose.</p>
<h1 id="union-is-in-the-heart">Union Is in the Heart</h1>
<p>Follow the advice of your heart, because no one will be more faithful
to you than him.</p>
<p>—Book of Sirach, 37.13</p>
<p>I think that the positive forces that will create our future will not
be the forces and the laws of matter, but those of conscious
cooperation, comprehension, and love for others that all beings in
existence must sooner or later manifest because these values are the
essence of our deepest nature.</p>
<p>I also think that the most effective way to achieve union is through
a process of collective and cooperative creation of a just, empathic,
and loving society through right and courageous actions informed by the
heart and by the intuitive and rational mind. Then our experience and
knowing will grow in our hearts and they will guide our individual
actions through an ever-higher level of consciousness. Unfortunately,
today there is the real danger of letting ourselves be seduced by the
spreading culture of digital ontology and digital consumerism that
replaces true and profound relationships with virtual and superficial
ones, thus halting, if not reversing, our spiritual development.</p>
<p>Social networks designed to bombard people with suggestive messages,
often personalized to reinforce personal biases or based on false
information or on presumed conspiratorial theories, generate groups that
can become alienated from reality in self-isolating worlds. Nikola Tesla
said that “progress must serve to improve the human race; if not, it is
only a perversion.”</p>
<p>Technology must be used to help us discover our true nature, not to
further imprison us in meaningless virtual worlds designed to enrich the
richest. We have come to the point where we can truly unite as humans no
matter where we were born, or stay divided in warring factions with
everincreasing destructive technology on our side.</p>
<p>Only when we truly comprehend that we are responsible for our
experiences and that the choice is ours alone, can we begin to truly
know ourselves and the world.</p>
<p>To know ourselves more and more, we need a new empathic science that
can convert scientific knowledge into deep lived knowing and from it
generate new scientific knowledge. Similarly, we need a new rational
spirituality that can convert lived knowing into new scientific
knowledge and from it generate new lived knowing. These two disciplines
can then intertwine in endless and mutual crescendo.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the Creative Principle of One. Within this
vision, empathic science and rational spirituality, integrating and
interweaving, will evermore increase our loving, joyful, and fulfilling
union with the Whole.</p>
<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>Agentivity. The capacity of each seity to interact with other
entities with free will, for the purpose of deepening her own
self-knowing and the knowing of each other as herself.</p>
<p>Axioms vs. dogmas. In mathematics, axioms are self-evident statements
presumed to be true. In physics and science, axioms are typically
derived from observations and experiments. Axioms must be falsifiable at
least through their experimental predictions. Religious, political, or
philosophical dogmas are indemonstrable beliefs that are accepted on
faith without being questioned. Dogmas are rarely falsifiable, and thus
create a belief system that imprisons the healthy evolution of
selfknowing and comprehension.</p>
<p>Bit. The bit is an abstract mathematical entity that can be used to
represent a binary variable, i.e., a variable that can only have two
states, “1” or “0,” “true” or “false,” “up” or “down,” etc. The meaning
of the two states is not inherent in the bit, but is convened and may
depend on the context in which the bit is found. For example, a bit may
represent the state of truth of a hypothesis (true or false); the
simplest possible distinction, such as right or left, exists or doesn’t
exist; the digit 0 or 1 of the binary number system; and so on. (See
also Chapter 4, What Is a Bit?)</p>
<p>The information processed by computers generally consists of a
sequence or string of bits the length of which typically consists of
multiples of four bits (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 64). A 4-bit string is
called a nibble and can discriminate 16

<p>The bit can be represented by a physical device that has two stable
states, for example an electronic flip-flop, or two bands of electrical
voltages at the input or output of an electronic circuit, as explained
in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>CIP framework. The acronym CIP is formed by the initials of the words
Consciousness, Information, and Physical to specify a framework in which
C-space is the space of conscious experiences, I-space is the space of
live information, and P-space stands for the physical space perceived by
an embodied seity. The CIP framework [13] postulates that the
fundamental nature of reality is constituted by a field that has an
irreducible semantic and symbolic aspect called C-space and I-space
respectively. In this conceptual framework:</p>
<p>1. C-space is the subjective and private semantic space of
consciousness. It is an extra-physical experiential space and time— not
the spacetime of physics—made by the qualia experiences of all conscious
entities. C-space is inseparable from the symbolic space of live
information (I-space). Together they form the ontology of One. Every
entity that emerges from One possesses both aspects. Within
D’Ariano-Faggin QIP theory, a quantum system in a pure state is a
conscious entity experiencing its own state within C-space.</p>
<p>2. I-space is the objective and public symbolic space that contains
the live information in which the seities have translated a portion of
their meaning to be symbolically communicated to other seities. Ispace
contains both uncorrelated and correlated live symbols. The uncorrelated
constitute the classical symbols that behave deterministically, whereas
the correlated form the atoms, molecules, and macromolecules that
hierarchically combined quantum particles and interact in accordance
with the laws of quantum physics. In Ispace there are also very complex
symbols, both live and classical, which can process live and classical
symbols to create other symbols. Two examples of complex symbols are:
the electronic brain of a self-driving car, and a living organism that
creates within itself a symbolic representation of the outer world.</p>
<p>3. P-space is the physical world experienced by the ego, i.e., by the
portion of the seity’s consciousness that believes himself to be the
body in which he is “incarnated.” The nature of P-space depends
crucially on the type of information processing performed by the
species, and on the specific qualia of each ego. The organism controlled
by the ego selects a portion of the I-space information to be perceived.
This information is sensed and processed by the body and transformed
into live information, which the ego perceives and “colors” with his
distinctive qualia, experiences, and comprehensions. In turn, the ego
transforms a portion of his meaning into live information within the
cells of the body to produce the intended actions (symbols) in the
physical world. The ego therefore controls a body (an I-space symbolic
structure) that acts as an intermediary between the C-space of
experience and the I-space of other live symbols. The space of classical
symbols is a subset of Ispace whose symbols are uncorrelated mixtures of
live symbols that behave deterministically, like a computer system for
example.</p>
<p>Classical information. Information is an abstract concept that refers
to the capacity of a physical event to inform a conscious observer. This
concept connects the world of shareable physical events to the
subjective meaning that the same event carries for each observer, since
we know that the same event informs various observers differently. Only
by assuming that all observers are identical, and that they do not
disturb what is observed, can information be quantified in the form
of</p>
<p>Shannon’s information. This kind of information can only describe the
deterministic world of classical physics exemplified by digital
computers. Conscious observers and free will cannot exist in such a
reality.</p>
<p>Classical physics vs. quantum physics. According to the OPT theory
(Operational Probabilistic Theory) developed by Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano
and his collaborators, quantum physics and classical physics can be
derived from six postulates that are entirely informational. Five of
these postulates are in common. The sixth postulate prescribes
entanglement for quantum physics and its absence for classical
physics.</p>
<p>Collapse of the wave function. In quantum physics, the evolution of
the state of an isolated system is represented by the evolution of a
unit vector in a complex N-dimensional Hilbert space whose direction
changes over time. When a quantum system interacts with a measurement
system, it produces a classical observable in spacetime; for example, it
activates a sensor designed to detect a specific particle or atom at a
certain time and place. The mathematical theory of quantum physics only
predicts the probability of the possible states that will be measured,
but it does not predict the state that will manifest. The lack of a
theory that specifies the actual state that will manifest when the
“collapse of the state vector (or wave function)” occurs constitutes the
so-called measurement problem that has never been satisfactorily
solved.</p>
<p>Conscious entity. This refers to any “system” or entity that has an
inner experience made of qualia. In the text, the terms thoughtform,
consciousness unit
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>C</mi><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(C U)</annotation></semantics></math>
, and seity are used to indicate specific types of conscious
entities.</p>
<p>Consciousness unit. According to the CIP framework, each new
selfknowing of One creates a consciousness unit (CU). Similar to
Leibniz’s monads, CUs are elementary seities that represent the unique
point of view, or perspective, with which One has known Itself and
continues to deepen its own self-knowing. CUs can know themselves and
other seities, can create other CUs like themselves, and can combine
with other CUs to create a hierarchy of seities. Each seity, elementary
or combined, is a part-whole of One possessing all the fundamental
properties of One.</p>
<p>Dualism. Term that refers to the Cartesian mind-matter dualism in
which everything that exists is considered to be composed of two
different “substances”: mind and matter. Philosophical dualism is in
opposition to monism, which asserts that everything comes from a single
“substance,” for example matter (materialism) or mind (idealism).</p>
<p>Entropy. The concept of entropy refers to a measurable property of a
physical system that is associated with a state of disorder, randomness,
or uncertainty. The term “entropy” was first used in classical
thermodynamics. The concept was then extended to statistical physics and
information theory. A closed system out of thermal equilibrium naturally
and irreversibly evolves toward thermal equilibrium, i.e., toward a
stable state of maximum entropy, or maximum disorder, in which the
transformations are reversible. Any closed physical system that has not
reached thermal equilibrium is in a state in which entropy is less than
the maximum possible and will spontaneously and naturally evolve until
it reaches its maximum value (maximum disorder).</p>
<p>Epistemic. Refers to what can be known about reality. In the context
of the QIP theory, a quantum system that is in a pure state is in an
“ontic state,” i.e., is in a well-defined state, only knowable as a
conscious experience (qualia) by the system that is in that state. On
the other hand, an outer observer of such a system is in an “epistemic
state.” In this state, the observers can only know the probabilities of
manifestation of all the possible observables of that system. The actual
state that will manifest is generally not knowable and the ontic state
is strictly private.</p>
<p>Fluctuations of the quantum vacuum. Random variations of the state of
the quantum vacuum which can occur at any point in space. These
fluctuations are a consequence of the uncertainty principle but are not
directly observable, although their collective presence is the cause of
many observable phenomena. They always appear as virtual particles,
created spontaneously as particle-antiparticle pairs that are
annihilated within a time shorter than that established by Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>Free will. The ability of a seity (quantum system) to decide which
state to manifest next. A classical system is deterministic, and
therefore cannot have free will. The indeterminism of quantum physics
makes the existence of free will possible, although most current
interpretations of quantum physics do not allow it. Quantum entanglement
is incompatible with the notion that the state that will manifest exists
prior to the measurement. As proposed in the QIP theory, it is possible
for a quantum system to decide which state to manifest. In this case,
the future state is only known by the system immediately after its
decision but prior to the manifestation. For the external observer the
future state is only a probability until it manifests. Free will
requires that the state that will manifest cannot be algorithmically
derived; it is a creative state.</p>
<p>General relativity

. The geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in
1915. This theory generalizes special relativity and replaces with a
local theory Newton’s universal law of gravitation, which requires
action at a distance. It is a mathematical theory that links spacetime
in four dimensions with the distribution and flow of mass, energy, and
momentum using a system of partial differential equations. Within GR the
gravitational force becomes an apparent force observed in non-inertial
reference frames. General relativity is the basis of all contemporary
macroscopic cosmological models, and predicts the generation and
propagation of gravitational waves that have recently been
experimentally detected.</p>
<p>Hilbert space. A vector space that generalizes the notion of
Euclidean space to N-dimensions, either real or complex. A complex
number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number

. Introduced by the famous mathematician David Hilbert at the beginning
of the twentieth century, this space has provided an enormous
contribution to the development of functional and harmonic analysis.
Thanks to the definition of complex Hilbert space, it was possible to
formalize the theory of Fourier series and generalize it using arbitrary
bases. The properties of Hilbert spaces are often counterintuitive and
extraordinary. They allow us to describe all salient properties of
quantum fields and their interactions.</p>
<p>Identity. The property of a CU or seity who knows that the experience
she is having is hers and hers alone. It is a form of “double
reflection,” or self-consciousness, in the sense that the entity, by
knowing she is experiencing her own state, can direct her own experience
“from within.” Having identity is a necessary condition for having free
will and true autonomy, i.e., the capacity for self-determination.</p>
<p>Knowing vs. knowledge. In this book there is a crucial distinction
between conscious and unconscious knowledge that is generally neglected
in the scientific literature. I have pointed this out in the Preface of
the book, and I concisely repeat the explanation here for convenience.
The confusion is facilitated by the lack of appropriate words in the
English language to discriminate the two kinds of knowing. In the
Italian language there are two verbs, conoscere and sapere, instead of
only “to know,” that allow us to distinguish the two types of knowledge,
even though in common usage the two verbs are not always used
consistently. In my English translation I have consistently used
“knowing” to translate conoscere, with the meaning “conscious
knowledge,” and “knowledge” to translate sapere, to mean “unconscious
knowledge.” This distinction is essential to discriminate between the
symbolic-only knowledge of computers or brains and the semantic knowing
of a conscious entity.</p>
<p>Knowing. This refers to conscious knowledge (comprehension) and
conscious knowing (meaning), of which there are three types:</p>
<p>1. Conventional knowing. The conscious knowledge that has been
implicitly or explicitly convened among human beings. For example, the
meaning of words and other symbols that require comprehension. This also
refers to being conscious of the mechanical knowledge obtained through
the automatic learning processes of the brain. It is important to
realize that what we often call meaning is another symbol used to
“explain” the meaning of a word we do not understand. This can only work
to the extent that the actual meaning of the other symbol is already
known. If the basic concept or experience is not yet comprehended, words
alone will be powerless to explain it.</p>
<p>Note that the meaning of scientific terms is a fully operational
“relational knowledge,” which does not explain the true meaning of the
terms per se and produces circularity. For example, energy is what
produces motion, and motion is what is produced by energy, but no one
can explain what energy or motion really are. Furthermore, most of our
reasoning and thinking involves the manipulation of symbols and not of
meanings. This process produces mechanical understanding instead of deep
comprehension, exemplified by a statement like, “It is so because the
math says so.” In other words, we too often behave like machines.</p>
<p>2. Indirect knowing. The type of knowing obtained by a conscious
entity based on the observation of the live symbols created by another
entity to express her own knowing. The comprehension of these symbols is
related to the meaning already existing in the receiving seity, since
the meaning comes before the symbol used to represent it.</p>
<p>3. Direct knowing. Refers to a seity’s endogenous comprehension of
the meaning that spontaneously emerges out of her own qualia experience.
The seity may later generate a live symbol to communicate a portion of
that new meaning. This type of knowing is an entirely quantum phenomenon
that does not exist in a classical system such as a computer. It is
possible only through a lived experience, which allows the seity to
“become” what she knows. Chapters 12 and 13 discuss this crucial
subject.</p>
<p>Knowledge. Refers to the unconscious knowledge possessed by computers
or living organisms in the form of data loaded into their memory,
acquired/learned patterns, and action-reaction patterns created by
artificial or biological neural networks, or by inference engines. This
is also the type of knowledge of a human brain when it operates
mechanically without the free will and comprehension that can only come
from self-consciousness. This knowledge is mechanical knowledge or
symbolic-only knowledge in which conscious meaning is irrelevant. Human
beings or animals may be conscious of their mechanical knowledge.
However, unless their conscious free will changes the behavior informed
by their mechanical knowledge, they behave no differently than
unconscious robots.</p>
<p>Live information. The type of information used by seities to
communicate with living organisms. It consists of elementary particles,
atoms, and molecules that interact quantumly and self-organize based on
quantum rather than classical laws of physics. Live information makes no
sharp distinction between energy, matter, and information. Systems made
of live information are correlated organizations of live symbols such as
atoms, molecules, and biomolecules interacting individually inside
living cells. These types of interactions are for the moment poorly
understood since living organisms have been studied as if they were
classical biochemical systems rather than quantum-classical
information-processing systems.</p>
<p>Locality. Refers to systems that obey the locality principle, which
states that an object can only be influenced by its immediate
surrounding environment. This principle requires that any action at a
distance be mediated by waves or particles, the maximum speed of which
is the speed of light. The principle of locality, when applied to
objects that behave probabilistically, leads to statistical limits
established by Bell’s theorem. Nonlocality implies the existence of
correlations that violate Bell’s theorem. This happens routinely with
quantum systems because, when they interact, they become entangled.
Entanglement is a nonlocal property that does not exist in classical
systems (see the Quantum entanglement entry in this glossary).</p>
<p>Materialism. A philosophical concept stating that matter is the
substance of which everything is made, including mental states.
According to materialism, consciousness is an epiphenomenon of matter.
Materialism is now more often called physicalism to indicate that
everything that exists is physical, in recognition that in quantum
physics matter has become increasingly abstract, and ontology has
shifted from elementary particles to the quantum fields of which
particles are states rather than separate objects. Materialism or
physicalism is a monism in opposition to idealism. Idealism is also a
monism because it affirms that physical reality is a mental
construction, i.e., matter is a phenomenon produced by the mind.</p>
<p>Meaning. The essence of the knowing that is carried by qualia within
a conscious experience. Meaning can also be carried by classical symbols
in conventional knowing, as explained under Knowing in this glossary.
Meaning is what symbolic information is supposed to convey. The
information handled by computers has no meaning to them, though it has
meaning for their creators. Machines are indeed proxies of their
creators. The fact that we attribute meaning or intention to a robot is
a grave human misunderstanding that must be rectified.</p>
<p>Much of the meaning of the objects that surround us was intuitively
learned as children and then refined through education and experience,
both at home and at school. For example, a stone may represent itself,
or it may have an implicit meaning linked to its usefulness (a defensive
weapon, or building material), or derive from an explicit agreement, for
example, “If you see a stone in front of my front door, it means that
I’m in my office.” The meaning of physical objects is very different
from the endogenous meaning of thoughts and feelings. For example, the
meaning of a new idea or the meaning of the love I feel for my child
come entirely “from within”; they are not agreements, implicit or
explicit.</p>
<p>Monism. A philosophical concept claiming that at the foundation of
reality there is a single fundamental principle or “substance.” Monism
is opposed to dualism or pluralism.</p>
<p>Morphism. Indicates the existence of a map between one structure and
another of the same or of a different type. For example, in set theory,
functions are morphisms. In category theory, objects don’t necessarily
have to be sets and their relationships don’t have to be just maps. In
mathematics there are various forms of morphism with different
properties, for example homomorphism, isomorphism, automorphism,
epimorphism, etc.</p>
<p>Observable. In physics, an observable is a quantity that can be
measured. If the system is governed by classical physics, the state of
the system can be known directly because it is described by a
real-valued function. If the system is quantum, however, the state of
the system is not directly knowable (no-cloning theorem). What is
observable can be obtained by transforming the quantum state of the
system with a mathematical operator associated with the observable.
However, this transformation produces a probability distribution of
measuring each of the possible values of the observable, not the state
that will be observed.</p>
<p>One. The totality of what exists, both in potentiality and in
actuality. One is irreducibly holistic, dynamic, and creative. One is
the interiority that connects all Its creations “from within.” One wants
to know Itself and self-actualize. Consciousness units (CUs) emerge from
One each time One knows Itself with a new perspective about Itself. CUs
communicate with each other and combine, thus creating all realities,
both inner and outer. What we call matter is the outer aspect of reality
made up of the symbolic forms created by CUs and seities to represent
the meaning they exchange with each other to know themselves ever
more.</p>
<p>Ontic. Refers to what is real, what really exists. In the context of
QIP theory, a quantum system that is in a pure state is in an “ontic
state,” i.e., in a well-defined state that can be known as a conscious
experience (qualia) by the system that is in that state. The
impossibility of cloning (copying, reproducing) a quantum state ensures
that this state is private, only knowable “from within” by its owner.
Note that the ontology is in the private experience, not in the
representation of the experience that is what we call a pure quantum
state. A seity is represented by a quantum system that is in an ontic
state that evolves by maintaining the purity of its state. A seity can
transform live information (shareable symbols) into quantum information
(experience, meaning), and vice versa, with free will.</p>
<p>OPT (Operational Probabilistic Theory). This is a theory of theories
based on information, considered to be the ultimate abstract entity out
of which physical theories emerge. It is due to G.M. D’Ariano and his
collaborators [7]. OPT derives all the fundamental equations of
classical and quantum physics, from Maxwell’s to Dirac’s, based on six
purely informational postulates. Within OPT, quantum physics supervenes
on quantum information, and classical physics supervenes on quantum
physics.</p>
<p>Panpsychism. The idea that the mind or some other mental aspect—
consciousness, for example—has always been an integral part of reality.
Panpsychism is one of the most ancient philosophical theories, already
proposed by the Vedas, by Thales, Plato, Plotinus, Spinoza, Leibniz,
Russell, and many others. The QIP theory claims that a quantum system in
a pure state consciously experiences its state. With QIP, panpsychism
becomes for the first time a falsifiable physical theory. According to
QIP, consciousness and free will cannot exist in any classical system
because they cannot derive from any deterministic system, no matter how
complex those systems are.</p>
<p>Part-whole. A part that also contains the essence of the whole. Two
examples are (1) a seity that contains the essence of One, and (2) each
cell of a multicellular organism that contains the genome of the
fertilized egg that created the entire organism.</p>
<p>QIP (Quantum Information-based Panpsychism) theory. A quantum
panpsychist theory developed by G.M. D’Ariano and F. Faggin [10],
defining consciousness, for the first time, as the ability of a quantum
system that is in a pure quantum state to experience its own state in
the form of qualia. The theory also establishes that a conscious system
can transform quantum information into live information, and vice versa,
using free will, thus allowing communication with the classical world to
be mediated by living organisms that translate live information into
classical information, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Within QIP theory, the phenomenology of a conscious experience is
highly similar to the phenomenology of quantum information since an
experience is definite, private, and cannot be reproduced, just like a
pure quantum state. Therefore, quantum information can properly
represent a private state only known by the system that is in that state
(ontic state). The state of knowledge of an external observer of a
system in an ontic state is called an epistemic state because the
observer can only know the probabilities of manifestation of the
observables.</p>
<p>Qualia. This term refers to the sensations and feelings that emerge
in the consciousness of an entity following the perception of
information. The first theory that specifically identifies a plausible
physical correlate to qualia is the QIP theory. According to QIP, qualia
can only originate in a quantum system that is in a pure quantum state
that evolves by maintaining the purity of its state. Special quantum
systems called seities can also direct the evolution of their pure state
using free will, and communicate with other seities using live
information. This involves free-will transformations from quantum to
live information, and vice versa, performed by the seities without the
need to have a physical body. Within QIP, the long-term memory of a
conscious experience requires live or classical information [10].</p>
<p>Quantum computer. A physical system that exploits quantum
entanglement as a computational resource. This allows operations to be
performed exponentially faster than what is possible with a classic
computer, at least for some algorithms.</p>
<p>Quantum entanglement. A phenomenon that creates nonlocal correlations
between the states of the fields that have interacted. This phenomenon
does not exist in classical physics. When two quantum systems interact,
they become entangled by creating a new system whose state is “more”
than the sum of the states of the parts. This means that the interacting
systems are no longer independent from each other even after they have
separated. Therefore, the measurement of the observable of one of the
systems simultaneously determines the value of the entangled observable
of the other system, regardless of their physical distance. The
correlations of entangled quantum systems may exceed the socalled Bell
bound, which the correlations of classical systems never violate. The
Bell theorem establishes the maximum percentage of correlations (the
Bell bound) that are possible in a classical probabilistic system when
we repeat the same measurement process on many systems prepared the same
way. Entangled quantum systems may inexplicably exceed such a bound.</p>
<p>The only way to explain this phenomenon is that the state that will
be measured cannot exist prior to the measurement, but must be created
simultaneously for both systems during the measurement process. How
these nonlocal correlations can happen is still a mystery, because they
would require superluminal communication between the two distant
systems, thus violating the locality principle upon which special
relativity is based.</p>
<p>In spite of the presence of instantaneous correlations, the
probabilistic nature of the measurement outcomes does not allow
superluminal communication because whoever communicates must know the
state he needs to encode his message before the measurement, but that is
impossible.</p>
<p>Quantum information. The amount of information contained in the
quantum state of a quantum system. Quantum information can be
manipulated in quantum computers using special techniques that make the
state of a quantum system evolve deterministically. Note that there is a
fundamental difference between quantum and classical states: the former
are private, i.e., non-reproducible, while the latter are public, i.e.,
shareable.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics. By quantum mechanics we mean the physics of
systems described by the Schrödinger equation or by Heisenberg’s matrix
mechanics; two formalisms that turned out to be equivalent. Quantum
mechanics is non-relativistic and has been superseded by quantum physics
represented by Dirac’s relativistic equation, which is the foundation of
quantum field theory. In G.M. D’Ariano’s OPT theory [7], quantum physics
supervenes on quantum information and classical physics supervenes on
quantum physics.</p>
<p>Quantum nonlocality. Refers to the violation of the locality
principle in quantum physics. This phenomenon is entirely due to quantum
entanglement (see Quantum entanglement).</p>
<p>Quantum vacuum. The state of lowest energy of empty space (vacuum).
However, this energy cannot be zero due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. This causes fluctuations in the vacuum energy with measurable
collective consequences, even though the individual fluctuations are not
measurable. For instance, the Casimir effect is an attractive force
between two plates very close to each other due to such
fluctuations.</p>
<p>Qubit. The qubit or quantum bit is the elementary unit of quantum
information, i.e., it is the quantum version of the classical bit. While
a classical bit only represents two possible states, the qubit
represents the quantum superposition of two complementary state vectors
in a twodimensional Hilbert space, conventionally represented as
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">|</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|1\rangle</annotation></semantics></math>
and

, |up and |down , or |right and |left . This superposition creates an
infinity of possible states that can be imagined as all the points on
the surface of a sphere of radius 1 (called the Bloch sphere). Examples
of qubits are the spin of an electron, whose two states are |up and
|down , and the polarization of a photon, whose two states are vertical
and horizontal polarization,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">|</mo><mo>↑</mo><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left|\uparrow\right\rangle</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">|</mo><mo>&gt;</mo><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left|&gt;\right&gt;</annotation></semantics></math>
. Qubits can be entangled—a property not found in classical
systems—allowing certain computations to be made much faster than is
possible with classical computers. Over the past decade, the
international race to develop a viable quantum computer has dramatically
accelerated.</p>
<p>Randomness. Refers to a total lack of predictability of an event. A
sequence of events that is not predictable by any algorithm is called
random. The collapse of the wave function is a random event. When the
same quantum experiment is repeated, even though each individual event
is random, the frequency of certain patterns can be predictable. For
example, when two “quantum dice” are thrown simultaneously, the
probability of getting 7 as the sum of the two outcomes is three times
that of getting 2. In this sense, randomness does not imply complete
lack of any pattern. This is particularly relevant in quantum physics
since individual events are random, but the repetition of random events
may create highly reproducible patterns. In fact, the deterministic
classical physics of macroscopic objects—which are made of huge numbers
of quantum events—emerges from the randomness of quantum physics.</p>
<p>Seity. Seity is a quantum entity with three irreducible and
indivisible fundamental properties: consciousness, agency, and identity.
The elementary seities, which I have called consciousness units (CUs),
emanate directly from One. The combination of communicating CUs, each
with its own consciousness, identity, and free will, gives rise to
hierarchies of seities. By communicating with each other, the seities
create layers of symbolic and semantic organizations that increase their
self-knowing.</p>
<p>Semantics. Deriving from the Greek sema, meaning “sign,” semantics is
that part of linguistics that studies the meaning of individual and
combinations of words (signs).</p>
<p>State of a system. The state of a classical system is formed by the
position and the momentum (velocity multiplied by the mass) of each
classical particle that forms the system. This state requires six
degrees of freedom for each particle and can be precisely known in
principle. The state of system composed by N particles can then be
represented by a vector in a real space of 6N dimensions. By analogy,
the state of a quantum system can be described by a vector in a complex
Mdimensional Hilbert space. The differences between a real and a complex
M-dimensional space are, however, enormous, especially when the
variables are probability amplitudes rather than ontological variables
like actual positions and momenta. A quantum system can be described by
a well-defined state, called a pure state, or by a mixture of states,
called a mixed state.</p>
<p>Symbol. The term “symbol” indicates anything (sign, gesture, object,
animal, person) that can represent a meaning other than that offered by
its immediate sensible aspect. The meaning associated with a symbol can
be either explicitly convened or intuitively understood (implicit
meaning). To communicate, it is essential that the symbols be reliably
recognizable. An object can represent more than one meaning if it can
support two or more states that can be reliably discriminated. For
example, a coin can represent two states (one bit of information), a die
can represent six states (2.59 bits of information), two
indistinguishable dice can represent 21 different states (4.39 bits), a
computer memory of N bits can support
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">N</mi></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{\mathrm{N}}</annotation></semantics></math>
different states.</p>
<p>Thoughtform. Within QIP a thoughtform is a quantum system that exists
in a pure state. Thus, it has a qualia experience for as long as it
exists in a pure state. However, a thoughtform is not aware of being
conscious, i.e., it is not self-conscious and therefore it has neither
free-will agency nor identity. In other words, a thoughtform has no
sense of self (identity), and cannot direct its actions with free will
(agency). A thoughtform is like a cloud that “goes where the wind takes
it,” thickening, dispersing, and combining with other clouds, following
the laws of the clouds without being able to direct its own
behavior.</p>
<p>A quantum computer is an example of a thoughtform, because it
performs a series of deterministic unitary transformations that maintain
the purity of its state during the execution of the program, but has
neither agency (free will) nor self-consciousness (identity). A seity is
a quantum field with identity, agency, and consciousness that can direct
her own experience with free will. Once created, the seity exists and
evolves as a part-whole of One for as long as One exists.</p>
<p>Truth. I think that everything that One knows about Itself defines
truth, since One cannot have internal contradictions. Given the holistic
and dynamic nature of One already reflected in the fundamental nature of
the physical universe we know, truth cannot be made of separable and
static parts. Truth must be composed of parts-whole connected from
within and evolving by ever deepening their own self-knowing without
end. In my opinion this is why the mathematical theories we create to
represent the physical world show unsuspected “connections” between
them.</p>
<p>Unitarity postulate. In the mathematical theory of quantum physics
developed by John von Neumann in the mid-1930s, all state
transformations in a quantum system are assumed to be unitary, i.e.,
they are represented by a unitary operator. Such transformations are
reversible, maintain the purity of the quantum state, and are
deterministic with respect to the probability amplitudes, which are the
state variables in quantum theory. This means that the unitary evolution
of a quantum system occurs entirely within Hilbert space. To produce a
measurable event in spacetime it is necessary to have the “collapse of
the wave function,” a phenomenon that is not predictable by quantum
theory. G.M. D’Ariano has recently proven that the unitarity postulate
cannot be falsified, therefore it should be discarded, for it
unnecessarily limits the types of quantum transformations possible and
creates the “measurement problem” that no one has ever been able to
solve.</p>
<p>Vedas. Religious and philosophical texts that originated in India
more than 3500 years ago. Written in Vedic Sanskrit, they are the basis
of Hinduism. There are four Vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and
Atharvaveda. The word veda means knowing, knowledge, or wisdom.</p>

<p>The Italian version of this book with the title, Irriducibile: La
coscienza, la vita, i computer e la nostra natura, was published by
Mondadori in September 2022. I wrote Part I of that book in English and
Part II in Italian for the reasons explained in the Preface. Following
are the acknowledgments that appeared in the original Italian
version.</p>
<p>I thank my wife Elvia for translating the first English draft of
Irriducibile in Italian, my son Eric, and Andrea Di Blas for reading the
same draft and providing useful comments. Special thanks go to Viviana
and Irene Sardei, my sisters-in-law, who served as editors of the
Italian draft. Their patient work is highly appreciated because it
definitely helped improve the clarity of my thinking and the fluency of
the text. Viviana then contributed most of the rich quotes that show how
my ideas, primarily born from my direct experience rather than from a
comparative study of other people’s thoughts, are also reflected in the
ideas and experiences of many other thinkers and explorers of the inner
world from ancient times to our days. There is no doubt in my mind that
fundamental values unite all of humanity.</p>
<p>I thank Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano, holder of the chair of Theoretical
Physics at the University of Pavia, Italy for the many discussions that
have allowed me to better understand the physics of quantum information
of which he is a world expert. His scientific rigor and the interest in
the study of consciousness that now unites us have allowed me to remain
with my feet on the ground, so to speak, in the exploration of such a
challenging subject.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank Enrica Bortolazzi, my book agent, and Guido Meardi,
CEO of V-Nova, for their appreciated comments. Many thanks go also to
Matteo Stroppa, editor of Mondadori, for his final touch.</p>
<p>I translated the printed version of Irriducibile into English during
the second half of 2022, and I decided to integrate in the main text
most of the material of the Notes that were previously collected at the
end of the book. I also improved the text with further personal
reflections and some of the feedback received from the readers of
Irriducibile. The English version was reviewed by Elvia Faggin, Edward
F. Kelly, Tristan Ze, Andrea Di Blas, Michele Crudele, Franco Ferrant,
and Carollyn Sloan Oglesby who are hereby warmly acknowledged. Many
thanks go to Mollie Barker for her expert final copyediting.</p>
<p>ESSENTIA</p>
<p>Essentia Books, a collaboration between John Hunt Publishing and
Essentia Foundation, publishes rigorous scholarly work relevant to
metaphysical idealism, the notion that reality is essentially mental in
nature. For more information on modern idealism, please visit
www.essentiafoundation.org.</p>
<p>Federico Faggin is one of the greatest luminaries of high<br />
technology alive today. A physicist by education, he is the inventor of
the microprocessor and the Mos silicon gate technology, both of which
underlie the modern world’s entire information technology. With the
knowledge and experience of a lifetime in cutting-edge fields, Federico
now turns his attention to consciousness and the nature of reality,
sharing with us his profound insights on the<br />
classical and quantum worlds, artificial intelligence, life and<br />
the human mind. In this book, he elaborates on an idealist<br />
model of reality, produced after years of careful thought and direct
experience, according to which nature’s most fundamental level is that
of consciousness as a quantum phenomenon, while the classical physical
world consists merely of evocative symbols of a deeper reality.<br />
“Federico Faggin is probably the most well-rounded<br />
idealist alive. He embodies the near-perfect combination<br />
of hard-nosed, scientifically informed thought with direct<br />
introspective insights into the primacy of consciousness.<br />
Irreducible is a true philosophical treasure and,<br />
in some ways, a culmination of Western thought<br />
- an absolute must-read.”<br />

            Quantum   Implications  David Bohm   is   one   of   the foremost scientific thinkers   of   today and one   of   the most distinguished theoretical physicists   of   his generation. His challenge to the conventional understanding   of   quantum theory has led scientists to   reexamine what it   is   they are doing and to question the nature   of   their theories and their scientific methodology.  Quantum Implications   is   a collection   of   original contributions by many   of   the world's leading scholars and   is   dedicated to David Bohm, his work and the issues raised by his ideas.   It   is   a tribute to his creative imagination, his single mindedness, his inspirational guid- ance, and his complete dedication to the further understanding   of   the fundamental issues in physics, philosophy and the general intellectual well-being   of   mankind. The   contributors   span   a   wide   range   of   disciplines   including physics, philosophy, mathematics, psychology, biology   and   art, and all are experts in their own fields. They include some   of   the most distinguished scientists of the day and number three Nobel laureates among them. David Bohm has himself contributed a paper   on   hidden variables and how his ideas relate to the implicate order. There   is   an excellent introduction by the editors, putting Bohm's work in context, explaining   its   more   subtle   points   and   setting   right   some   of the misconceptions that have persisted about the work   of   David Bohm.

            1  General   introduction:   the development   of   David   Bohm's ideas   from   the plasma   to   the impl icate order  B.   J.   Hiley   and   F. David Peat  David Bohm was   born   in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1917. His father   ran   a successful furniture business, making his way to the USA from what was then Austria-Hungary. There appears   to   be   no   physics whatsoever in the family background. Bohm, himself, became inter- ested in science   at   an   early age, being urged   on   by a fascination   of finding   out   how things worked.   By   the age of eight he   had   already been introduced to science fiction. This fired his imagination   and   gen- erated in him a deep interest in real science. But it was the nature of the real world   that   fascinated him most. He recalls the profound effect that   a   book   on   astronomy   had   on   him in those formative years. He was struck   by the   vast   order   and   regularity   of the   universe.   This impressed him so much   that   he began to devote a great deal of time to science. Needless to say, his father became somewhat concerned   about   the boy's future.   Being a successful businessman, he could   not   imagine how anyone could make a living   out   of 'scientism' as he insisted   on calling it. Young David   took   this as a challenge   and   using his earlier interest in redesigning mechanical devices he decided to try to make money   out   of inventing.   He   was   rather   proud   of one invention in par- ticular: namely, a 'dropless pitcher'. (This ingenious item   had   nothing at   all to   do   with   that   great American sporting pastime, baseball. It was a   jug   or   teapot   that   did   not   drip!) His principal concern now became how to make this design pay. After almost giving up in de- spair, he came across   an   advertisement in a   popular   science magazine offering, for the sum of   $5,   advice   on   how to exploit financially a good invention. Off went the   $5   and   back came some advice   on   how to obtain a patent. But that, of course, would cost a   few   hundred dollars! Would it be worth it? The answer (apparently, included in the $5!) was to   do   a   door-to-door   survey to test market demand! It was   at

            2   B.   J.   Hiley   and   F.   David   Peat  this   point in   his   life   that   he determined   that   he   would   become a theoretical physicist. As   he began to study physics seriously, he was repeatedly struck by the interconnectedness   of   what,   at   a superficial glance, seemed to be totally   unrelated   phenomena.   As   he   delved   deeper   into   the   sub- structure   of   matter   and   its movement, this characteristic of a rich   and highly interconnected substructure became more   and   more apparent. Furthermore, as   Bohm   saw it, these deeper structures seemed to pos- sess properties which did   not   reflect the way physicists were talking about   the behaviour   of   matter.   In   quantum   mechanics, for example, it seemed   that   this   interconnectedness   was   vital,   yet   the   usual   pre- sentation of the subject seemed to minimise this aspect   of   the phenom- ena. In   Bohm's original perception., this   notion   of   interconnectedness was rather   vague   and   ill-defined   but   with its continual reappearance in different forms, the   notion   slowly   took   shape, ultimately leading to a very radical   and   novel way of looking   at   reality. This view eventually crystallised into what he now terms the implicate order. But much was to   happen   before   that   idea eventually became clear. The   first formal indication   of   Bohm's   departure   from   orthodoxy can   be traced   to   his reformulation   of   quantum   mechanics published in   Physical   RevieM-'   in 1952.   1   But the ideas   that   lay behind   that   for- mulation seem to   many   to be totally against the spirit of his later work   on   the implicate order, so much so   that   they find it   hard   to   see any connection   at   all.   It   is   true   that   those papers were more intent   on demonstrating   that   there was   another   logically coherent interpretation of   the   quantum   mechanical formalism,   other   than   the usual one. But it   is   the ideas implicit in this reformulation   that   have connections with the   notion   of   the implicate order. Since there has been some interest in this connection,   we   have asked   David   to write a   short   article outlining what he sees as the essential relationship between the two.   2 We would like here to present   an   overall sketch   of   the relevant background   in which Bohm's ideas   took   shape so   that   the reader can appreciate the significance   of   the various developments in a   broader context. This will also enable us to relate the various contributions to this   book   to the same   background   and   so see where they   fit   in.   By doing this   we   hope the   book   will become more   than   a collection of isolated contributions. Bohm's interest in the fundamental questions   of   physics start.ed   at high school. Even   at   that   early stage he was beginning to ask how the theories   of   physics enable one to build   up   an   understanding   of   reality. At college he   soon   quickly became fascinated with   quantum   mechanics and   relativity as he began to study these subjects in   depth   for the first time. After   graduating   he began his research project under the supervision of   Robert Oppenheimer. His dissertation topic involved a theoretical

            General introduction   3  study of   neutron-proton   scattering. Yet even while working   on   this technical problem, he kept   up   his interests in fundamentals, always probing deeper into   quantum   theory   and   relativity. He remembers his long discussions with Joseph Weinberg, who had made a study of Bohr's point of view. During that period he admits to becoming a supporter of Bohr's position. Before receiving his doctorate in 1943 from Berkeley, he moved to the Radiation Laboratory where he worked   on   problems connected with the later phases of the   Manhattan   Project. He was involved in a theoretical study of the ionisation   of   uranium fluoride in   an   electric arc which formed   part   of   the broader study of the problems involved in   the   separation   of   235U   from   238U.   Thus   began   his   interest   in plasma physics, to which he made some outstanding contributions. Although much of this work   was basically involved in technical problems, Bohm could   not   help noticing the philosophical implications. The individual   particles in the   plasma were highly correlated   and behaved like   an   organic whole rather   than   a mechanistic system. The plasma constantly   regenerated   itself   and   surrounded   all   impurities with a sheath so as to isolate them completely.   To   understand in more detail how the plasma functioned, it was necessary to study the re- lation between the individual   and   the collective modes of behaviour. It was here   that   he introduced the idea of collective co-ordinates   and developed a general way of handling plasmas. When he took up the post   of   assistant professor   at   Princeton Univer- sity he extended his earlier ideas to study the behaviour of electrons in metals, where   quantum   mechanics played   an   essential role. It was his innovative work in this area   that   established David Bohm's repu- tation as a theoretical physicist. Neither   of   the editors knew Bohm in those days,   but   fortunately Eugene Gross, who was one of Bohm's first graduate students, has given a personal sketch of Bohm's thinking in the period he spent at Princeton.   This   is   presented   in   the   introduction   to   his   article   on 'Collective variables in elementary   quantum   mechanics' which appears in this volume.   3   We are particularly grateful for his contribution   and find that the final   paragraph   to his introduction captures the feeling that   many of us, students   and   colleagues, felt towards David Bohm: a totally unselfish   man   who shares his latest thoughts   on   many topics with his colleagues   and   students alike. This enthusiasm for the search for order in nature continues unabated today. The main   part   of Gross's contribution   is   an   illustration   of   how collective co-ordinates can provide a useful way   of   understanding the behaviour   of different   systems.   He   takes   as   examples   the   atom- molecule transition, the electron interacting with two lattice oscillators and   ends with some remarks concerning the polaron problem. The following article   is   by   another   of Bohm's graduate students, David Pines.   4   It   is   a masterful review   of   some of the basic ideas involved in

            4   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  the development   of   plasma physics. He also outlines the role played by Bohm in developing the concepts needed to deal with the problems, and   touches   on   the application   of   the   random   phase approximation and   its use in liquid helium (4He). While still   at   Princeton, Bohm was asked to give a course of lectures on   quantum   mechanics to undergraduates   and   was faced with the task of   presenting a clear account   of   the subject that had fascinated him for some time. Here was a theory   that   had emerged after a long struggle by many physicists to account correctly for a wide range   of   experi- mental results, which the classical theory could not even begin to explain. But the conceptual structure   of   this theory was very different from   that   of   the classical theory. It implied a radical change in   our outlook   on   reality. But precisely what were the nature of these changes did   not   yet seem very clear. The majority view was (and still is) that the precise nature of the conceptual changes are   not   important.   All that was needed was to work with the self-consistent mathematical formalism,   which,   in   some   mysterious   way,   correctly   predicts   the numerical results   of   actual experiments. After lecturing   on   the subject for three years, Bohm thought that this was   not   a satisfactory position   to   adopt   so he decided to try to get   a   better   understanding   of   the   subject   by   writing   a   definitive textbook in which the physical aspects   of   the mathematics would be emphasised.   Part   of   the task would involve clarifying Bohr's inter- pretation of the theory by drawing, to some extent,   on   Bohr's book  Atomic Theory and the Description   of   Nature.   5  It was while writing his book   that   he came into conflict with what eventually became known as McCarthyism. A year   or   so after arriving at   Princeton he was called to appear before the Un-American Activi- ties Committee, a committee   of   the House of Representatives. He was asked to testify against colleagues   and   associates. After taking legal advice he decided to plead the Fifth Amendment. A year   or   so later, while   he   was in the middle   of   his book, his plea was rejected   and   he was   indicted   for   contempt   of   Congress.   While   awaiting   trial,   the Supreme   Court   ruled   that   no one should be forced to testify if the testimony   is   self-incriminating,   provided   no   crime   had   been   com- mitted. Since no crime   had   been committed the indictment against Bohm was dropped. During this period the University advised Bohm to stay away, one of the   few   benefits to emerge from this whole sordid affair. During his enforced isolation he was able to complete the book far sooner than   he had anticipated.   After that, however, with   his contract at Princeton expired, he   was   unable to obtain a   job   in the USA   and   was advised by Oppenheimer to leave the country before the full force of McCarthyism took effect. Fortunately he had some friends in Brazil who were able to offer him a professorship in the University in Sao Paulo. He held this post from   1951   to 1955.

            General introduction   5  The textbook   Quantum Theory   was first published by Prentice-Hall in   1951   and   is still in print today.   It   is generally regarded as one of the best textbooks of its day. Apart from a clear presentation   of   the main physical ideas lying behind the formalism,   the book   has   the additional merit   of   discussing some   of   the more difficult aspects of the theory usually omitted from modern texts.   For   example it contains sections   on   the   approach   to the classical limit, the measurement prob- lem   and   the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen   (EPR)   paradox. The latter was of particular importance since it reformulated the   EPR   example in terms of correlated spin one-half systems. This discussion   not   only clarified the essential issues raised in the debate   but   also led to the suggestion of using positronium decay   and   optical cascades in actual experiments designed specifically to explore the consequences of   EPR situations.   These experiments   have   been   significant   in   moving   the continuing debate from what was generally regarded as a realm of speculative philosophy,   or   even theology, into   hard   physics. All   three   of   the above topics are still the subject of many current research   papers.   Indeed   the contributions   of   Clark, 6   Leggett   7   and Penrose   8   are directly concerned with these topics. Terry Clark reports the experimental progress   that   his   group   at   Sussex University have made in demonstrating   quantum   mechanical behaviour over macro- scopic distances using   SQUIDS.   The aim has been to develop ex- perimental techniques   that   could lead to a better understanding of macroscopic   quantum   mechanics   and   to explore a new   approach   to the measurement problem. Tony Leggett presents   an   excellent review of the measurement prob- lem which he believes to be a 'glaring indication of the inadequacy of quantum   mechanics   as   a   total   world   view'.   He   maps   out   an   ex- ploration of the likely direction in which it   will   break down.   His discussion centres   around   the type of experiments discussed by Clark. By   a vigorous   and   critical   approach   in these directions he hopes to provide a better understanding of how pure states can be converted into mixtures, thus connecting the microworld with   our   familiar classi- cal macroscopic world. Roger Penrose examines a similar question, arguing   that   'an   essentially new   and   non-linear physical   input   to bring about   the collapse'   is   needed   and   that   this input should come from a general-relativistic gravity. He argues   that   the non-local nature of the collapse of the wave function could be connected with the fact   that   in general relativity the energy   cannot   be defined locally. These types of difficulties always tend to leave   an   uneasy feeling that   we   really have   not   got to the   bottom   of   quantum   theory.   As Gell-Mann puts it,   'Quantum   Mechanics,   that   mysterious, confusing discipline which none of us really understands   but   which   we   know how to use.'   9   The problem   is   that   we   do   not   know precisely where the difficulty actually lies.   It   is   quite clear   that   quantum   theory   is   a statistical theory in the sense   that   the description of the individual

            6   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  particle can only be given in terms   of   a probability   of   it being observed at   a certain point in space-time. There   is   no description   of   the indi- vidual process except in terms of its possible observation by some suitable measuring device. There   is   no way to understand what   is happening: there   is   no actual fact. There   is   only a sequence of results of measurements, with no possibility   of   discussing what goes   on   be- tween measurements. This feature has led some physicists to question the existence of micro-realism. Bernard d'Espagnat has given a great deal   of   attention to   this   question   in   his   books   on   the   Conceptual   Foundations   of Quantum   Mechanics   10   and   In   Search   of   Reality.11   In   the   present volume he continues the discussion in a new way   that   involves a detailed comparison   of   Wheeler's point   of   view, which   is   essentially Bohrian,   and   that   of   Bell, who assumes there   is   a micro-reality.12 In classical physics,   of   course, any description in terms of proba- bility can ultimately be understood in terms of ensemble averages over a well-defined individual behaviour. Here the statistical results would have their origins in a collection   of   well-defined individual events. Is there   an   underlying individual behaviour   that   could account for the statistical results   of   quantum   mechanics?   Of   course, the individual behaviour would   not   be classical,   but   something different. The exist- ence of such processes would   not   in any way detract from the present statistical theory which would still be valid   and   very useful in dealing with the more common situation involving many particles, such as for example in electron conduction, etc. However, if   an   underlying process did exist then   an   understanding of this process would lead to a better intuitive understanding   of   the   quantum   phenomena in general. If such a process existed then it would require some set of param- eters to specify it   and   traditionally these parameters have been called 'hidden', presumably because one   is   discussing a new, as yet unknown, process.   All   attempts in   that   direction were brought to a halt as a result   of   a theorem contained in von Neumann's book   The Math- ematical Foundations   of   Quantum   Mechanics.   He   writes, after pre- senting the theorem,   'It   should be noted   that   we   need not go any further into the mechanism of the hidden parameters since   we   know that the established results of   quantum   mechanics can never be re- derived with their help.'   13   Because of the high (and justified) math- ematical reputation   of   von Neumann, this statement, together with the various writings   of   Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, etc., gave rise to the dogma   that   there   is   no alternative. The wave function had now come to be regarded as the most complete description of the state   of   the system, a statement which essentially creates many of the 'problems   of quantum   mechanics'. A year   or   two   after   completing   his   book,   Bohm   produced   an alternative approach to   quantum   mechanics which he published as two papers in the   Physical Review.   They were entitled 'A suggested

            General introduction   7 interpretation   of   the   quantum   theory in terms of "hidden" variables'. 1 The original purpose   of   these two papers was simply to show   that there   is,   in fact,   an   alternative interpretation   of   quantum   mechanics contrary to von   Neumann's   remarks   and   the prevailing view of   that time.   As   Bohm points   out   in his second book,   Causality   and   Chance in   Modern Physics,   this   approach   was never intended to be   an   ultimate definitive statement of what lies behind   quantum   mechanics.   14   Rather it was simply intended to point   out   that   certain assumptions are made in the   usual interpretation which turned   out   to   be   too   restrictive. Indeed this alternative interpretation allows certain things to be done which in the ordinary   approach   are deemed to be impossible.   As   Bell puts it,   'In   1952   I saw the impossible done.'   15   (Some of the features of this   approach   had   already been anticipated by de Broglie   16   in the pilot wave theory   and   by Madelung   17   in his hydrodynamical   ap- proach. However,   both   theories faced serious difficulties with many- body systems.   In   fact   de   Broglie conceded defeat   by   an   objection raised by Pauli   18   and   gave   up   his   approach   until Bohm showed how Pauli's objection could be answered.   1) Unfortunately the physics community did   not   take very kindly to the appearance of this alternative view. Certainly the physicists who had   contributed most to the evolution of the ordinary interpretation felt there was some fundamental flaw in Bohm's argument. Some of the early technical objections raised were quickly answered as they were   based   on   a   misunderstanding   of   how   the   approach   actually worked.   In   fact,   no   sustainable technical objections against the theory have ever been made.   In   its primitive form, the   approach   gives the same   statistical   results   as   the   quantum   theory   and   therefore   ex- periment   cannot   be the arbitrator. Ultimately the objections have their roots in the assumptions one makes   about   the   nature   of reality,   i.e. what constitutes a set   of   reasonable requirements necessary for a physi- cal theory to be .acceptable? Such a question falls outside the normal sphere   of   discourse of the usual physics journals   and   it   is   not   surprising to find   that   nearly all the objections to the theory   appear   in books, conference reports   or Festschrifts of one kind   or   another.   What   we   have found remarkable   is the   emotional   nature   of   the   responses.   For   example,   in   his   book  Physics and Philosophy,   Heisenberg tries to sustain the argument   that it   is   logically impossible to develop   an   alternative point of view   and starts with a   quotation   from Bohr: 'We may hope   that   it will later turn   out   that   sometimes   2   +   2   =   5.'   19   But exactly where the logical contradictions lie   is   never made clear.   Again in the Born-Einstein letters,   Born   writes,   'Pauli   has   come   up   with   an   idea   that   slays Bohm'.20 An examination of Pauli's article   21   in   Louis de Broglie, phJ'- sicien   et   penseur   reveals a criticism   that   can only accuse the alternative approach   of   being 'metaphysical'; a word which nowadays, together with the word 'philosophical',   is   used as a derogatory euphemism to

            8   B.   J.   Hiley   and   F.   David Peat  condemn a theory which doesn't fit into the   common   consensus.   The situation has been summarised very succinctly by Bopp: 'We say   that Bohm's theory   cannot   be refuted, adding, however,   that   we   don't   be- lieve it.'   22 But it   is   not   simply a question   of   belief. Bohm's original intention was to show   that   a consistent alternative does actually exist. This, in itself,   is   important   since it opens the possibility   of   exploring new ideas without being   trapped   into   believing there   is   no   possible alternative. As   someone once aptly remarked,   'I   do   not   know whether   quantum mechanics   is   a beautiful building   or   a prison with very high walls.' With the appearance   of   an   alternative   approach   at   least a ray   of   light has appeared   through   those very high walls! The   emotive terms associated with these arguments led   to   the im- plicit view   that   to   mention the term 'hidden variables' was in some sense to commit a cardinal heresy. Even   today   the term often provokes a sceptical, if   not   irrational   and   antagonistic, response.   Bohm now admits it might have been a mistake to call his theory a 'hidden vari- able theory'. After all, it only uses positions   and   momenta, whereas the real drive for the hidden variable   approach   was to find 'additional' parameters to describe the underlying process. One   can   sympathise with the use   of   the term 'hidden' in the sense that   although a particle   can   have a simultaneous position   and   mo- mentum, we still   cannot   measure them simultaneously.   It   is   in this sense they were called 'hidden'. But perhaps it would be more ap- propriate   to call the wave function   t/J   the 'hidden variable'   23   because, although   both   x   and   p   can   be measured (even   though   not   simul- taneously),   t/J   itself only shows   up   indirectly   through   the   quantum potential, which   is   reflected only in the behaviour   of   the ensemble   of particles.   In   the 1952 work the   quantum   potential plays a crucial role. The essential difference between classical   and   quantum   mechanics   is accounted for by this potential. We will bring these features   out   later. To   answer the more general criticisms   of   his approach, Bohm pres- ented his own ideas in a   broader   context in his   book   Causality and Chance   in   Modern Physics.   14   This   book   showed   that   Bohm was   not only a master in handling the mathematical tools used in physics   but that   he could also think deeply   about   the philosophical   background implicit in the physicist's framework.   The   book   begins by analysing the philosophy   of   mechanism, within which the nineteenth century physics   had   developed.   It   then goes   on   to   discuss the usual interpreta- tion   of   quantum   mechanics within this context   and   to explain, in more general terms, the alternative   approach   that   he outlined in his 1952 papers.   Here   we   already   see   emerging,   for   the   first   time,   his   dis- satisfaction with his 1952 papers.   He   stressed   that   his discontent was not   with the logical consistency   of   the approach.   Rather   he felt   that   it did   not   go far enough   and   thought   that   it was in some way a coarse- grained view   of   something yet deeper underlying   quantum   mechanics.

            General introduction   9  In   his final chapter he raised the possibility   of   a more general con- cept   of   physical laws   that   went beyond mechanism. He suggested the notion   of   the qualitative infinity of nature in which all theories have limitations   on   their domains   of   validity so   that   every theory must be qualified by its context, conditions   and   degrees of approximation to which they are valid.   In   this way scientific research can be freed from irrelevant restrictions which tend to result from the supposition   that   a particular set of general properties, qualities   and   laws must be the correct ones to use in all possible contexts   and   conditions   and   to all degrees of approximation. This was a clear signal   that   David Bohm was   not   going to be tied down by any consensus   that   insisted   that quantum   mechanics was the last word   and   that   all   that   was left was to obey its rules. Again this position was   not   well received in the late 1950s   and   early 1960s. The physics community in general   had   made up its mind   that the earlier achievements of   quantum   electrodynamics, with its suc- cessful treatment of divergences through renormalisation techniques, had   established the paradigm for future work. The central problem thus became one of trying to apply the same method to the weak   and strong interactions in particle physics. Anyone attempting to question the conventional   approach   to   quantum   mechanics was regarded, to put   it mildly, as rather odd. (In actual fact statements made   at   that time were often much stronger!) The prevailing atmosphere therefore was such   that   development of the ideas along the lines   of   the 1952 paper were   not   pursued further. By   that   time Bohm   had   moved from   Brazil via Israel to England, where he held a research fellowship   at   Bristol University from 1957- 61.   There he took   on   a young research student, Yakir Aharonov. To- gether they published a   paper   on   what has become known as the Aharonov-Bohm   (AB) effect.   24   They discovered   that   if one confines a magnetic field in the geometric shadow between the two slits of   an electron interference device,   and   ensures   that   the electrons travel only in a field-free region, then the resulting fringe   pattern   is   shifted, the shift being a function of the flux enclosed in the inaccessible region. Actually the effect   had   been discovered ten years earlier by Ehrenberg and   Siday   25   at   Birkbeck College, where Bohm was to be appointed in   1961   to a chair in theoretical physics. The   Aharonov-Bohm   paper is   cited as the definitive work   on   the subject because   of   its incisiveness. The discussion goes straight to the point   at   issue in a very clear and simple way, a feature   that   has always characterised Bohm's work. The   AB   effect   was   quite   surprising   and   initially   the   work   was received with some suspicion.   As   Weisskopf puts it, 'The first reaction to this work   is   that   it   is   wrong, the second   is   that   it   is   obvious.'   26  Indeed it   is   a direct   result of application of the   standard   rules   of quantum   mechanics. It   is,   in fact, the first example of a gauge theory of the type which today, when generalised, seems to offer the best

In   spite   of   the   fact   that   there   are   at   least four   independent   sets   of experimental techniques verifying the existence   of   the AB effect,   papers still   appear   arguing   that   no   such   effect exists.   The   problem   arises because the vector   potential   plays a   fundamental   role in the calcula- tions, whereas   in   classical physics this   potential   is   regarded   merely as a   mathematical   device.   The   classical   charged   particles   respond   only   to the fields   and   not   to   the potentials. It   is a   great   pity   that   the stigma   of   hidden   variables has stuck with Bohm. We have often been greeted by physicists with the question, 'How   is   David   Bohm   getting   along   with his   hidden   variables?' This shows a very   deep   misconception   of   what   Bohm   is trying   to   achieve   and ignores completely the radical   nature   of   his ideas. As we have   pointed out   before,   the   content   of   the   1952   papers   was   intended   simply   to show   that   there was   an   alternative   to   the accepted view.   They   were not   intended as   an   end   in themselves,   but   simply   to   open   the way for further progress.   To   go   beyond   hidden   variables   one   must   first see exactly   what   novel features   quantum   mechanics introduces,   and   to   do this   one   needs   to   consider   Bohr's   work   a little   more   closely. Perhaps   Bohr's   deepest perception .was   not   wave-particle duality, nor   cOlnplementarity,   but   l1'holeness.   Bohr   writes,   'The   essential wholeness   of   a   proper   quantum   phenomenon   finds   indeed   logical expression in   the   circumstances   that   any   attempt   at   its well-defined subdivision   would   require a   change   in   the experimental   arrangement incompatible with the   appearance   of   the   phenomenon   itself.'   27   Re- member   of   course   that   for   Bohr   the   word   'phenomenon   refers only   to observations   obtained   under   circumstances whose description includes an   account   of   the   whole experimental arrangement'.28 This   notion   of phenomenon   used   by   Bohr   is   different   from   its   more   customary meaning.   It   is   based   on   the   assumption   that   'in   quantum   mechanics, we   are   not   dealing with   an   arbitrary   renunciation   of   a   more   detailed analysis   of   atomic   phenomena,   but   with the recognition   that   such   an analysis is   in principle   excluded'.29 The   sentiments   expressed   in   these   quotations   are   sometimes summarised   in   the   phrase,   'the   inseparability   of   the observed   and   the observer'.   If   these   notions   are, in fact, correct   then   quite clearly some very deep questions as   to   the   nature   of   reality   are   raised, as   is   clearly recognised by   d'Espagnat.   11   Unfortunately   most   physicists either   do not   know   what   Bohr   wrote   or, if they do, they   do   not   quite   understand what   he   is   getting at.   When   various   quotations   of   Bohr's work   are put   to   them   they   tend   not   to   believe them, yet   continue   to   defend the usual   (Copenhagen)   interpretation!   They   praise Bohr,   but   think   like Einstein. As   we   have   remarked   already,   Bohm's   early perception when he began   thinking   seriously   about   physics was   to   notice the intercon-

            General introduction   11 nectedness   of   the process. When Bohm found Bohr was advocating an   extreme form   of   interconnectedness, he became very fascinated with this notion   and   explored it with much more energy.   What   turned   out to be   rather   surprising was   that   the   quantum   potential also contained a notion of wholeness, even though analysis was still possible. Thus the   quantum   potential approach, rather   than   refuting Bohr's position, actually supported it   on   the question of wholeness, a feature   that   was totally unexpected.   As   this   is   a very   important   feature   of   Bohm's ideas, we   feel   that   we   should try briefly to outline how these aspects emerge from the   quantum   potential approach. One   of the main difficulties in trying to   understand the   precise changes implied by   quantum   mechanics lies in the formalism itself.   It is   very different from   that   used in classical physics   and   consequently a comparison becomes very difficult. In order to bring the formalisms closer together   we   can   do   one   of   two things. (1) Either   we   can try to reformulate classical physics in terms   of   operators in Hilbert space and   hence   see   how   the   intuitive   classical   ideas   translate   into   the quantum   formalism. Such   an   approach has been adopted by Prigogine and   his co-workers. Perhaps the clearest introduction to their work   is presented in   Physica.   3o  (2)   Or   we   can try to reformulate   quantum   mechanics in a language which   is   closer to   that   of   classical physics. This   is   the essential feature of   Bohm's approach.   It   is   achieved in a very simple way by writing the wave function in the form:  t/J   =   R   exp   (is/h)  By   assuming   t/J   satisfies Schrodinger's equation one can obtain two real equations,   one   of   which   is   essentially a   classical equation   of motion   supplemented   by   an   additional   potential   term   (called   the quantum   potential).   It   is   this additional term alone   that   is   responsible for producing the   quantum   behaviour.   To   understand this equation you have to assume there   is   an   underlying micro-reality in which particles have   both   position   and   momentum, although these cannot be measured simultaneously. The solutions of the equation of motion give rise to   an   ensemble   of   individual particle trajectories arising from various initial conditions. If the distribution   of   initial conditions agrees with   that   calculated from the initial wave function, then this ensemble will give rise to the expected probability distributions found in ex- periment. This   is   guaranteed by the second equation derived from Schrodinger's equation, which   is   a continuity equation corresponding to the conservation   of   probability. The details   of   this approach are presented in the article by Vigier, Dewdney, Holland   and   Kyprianidis.   31   This article contains illustra- tions   of   the calculated trajectories for electrons incident   on   a two-slit screen (Figure 9.3, page 177).   It   will be immediately noticed   that   these trajectories are very different from those expected   on   purely classical

The   quantum   potential   approach   therefore   is   not an   attempt   to   return   to   classical physics. All the strange features are accounted for by the   quantum   potential, which   is   in   no   way like a classical potential. Before proceeding   to   discuss the difference between the classical   and quantum   potentials we   feel   it   is   necessary   to   point   out   an   essential difference between Bohm's   approach   and   that   of   Vigier   et   ale   which has caused some confusion.   To   Bohm   the   quantum   potential arises formally   from   the   mathematics   and,   in   order   to   demonstrate   the logical consistency   of   the whole approach, it   is   unnecessary to seek a deep explanation   of   the potential's physical origins.   In   fact all   of   the illustrations   of   how   the   quantum   potential   accounts   for   various quantum   phenomena   that   have   been   carried   through   recently   by Bohm   and   one   of   us (B. J. Hiley)   32,33,34,35   do   not   require any specific action   of   the underlying process.   In   all these cases there are   no   differ- ences with the results predicted by the usual approach. The   advantage   of   the   approach   even in the absence   of   a specific underlying process is   that   one   can   obtain   a   sharp   picture   of   what   is involved.   With   the trajectories, for example, we   can   see clearly how the   interference   pattern   arises.   In   transition   processes   the   time   of transition for a   particular   process   is   sharp. Aharonov   and   Albert   36 further illustrate this sharpness by raising the question of retrodiction in   quantum   mechanics, contrasting von   Neumann's   collapse postulate with the time-symmetry   of   the experimental probabilities. These issues are   rather   unclear in the usual formulation   but   they show how the quantum   potential   approach   gives a   much   clearer picture. This feature of clarity in Bohm's   approach   is   quite general   and   can   be regarded as one of its advantages. Naturally if   one   were to take the model as a definitive physical theory of   quantum   phenomena   one must seek a physical explanation of its origin. But here there are a wide variety   of   possibilities   and   Vigier   et   ale  have   adopted   a particular position in which they argue   that   the   quantum potential has its origins in 'non-locally correlated stochastic fluctuations of   an   underlying covariant ether'. However, many   of   the examples cited in their article   do   not   require such   an   assumption. Bohm's position with regard to the underlying process   is   very dif- ferent   and   depends   on   a much   more   radical approach.   Both   ideas stem from the recognition   that   the   many-body   approach   exhibits some form   of   'non-locality'   and   the difference arises from the interpretation of what this non-locality means.   For   Vigier the explanation   must   arise from some phase-like process in space-time; it can be regarded as a 'quasi-mechanical' explanation.   For   Bohm   the   quantum   non-locality has more   of   an   affinity with Bohr's   notion   of   'wholeness', which ulti- mately calls   into   question the very   notion   of   an   a priori   given space- time manifold.

            General introduction   13  In   order to   provide a context in   which   the   latter notions   take meaning,   we   will outline some of the key developments in which the notion   of   quantum   non-locality emerged. The first clear account of the nature of this   quantum   non-locality was presented by Schrod- inger   37   , using the   usual approach   of   quantum   mechanics.   He de- veloped the line started by Einstein, Podolsky   and   Rosen   38   in their well-known paper where they criticised the completeness of   quantum mechanics.   Schrodinger showed   that   there   was   what   he called   an "entanglement relation' appearing in the   quantum   formalism.   By   this he meant that the states   of   the subsystems cannot be separated from each other   and   this implied that, for a certain class   of   systems, the results   of   a measurement   of   a subsystem   A,   spatially well-separated from its companion   B,   depends   not   only   on   the results obtained at B  but on what one decided to measure at   B.   It   is   this last phrase that contradicts   our   usual notion   of   locality.   What   is   done to B should   not influence the result   of   a measurement   of   A,   especially when they are spatially separated   and   are   not   connected through a classical potential. Thus the usual formulation   of   quantum   mechanics sho\ved, in the hands   of   Schrodinger,   that   some notion   of   non-locality   is   involved. As   Dirac puts it, "For   an   assembly   of   particles   we   can set up field quantities which   do   change in a local way,   but   when   we   interpret them in terms   of   probabilities   of   particles   we   get again something which   is   non-local.'   39   However, because the usual approach cannot discuss the individual actual process, the question   of   locality becomes rather fuzzy   and   these questions can be conveniently ignored. The   quantum   potential approach shows quite clearly   that   for a cer- tain class   of   wave function, particles   that   are separated in space with no classical potential connecting them are   not   really separated but are connected through the   quantum   potential.   40   They are, as it were, "together yet apart'. Furthermore the   quantum   potential contains an instantaneous   connection   rather   than   the   expected   retarded   con- nection. In some ways this   is   like a reintroduction   of   a kind of action- at-a-distance,   a   feature   that   goes   against   the   whole   historical   de- velopment of physics. Einstein,   of   course, could   not   accept this way out   of   the paradox, insisting that 'physics should represent a reality in space-time, free from any spooky action   at   a distance'.41 In view of his position, it   is   not   surprising   that   he did not like the   quantum potential approach. John Bell noticed the non-locality but, rather   than   reject it outright, he raised the question of whether it was a particular defect of the quantum   potential approach   or   whether it was true for any model based   on   locality.42,43   By   assuming a pair of particles with dichotomic variables   and   by   proposing a   simple   and   reasonable definition   of locality, Bell was able to produce   an   inequality involving correlation functions which must be satisfied by a theory which   is   to be called 'local'.   Under   certain   conditions   quantum   mechanics   is   found   to

            14   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  violate this inequality, a fact   that   has been confirmed by a series of experiments which culminated in the work of Aspect   et   al. 44   Although the debate continues, focusing essentially   on   two questions: 1   whether Bell's notion of locality   is   too   restrictive; and 2   whether in fact the experiments actually measure what they intend to measure; there   is   a general   but   somewhat reluctant acceptance of the presence of some form of non-locality in   quantum   mechanics. This   reluctance   is   very   understandable since the   notion   that   all physical phenomena occur within a local reality   is   one of those self- evident truths   that   seem utterly absurd to contradict. Relativity itself, with its maximum signal velocity, has gone a long way to reinforce this notion. Even Dirac who, as   we   have seen, clearly recognised non- locality in   quantum   mechanics wrote,   "It   (non-locality)   is   against the spirit of relativity   but   it   is   the best   we   can do.'   39 No   one has yet suggested a way   of   accounting for the results of quantum   mechanics in a theory based   on   locality. Bohm, himself, with one   of   us   (B.   J.   Hiley)45, did propose a tentative local   but   non-linear theory   that   could in principle account for   quantum   non-locality,   but the assumptions   upon   which it was based implicitly required a radical view   of   nature in which process rather   than   particles-in-interaction was taken to   be fundamental.   But even this approach   is   far from satisfactory.   Some   authors   have noticed   that   one can escape from violating   the   Bell   inequalities   in   quantum   mechanics   by   allowing negative probabilities.   46   It   has generally been regarded   that   such a notion   is   meaningless   and   amounts   to   replacing   one difficulty   by another. But it   is   well known   that   negative probabilities arise else- where when one tries to   obtain   quantum   mechanical averages using phase-space distributions, so the question   of   negative probabilities   is not   restricted to the question of non-locality. Richard Feynman has thought   a great deal   about   these problems and, indeed, has admitted to having difficulty in trying to understand the world view   that   quan- tum mechanics represents. He has always tried to narrow the problem down to particular features   and   explore them in depth to try to learn something new.   In   this volume he re-examines the notion of negative probabilities   and   explores its possibilities.4 7 It   is   thus clear   that   quantum   non-locality   is   one of the most radical features of   quantum   phenomena   and   a careful discussion of its full implications   is   extremely important.   What   is   its relation to   Bohr's notion of wholeness?   Can   we   learn anything more from the   quantum potential approach?   One   important   factor in the discussion   is   that   if the   quantum   potential were simply a classical potential then there would, indeed, be violations of relativity   and   this would be strong grounds for rejecting the whole approach. But the essential point   is that   the   quantum   potential   is   not   like a classical potential. And the

            General introduction   15  pursuit   of   the   quantum   potential   approach   is   not   a   question   of 'jumping   out   of   the frying   pan   into the fire'.48   On   the contrary, what this   approach   does bring   out   ultimately   is   a clearer understanding of what   Bohr   was   referring   to   when   he   talked   about   'the   essential wholeness of a proper   quantum   phenomenon'   or   'a   closed indivisible phenomenon'. It   is   vital to bring   out   these points more clearly as they are a key feature   of   Bohm's thinking. He actually discusses these issues in his own article,   but   it   is   our   experience   that   people   do   not   generally fully grasp the significance of this radical feature of the   quantum   potential. We therefore make no apologies for repeating the arguments here. Unlike a classical potential, the   quantum   potential appears to have no point-like source. Moreover, since the field from which one derives the   potential   satisfies   a   homogeneous   equation,   the   field   is   not radiated, as   is,   for example, the electromagnetic field. But there are two further very   important   differences. 1   The   quantum   potential   does   not   produce,   in   general,   a vanishing interaction between two particles as the distance be- tween those particles becomes very large.   Thus   two distant sys- tems   may   still   be strongly   and   directly   connected.   This   is,   of course, contrary to the implicit requirement   of   classical physics, where it   is   always assumed   that   where two systems are sufficiently far   apart,   they   will   behave independently.   This   is   a   necessary condition if the notion   of   analysis   of   a system into separately   and independent existent constituent parts   is   to be carried out. Thus the   quantum   potential seriously calls into question the notion   that all explanations of complexity must be understood by considering independent systems in interaction with each other. 2   What   is   even more striking   is   that   the   quantum   potential   cannot be expressed as a universally determined function   of   all the co- ordinates   of   the particles. Rather it depends   on   the   'quantum   state'  t/J{rl   ...   r n )   of the   system   as a whole.   This means   that   even if   at some time the positions   and   momenta   of   two sets of particles are the same,   but   they are in different   quantum   states,   then   their subsequent evolution can be very different. All   of   this implies   that   the relationship between two particles depends on   something   that   goes beyond what can be described in terms of these two particles alone.   In   fact more generally, this relationship may depend   on   the   quantum   states   of   even larger systems, ultimately going on   to the universe as a whole. Within this view separation becomes a contingent rather   than   a necessary feature of nature. This   is   very different from   the way   we   perceive the macroscopic world   around   us, where separation seems basic. However, it   is   well known   that   when   we   go to low enough temperatures, bulk   matter behaves   very   differently.   Currents   flow   without   dissipation   in superconductivity, superfluids flow without viscosity, etc.,   but   as the

David Peat  temperature   rises,   the   distant   correlations   necessary   for   non-dis- sipation break   up   and   the particles   no   longer flow without resistance. If   we   regard these long-range correlations as stemming from   quantum non-locality, then they seem to be very fragile   and   can be broken quite easily, simply by raising the temperature.   In   fact it   is   this fragility that   makes it impossible to send signals in   EPR   situations. This   is another   way of explaining why a conflict with relativity   is   by no means necessary. But this fragility   is   not   always the case. The binding of electrons in atoms, covalent molecular bonds, etc., are much stronger. Nevertheless these, too,   can   be broken, provided enough energy   is   supplied. This could be either in the form   of   heat   or   chemical energy.   Thus   it   is   in thermodynamic systems   that   separability arises.   In   fact there seems to be a deep connection between irreversibility   and   the break-up pro- cesses,   but   the details are   not   clear. Prigogine   and   his   group   have studied the question of irreversibility in physical systems in great depth. Although most of this work has been concerned with classical systems, very wide-reaching results have been obtained, some of which have deep epistemological consequences.   In   his paper   with Elskens, Prigogine argues   that   in making the transition from dynamics to thermodynamics, the introduction of irreversibility   at   the microscopic level implies deep changes in the structure of space-time. Here irreversibility leads to a well-defined form of non-locality in which a single point in space-time   is   replaced by   an   ensemble of points giving rise to a geometry which contains a unique time order. Their   paper outlines the basic concepts   that   are involved in the new dynamics.   49 This new dynamics has   not   yet been used to address the question of how a breakdown   of   the correlations discussed above can occur. Nevertheless, it seems likely   that   it could provide a deeper understand- ing of the process involved,   not   only in breaking the correlations,   but also in establishing non-local correlations in systems   that   are far from equilibrium. Indeed Frohlich has recognised such a possibility   and   has conjectured   that   in   certain   dielectric   systems   longitudinal   electric oscillations may extend   over macroscopic distances,   giving   rise   to quantum   non-local correlations.   50   These effects are of particular inter- est in biological systems   and   are themselves maintained in equilibrium through a constant supply of energy,   i.e.   they are, like all living sys- tems, far from thermal equilibrium. But there are deeper problems for the application of   quantum   mechanics to biological systems.   One   such problem   is   raised by Frohlich in this volume; namely, can there also be non-locality in time?   51 Such questions are already implicit when   we   extend the notion of wholeness   to   relativistic   quantum   mechanics.   Here   relativity   puts space   and   time   on   an   equal footing so   that   non-locality in space sug- gests the possibility of non-locality in time. Such questions, in fact, have been discussed in Bohm's   group   but   their work in this area has

            General introduction   17 not   been published yet. Any meaningful discussion along these lines cannot   take   place   until   the   quantum   potential   approach   has   been applied   to   relativistic   quantum   mechanics. Some work, particularly by   Vigier's   group   in   Paris,   has explored   the   Klein-Gordon   52   and Dirac   53   equations   with some success.   However,   the   Klein-Gordon equation   produces difficulties even before one introduces the   quantum potential ideas.   Bohm   has long felt   that   the   best generalisation is through   relativistic field theories.   Thus   in   an   appendix   to   his   1952 paper,   Bohm   sketches   an   approach   to   the electromagnetic field. Here the   superwave   function   leads   to   a   generalised   Hamilton-Jacobi equation   containing a   super-quantum   potential in   addition   to   any classical potentials. This   equation   is   a field   equation   which, when the super-quantum   potential   is   neglected,   reduces   to   the   classical d'Alembert equation.   33 In   this   approach   the   quantum   field   may   be non-locally connected, so   that   instantaneous   effects   may   be carried from one   point   of   the field   to   another   distant   point.   As   with the non-relativistic case, it   can be shown   that   no   signal connecting   distant   events instantaneously   is possible, provided the measurements   that   would detect these signals are limited by the statistical   nature   of   the results   of   quantum   theory. This whole   approach   through   the   super-quantum   potential offers a new way   to   explain the   quantum   properties   of   fields. Here the energy may   spread   out   from   one   source, ultimately   to   focus   on   another   as a result   of   the non-local non-linear terms in the super-Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Thus, a quantised field is   not   basically a collection   of   indi- vidual   quanta   (i.e. particles); rather, it is a dynamical structure,   organ- ised by the   super-quantum   potential   so   that   it gives rise   to   discrete results, even   though   the process itself   is   not   discrete. The   relevance   of   this way   of   interpreting the theory   can   be seen even   more   clearly in the case   of   an   electromagnetic wave   that   is formed from interference   of   weak beams from two   independent   optical lasers as described by Pfleegor   and   Mandel.   54   The   photon   picture raises the unanswerable question: from which laser does the   photon   come? But in the   super-quantum   potential interpretation, there   is   no   problem because there   are   no   permanent   photons. There is only a total field   of activity   arising   from   both   lasers,   organised   non-linearly   and   non- locally by the   super-quantum   potential,   and   it is this feature   that   gives rise   to   the excitation   of   a single quantised transfer   of   energy   to   the detector.   35 All   of   this deals with   boson   field systems;   nothing   has been   done with fermion fields.   The   quantum   potential   approach   itself does   not include spin very happily.   Bohm   worked   on   this   problem   together with   Tiomno   and   Schiller   55   during   his stay in Brazil. They were able to   show   that   it is possible   to   obtain   a causal description   of   the Pauli equation. Bohm, himself, has   made   some   comments   on   the application of   the   quantum   potential   approach   to   the   Dirac   equation   but   the

David Peat  details have   not   been worked out.   56   Cufaro-Petroni   and   Vigier   57   have explored a possible approach using the Feynman-Gell-Mann equation for spin-half particles but, as yet, there   is   no method for discussing spin-half   fields.   The first tentative steps in this direction appear in this volume in   an   article by   John   Bell.   58   He argues for the exclusion of the notion   of   'observable'   and   the introduction   of   a beable whose existence does   not   depend   on   observation.   If   we   replace the three-space con- tinuum by a dense lattice   and   define a fermion number   operator   at each lattice point,   we   can regard the fermion numbers as local beables. The dynamics   is   replaced by a stochastic development of the fermion number configuration. Bell goes   on   to discuss the consequences of this model. For   many years Bohm himself never felt the need for a detailed exploration   of   these particular aspects   of   field theory. Rather he felt that   the novel nature   of   quantum   wholeness that emerged   both   from the   quantum   potential   and   Bohr's   work   required   a   radical   re- structuring   of   our   view of reality,   and   this could   not   be obtained simply by reworking everything in terms   of   the   quantum   potential and   the super-quantum potential. He has only recently returned to these topics, essentially for two reasons. 1   There   have   been   considerable   advances   in   experimental   tech- niques which have made possible   an   exploration of the founda- tions   of   quantum   mechanics using single particles   or   single-atom emitters. These experiments have raised the old issues again and, with the new generation struggling to make sense of these results in terms   of   the usual   quantum   mechanics, Bohm felt   that   a careful and   more detailed explanation of his original ideas sketched in his 1952 papers was needed. 2   Bohm has found, as he explains in his article, that it   is   now useful to re-examine those aspects   of   the super-quantum potential which offer a guide as to the limitations   that   must be imposed   on   the implicate order if it   is   to produce results   that   are not contrary to our   experience   of   quantum   phenomena. None of this should be taken as a return to the old model.   On   the contrary, it   is   to be seen as a way   of   explaining the deep nature of his new view   on   the nature   of   reality   that   has emerged from different explorations   that   he has made in the last twenty years. In order to bring these out, it   is   necessary to sketch how these views developed from the perception   of   the holistic view   that   quantum mechanics demanded. Since nearly all   our   habitual thinking involves analysis into independent entities   of   one kind   or   another interacting to form complex systems,   we   are faced with a very difficult problem. Do   we   follow Bohr   and   rule   out   any possibility of analysis in principle, thus leaving ourselves with   an   'algorism' from which   we   calculate the outcome of given experimental situations?   Do   we   restrict ourselves to the   quantum   potential approach trying to explain its origin in some

Where do   we   start? In order to motivate a point of departure let us look at   Bohr'ls position   and   try to see why he insisted   on   unanalysability. One strand of the argument involved what he called the 'finite   quantum   of action'. This notion arises from the uncertainty relation  ~x~p   ~   h  where   h   has the dimensions   of   the classical action. Thus the product of the uncertainties cannot be less   than   this 'finite   quantum   of action'. Bohr took this   to   imply   that   it was not possible to make a sharp distinction between the observer   and   the observed. It was like a blind man   with a rubber stick exploring a room.   By   feeling the reactions to his prodding stick he cannot obtain as sharp   an   image   of,   say, the walls of the room   than   he could have obtained with a rigid stick. The flexibility in the stick could   not   be 'calculated' away. There was   an indivisible,   uncontrollable   and   unpredictable   connection   between subject   and   object which rendered a sharp separation between the two impossible. The second strand   of   the argument involved regarding 'the concepts of classical physics as refinements of the concepts of daily   life   and   as an   essential   part   of   the language which forms the basis of all natural science'.   59 Thus, according to Bohr, classical concepts are inherent in all logical thinking.   As   Bohm writes: Such a point   of   view implies   that   every understandable   and describable aspect   of   experience could in principle be analysed by regarding the world as made   out   of various component parts, each having   at   any moment a definite position   and   a definite momentum. If   we   in practice   do   not   do   this in everyday   life   but   use other con- cepts instead, this means only   that   we   are approximating to the ideal of such a complete analysis.   60 But   quantum   mechanics   is   already suggesting   that   such   an   analysis   is in principle excluded. This, in turn, suggests   that   our   desire to pinpoint precisely, say,   the   positions of particles   is   not   necessary.   In   other words, could it not be   that   our   insistence   on   the use   of   a Cartesian co-ordinate system to describe physical processes   is   at   fault? After all, when   we   are describing the location   of   common objects,   we   resort to phrases like   'It   is   on   the table'   or   'It   is   on   the shelves   bet~'een   two books' etc. We hardly ever use a co-ordinate system   but   rely very much   on   topological relations. Could it then be   that   our   insistence on a co-ordinate description as opposed to a topological description   is leading   us   to   the conceptual problems in   understanding   quantum theory?

            20   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  It was in the late 1960s   that   the   group   at   Birkbeck began   an   ex- ploration of topological methods. This involved excursions into the mathematical techniques of homology   and   cohomology. At   that   stage few   physicists studied these mathematical disciplines, although there were   notable exceptions, including   John   Wheeler,   whose   lucid ex- planations   of   cohomology for   physicists were a   very great help in clarifying some   of   the questions involved.   61   It was   not   difficult to show that   many of the main laws   of   physics, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, Maxwell's equations   and   even the Dirac equation, could be given   a   very   simple   meaning   without   resorting   to   the   continuous space-time backcloth. There was one notable exception   and   that   was general relativity, which could   not   be expressed naturally in this topological language. But clearly a simple mathematical transcription was   not   sufficient, so Bohm began to investigate the notion   of   order   in a more general way. One   of his main investigations was to develop new principles of   order that   would replace those implied in the concept   of   continuity.62 One   such   idea   was   to   regard   the   particle   as   a   break   in   some background structure. Here one was exploiting the analogy of a dis- location in a crystal.   Frank   had   already shown   that   an   edge dis- location migrating through a crystal could be regarded as a particle having   an   effective mass, where the mass itself varies in the same way as mass varies in relativity,   but   now the speed   of   light   is   replaced by the speed of sound.   63   The fields themselves could be thought of as the stresses arising from the deformations caused by the presence of the dislocations. Bohm wanted to   abandon   the traditional notion   of   particles   and fields-in-interaction in a continuous space-time, replacing it by the notion of structure process.   That   is   to say one analyses all physical processes structurally, using as basic building blocks structures called simplexes (analogues   of   lines, triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) which could be   ordered,   boundary   to   boundary,   forming   a   structure   called   a simplicial complex. The failure of perfect fitting would then correspond to the presence of   matter   or   fields.   64 This type of   approach   through topo-chronology offers the possi- bility of being able to incorporate some notion of wholeness required by   quantum   mechanics. A particle could   not   be separated from the surrounding structure because what   is   called a particle   is   simply a break   in   the   background   structure.   Furthermore,   two   dislocations could   not   be separated since they are only breaks in the same struc- ture. Several attempts were made to use matrix representations to de- scribe these structures   but   it became very cumbersome. Indeed there have been many papers published in dislocation theory exploiting the analogies with continuum dynamics.   In   this volume two former re- search students, Peter Holland   and   Chris Philippidis, have exploited

            General introduction   21  and   generalised these ideas to show how   classical   electrodynamics can be   interpreted   as   a   theory   of a continuously   dislocated   covariant space-time ether.   One   of the   important   features   of   this work   is   to show in detail how the particle   and   field are seen as structurally in- separable even in the continuum limit.   65 But in order to get a better understanding   of   quantum   phenomena it was the discrete structure process   that   offered the better prospects. However, even here the structure seems   too   primitive to be carried very far. Time did   not   seem   to   be naturally   part   of the structure. The structure changed in time   but   was   not   of time. The whole approach seemed to be in the category of what Bergson called a cinemato- graphical outlook, a series   of   'stills' with no natural flow.   66 A vital clue   on   how to overcome this difficulty was provided by some experimental work   on   the   human   eye. Ditchburn had noticed that the eye was in continous vibration   and   that   this vibration was vital in order to see.   6 7   To   show this he fixed a mirror system to the eye so as to 'freeze'   out   the vibration. The result was   that   the eye could no longer see anything. Thus to see a line   or   boundary, for example, the eye must scan backwards   and   forwards across the line. The difference in the response in the retina as the eye crosses the line enables the brain to reconstruct the line. If the scanning   is   stopped, no line   is   seen, even though there   is   a static image   on   the retina. Thus, movement   is   basic to perception. But, equally, if there are no relatively invariant features for the eye to scan, then again nothing will be seen. So 'nothingness' does   not   mean there   is   nothing there; it could mean simply   that   there are no features   that   remain invariant for a sufficient length of time. Suppose now   we   carry through this idea   to   quantum   field theory where the vacuum state plays a basic role. We could argue   that   the vacuum state   is   not   empty,   but   is   in fact full of undifferentiated ac- tivity. This could then account for things like vacuum fluctuations which strongly suggest a vacuum state   is   far from empty. It could be full of activity   that   is   changing so rapidly   that   it cannot be perceived above a certain level. Could it therefore be   that   the structure described by the simplicial complex   is   merely the relatively invariant features of the basic underlying process   or   activity   or   what   we   call movement? Then in order to accommodate wholeness   we   regard this unbroken activity as the basic notion   and   what   our   physics discusses are the quasi-stable,   semi-autonomous   features   of   this   underlying   holo- movement. One   important   feature concerning the holomovement   is   that it   is not   described in space-time   but   from it space-time   is   to be abstracted. Thus   we   no longer start with   an   a priori   space-time manifold in order to discuss physics; rather,   we   construct space-time from the underlying process.   It   is   not, as Wheeler   and   Hawking suggests, a progression from the continuum via fluctuations   to   the space-time foam; rather, it

            22   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  is   the simplicial description   of   the relative invariant features   of   the holomovement   that   become   the   foam   from   which   the   continuous space-time   is   abstracted.   Thus   locality   is   no longer a primary concept but   is   also abstracted so   that   quantum   non-local correlations could be explained as a   remnant   of   the   basic underlying complex.   Fur- thermore 'staticness'   is   no longer a problem. The relatively invariant features can change as the underlying holomovement changes. It   is like Heraclitus' candle flame dancing   and   flickering, giving the appear- ance   of   an   autonomous   entity but, in fact, being constantly renewed. Ideas along these lines have also been suggested by David Fink- elstein   and   we   have been very stimulated by his unique way   of   looking at   things.   68   He acknowledges being influenced by Bohm's exploration of   structure process,   and   in his article 'All   is   flux'   69   he outlines some of   the   areas   of   cross   fertilisation   that   have   taken   place.   He   too proposes a simplicial   approach   to   quantum   theory, calling his basic structures   quantum   simplexes.   As   we   will see, the simplexes used to describe the holomovement are in fact algebraic and, in consequence, are   quantum   in origin. Thus   both   approaches   attempt   to abstract classi- cal space-time from   an   essentially   quantum   structure. Given the holomovement, it   is   now   but   a small step to the implicate order.   We   can   regard   the   relative   invariant   features   of   the   holo- movement   as   the explicate   order   while   that   which   remains in   the background   is   the implicate order.   What   is   missing   is   the notion of folding   and   enfolding,   and   that   has its source in three separate   and different developments. In   his   book   on   causality   and   chance, Bohm   had   already suggested that   the trajectories   that   emerged from   the   quantum   potential ap- proach were some kind   of   average property   of   a deeper process. He writes: Thus,   we   are led to a point   of   view rather like   that   suggested in section 2 in connection with the Brownian   motion   of   mist droplets near the critical point, namely   that   particle-like concentrations are always forming   and   dissolving.   Of   course, if a particle in a certain place dissolves, it is very likely to re-form nearby. Thus   on   the large-scale level, the particle-like manifestation remains in a small region   of   space following a fairly well-defined track, etc.   On   the other hand,   at   a lower level, the particle does   not   move as a permanently existing entity,   but   is   formed in a   random   way by suitable concentrations of the field energy.70 In   view   of   this statement   is   is   not   surprising   that   the unmixing (gly- cerine) demonstration Bohm saw   on   television provided a vital stimu- lus in arriving   at   the implicate   order   (see   Chapter   2 in this volume). In   this example the folding-unfolding idea emerges very clearly. Also from this example there appears a further principle; namely, that   not   everything can be unfolded together. Such   an   idea   is   already

            General introduction   23  present in perception, where a set   of   lines can   appear   to give one form or   another   but   never   both   together.   But in   physics   the   Cartesian notion   that   everything can be displayed together simultaneously has dominated, albeit implicitly, even though the appearance of   quantum mechanics with its sets   of   commuting operators calls this into ques- tion. There is a continual drive to find models in which all aspects of the process can be 'displayed' simultaneously.   In   the new view it   is necessary to distinguish between   that   which could be unfolded   to- gether (the explicate order)   and   that   which   remains enfolded   (the implicate order). Surely this   is   the deeper   truth   that   essentially lay behind   Bohr's   notion   of complementarity,   although   it   tended   to become trivialised into wave-particle duality. Perhaps   the   most   significant   stimulus   for   the   folding-unfolding notion came from a mathematical technicality, namely, the Green's function   approach   to Schrodinger's equation.   Feynman   first pointed out   that   in   quantum   mechanics, one can use the Huygens construction to determine the wave function   at   a point   y   from the wave function   at  {x},   where   {x}   is   the set of points   on   a surface   at   a previous time. Thus:  "'(y,12)   =   f   M(x,y,11,12)"'(x,11)dx  surface where   M(x,y,t   1 ,t 2)   is   a Green's function. Pictorially this   is   represented in Figure   1.1.   The wave function   at   all points of the surface   S   con- tributes to the wave function   at   y.   Thus   the information   on   the surface S is enfolded into   tjJ(y).   This   tjJ(y)   determines the   quantum   potential acting   on   the particle   at   y   so   that   the particle reacts to the enfolded information of a set of earlier wave functions.   In   turn   tjJ(y)   itself gets 'unfolded' into a series of points   on   a later surface   Sf   (see Figure 1.2). In   this way   we   see   that   the   quantum   potential itself   is   determined by an enfolding-unfolding process.  ~(x) ~(y)  S Figure   1.1

Then:  E 1  =   M-;lEM   1  If   we   assume: we   find Heisenberg's form   of   the Schrodinger   equation   follows immedi- ately.71   It   was a generalisation   of   arguments   of   this kind   that   led Bohm to suggest   that   the basic mathematics required   to   describe the implicate   order   will involve the use   of   matrix algebras.   Furthermore, although most physicists use the Hilbert space formalism for   quantum mechanics, there   is   an   equivalent formulation in terms   of   matrices, where the state functions are replaced by   appropriate   algebraic ideals. Thus   there   is   a   common   mathematical structure shared by   quantum mechanics   and   the implicate order: All   of   this,   and   a lot more,   is   ex- plained   in   more   detail   in   Bohm's   Wholeness   and   the   Implicate Order.   72  The   notion   that   the space-time   continuum   should   not   be taken as basic   notion   had   a   number   of   advocates   in   the   late   1960s.   They included Roger Penrose, who was then a   member'   of   the mathematics department   at   Birkbeck   College.   He   would   often take   part   in   the seminars run by the physics   department   and   explained to us his idea of   a 'spin network'   73   and   how he was hoping the twistor would play a   part   in generating these ideas.   74   At   about   the same time   we   were joined   by   a   research   student,   Fabio   Frescura,   who   carried   out   a detailed investigation of the algebraic   approach   and   showed   that   if one   took   the   direct   product   of a   suitable   Clifford   algebra   and   a

            General introduction   25  symplectic algebra (essentially the Heisenberg algebra supplemented by the   addition   of   a special element), one   could   bring   about   a complete algebraisation   of   quantum   mechanics   without   any   reference   to   a space-time continuum.   71   ,75   These algebras   are   essentially geometric algebras, the Clifford algebras carrying the   rotational   symmetries   and the symplectic algebra carrying the   translational   symmetries.   Thus they have within their structures all the required symmetry properties for   abstracting   the space-time continuum. Penrose's   approach   through   the spin   network   and   twistors   can   be given   an   algebraic flavour once   one   recognises   that   the non-relativistic spinor   is simply   an   ideal in the   Paul   Clifford algebra   (C   2)   while the twistor is a similar ideal in the conformal Clifford algebra   (C   6).   A discussion   of   the details   of   how   these similarities   can   be exploited would   not   be   appropriate   here   and   more   details   can   be found in the papers   of   Bohm   and   Hiley   76   and   Frescura   and   Hiley.71   The   essential consequence   of   this   approach   is   that   the simplicial complexes used to describe structures in the   holomovement   are essentially algebraic   and hence   can   be regarded as   quantum   in origin, as   are   the simplexes used by Finkelstein   that   we referred   to   earlier. Clive Kilmister has always been very encouraging in   our   explora- tions   of   the algebraisation   of   the implicate   order   and   his article in this volume investigates the   automorphism   group   of   C 4 ,   the   Dirac   Clifford algebra,   providing   some   simple   geometric   insights   present   in   this algebra.   77   These results are quite central   to   the work described above. In   the following   paper   Frescura   and   Hiley   78   indicate   that   the alge- braic   spinor   offers a generalization   of   the usual   approach   and   suggest how   this   can   be exploited in the extension which allows the algebra   to carry   a   structure   equivalent   to   curvature. We were very   happy   to   learn   that   Geoffrey Chew's work using   an S-matrix   approach   has found Bohm's implicate   order   a useful general scheme in which   to   bring   out   some   of   the features   of   his   approach. One   of   us (B.   J.   Hiley) still vividly remembers Chew's   1963 Rouse Ball lecture   'The   dubious   role   of   the space-time   continuum   in micro- scopic physics' which was eventually published in   Science Progress.   79  There he writes:   'but   a growing   number   of   us are reaching the con- clusion   that   to   make   major   progress we   must   stop   thinking   and   talk- ing   about   such   an   unobservable (space-time) continuum'.   The   main theme   of   the talk was   to   point   out   the advantages   of   the S-matrix over the   more   usual   quantum   field   approach.   (Perhaps   today   one could argue   that   the S-matrix describes various structures in the im- plicate order.)   In   the original talk the link between macroscopic space- time   and   the S-matrix was left as a challenge   about   which Chew said little except for a   rather   vague   remark   concerning the role   of   photons. This work has progressed considerably since those early days   and Chew explains in a very general way   how   the soft   photons   enable the macroscopic space-time   to   be   made   explicate.   8o   A colleague   of   Chew's,

            26   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  Henry Stapp, has also done a significant   amount   of work   on   questions arising from the S-matrix approach. He has also worked for a long time   on   the foundations   of   quantum   mechanics   and   has contributed significantly to the discussions   of   quantum   non-Iocality.81   In   his article he presents a simple model   that   incorporates lessons learned from the S-matrix.   82   He shows in detail how the classical concepts emerge from the 'soft'   photons   which are described by coherent states. So far   we   have concentrated mainly   on   physics   but   David Bohm's interest   and   influence extend far beyond physics   and   embrace biology, psychology, philosophy, religion,   art   and   the future of society.   His contributions   are   not,   however,   made   in   the   academic   sense   of someone who makes additions within the accepted, historical frame- work   of   a discipline   but   always in a creative way as one working from a new perspective based   on   the implicate order. It would be impossible even to summarise his contributions to the discussions over this wide range   of   topics. Rather   we   will let the contributors who have been influenced by him speak for themselves. Brian   Goodwin   sees Bohm as working in the same tradition as the Renaissance   mage   who   sought   a   unification   between   mind   and nature.   83   His vision   of   nature as   an   undivided whole could well be applied to biology,   Goodwin   argues, where it would counteract an 'atomistic (molecular) fragmentation' in favour of   an   approach that emphasises   the   wholeness   and   relational   order   of   the   organism. Goodwin, in his essay, discusses how a revolution in perspective could be achieved   and   suggests   that   our   current fragmentary view of the organism as divided between phenotype   and   genotype involved in genetic information processing be replaced by a theory of morpho- genetic fields. Robert   Rosen   also   discusses   biological   systems   and   raises   the question of the   relationship   of   physics to   biology.84 Does   biology simply require   an   application of the general laws of physics to complex systems   or   will new ideas   not   already present in physics be required? He argues for the latter, claiming   that   physics in its present form   is too narrow. This is in no sense a plea   to   introduce ideas of 'vitalism'; rather new concepts of   order   will be required, a theme   that   has a close relationship with Bohm's own thinking. With Bohm, new orders are required within physics. These new orders incorporate 'wholeness' and   here a more organic view of nature   is   required. Rosen suggests that   the study of the behaviour of macromolecules may provide a clue as to the nature of these orders. He uses the van der Waals gas to illustrate what he has in mind   and   shows how this can be re- analysed in the old Aristotelian categories of causation. This leads him to suggest a novel idea   that   each category of causation   is   reflected in a logically independent aspect of system description, thus implying that   it   is   no longer possible to think of a description purely in terms of states plus   dynamicalla   ws.

            General introduction   27  Maurice Wilkins, working   at   the macromolecular level in biologi- cal   systems,   found   that   the   complementary   aspects   of symmetry and   asymmetry seemed to be playing a crucial role. Again,   at   a differ- ent level, in   DNA   there seems to be a similar relationship   of   opposites between the precise replication of genes   and   the extensive rearrange- ment   that   now seems to   be necessary for evolution to take place. His article   85   explores from a very general point of view how com- plementarity arises in a number   of   disciplines ranging from physics, through biology, to the visual arts. Here complementarity   is   taken to imply a specific interaction between the parts   that   gives rise to whole- ness   or   perfection. He also asks whether any of the lessons learned can help with the problem   of   human   conflict, a problem that concerns Maurice very deeply in this nuclear age. In   his   The Special Theory   of   Relativity   86   Bohm gave considerable attention to the way in which   we   gain knowledge   about   the world. But this analysis was   not   carried   out   in a simple positivistic sense of building scientific theories   out   of   sense   data   but   rather in   an   attempt to understand how   our   concepts of reality grow   out   of   the dynamic activity   of   perception. During the 1960s, while working with one of his students, D. Schumacher, Bohm began to give emphasis to the role   of   language   and   communication in this process; indeed he has more recently chosen to describe it in united,   and   hyphenated, form as perception-communication. Following Bohr, Bohm discussed the role   of   informal   languages   in   scientific theories   of   nature   and   in- vestigated what   he felt   to   be a failure   in communication   between Einstein   and   Bohr himself. Bohm's interest in language led to the development   of   what   he called the rheomode, a language   of   communication more suited to his notions   of   enfolded order.   72   Alan Ford, stimulated by Bohm's writings on   physics   and   language, has attempted to forge a connection between linguistics   and   category theory, the latter topic being, in Bohm's view, the first step to creating any form   of   order.   87   As   we   have already seen, Bohm's researches came to fruition in the form   of   the implicate or   enfolded order and, more recently, generative orders. The essence of   the implicate order   is   a form   of   enfoldment such   that   any aspect of the system enfolds   and   is   interior to the whole. Clearly this idea of order   is   a far reaching one, with implications   that   extend far beyond current physics. Karl Pribram,88 for his part, explains how Bohm's insights enabled him to construct a holographic theory   of   the brain that   helped to resolve problems of non-local storage   and   the way in which spatial frequencies are resolved during vision.   Gordon   Globus acknuwledges the significance of Pribram's model in changing   our perspective   on   the brain,   but   attempts to go further with what he   cal~s  holonomy.   89   While the holographic approach assumes   an   essential   tabula rasa   into which the external environment   is   folded, Globus assumes that   the brain contains a plenum   of   possibilia.   Such   an   approach,

            28   B.   J.   Hiley and   F.   David Peat  Globus   feels,   makes   relevant   the   traditions   of mystIcIsm   with   its Godhead   as well as Western research   on   'altered states   of   conscious- ness'. Bohm's work has always held a particular fascination for the artist for, while the physics may be inaccessible, Bohm's essential   approach to   nature   is   sympathetic   to   their nature.   John   Briggs   90   explores the relationships between Bohm's theories   on   the ultimate structure of matter   and   his own views   on   the structure   of   a work   of   art. Briggs draws   attention   to   a particular aspect   of   the metaphor, which he calls a reflectaphor, in which each side reflects the   other   and   meaning lies in a continuing reflexive movement.   Through   an   analysis of poetry, the   short   story   and   painting,   Briggs concludes   that   in   its   deepest structure   a   work   of   art   is   built   not   on   explicit forms   but   out   of numerous   metaphors   that   are woven together in such a way   that   each one reflects all others.   Just   as each   part   of   nature   represents   an   en- foldment   of   the entire universe, so each   part   of   a work   of   art   reflects the whole. Clearly Briggs'   approach   gives insight into Bohm's conten- tion   that   a unity can exist between the artistic, scientific   and   religious mind. For   Montague   Ullman, Bohm's notions   of   enfolded   order   and   the non-local   nature   of   reality have a significant connection   to   dreams.   91  In   his   paper   he analyses the creative way in which images   and   events are woven together in the   dream   and   discusses its essential healing nature.   Ullman   also believes   that   dreams have a social   nature   and, indeed,   that   they have a survival value for the   human   race. Again there   is   evidence from amongst so-called primitive peoples   that   dreams fulfil   just   such a function.   Here   Ullman   touches   on   one of Bohm's current interests, for it   is   the latter's belief   that   a form   of   true co- operation   and   harmonious   society once existed   amongst   the   early hunter-gatherers   and   such 'leadership from behind' may even be pos- sible amongst   urban   society today.   To   what   extent dreams   playa   role in the creative cohesion   of   such groups is a   matter   for further in- vestigation. This   interest   in   dialogue   and   the   co-operative   activity   of   small groups   is   also explored by David Shainberg. Shainberg draws atten- tion to the way in which   human   consciousness erects fixed barriers to the dynamic process   of   enfolding   and   unfolding   that   is   characteristic of   the implicate order. Shainberg's discussion   92   of   the way in which thought   seeks security by fixing the   moment   in endless repetitions of jtself brings us close to the heart   of   Bohm's dialogues with the late Indian   philosopher J. Krishnamurti.   Bohm   met   Krishnamurti   in the early 1960s   and   since   that   time has held a   number   of dialogues in which the two thinkers have explored   many   issues together including the   nature   of   reality   and   the urgent need for a change in   human   conscious- ness. Shainberg traces the origins   of   these blocks in consciousness   and

            General introduction   29  discusses the various approaches   that   individuals have adopted when made aware of such a trap. In particular he explores the nature of private meditation   and   a form of group dialogue in which no position is   fixed   but   each participant   is   sensitive to the constant movement of thought   and   its tendency to seek security in fixed positions. Within such a dialogue it becomes possible for new insights to develop as relationships are constantly created anew. The final contribution in this collection   of   essays takes the form   of a dialogue between Renee Weber   and   David Bohm.   93   Renee Weber felt   that   the best way   that   she could contribute to this Festschrift was to   try   to   get   David   Bohm   to   explain   some   of the   philosophical ideas   that   arise in the implicate order. Recently Bohm has come to realise the importance of information   and   meaning,   not   only in the context of the   human   world,   but   also in the inanimate world.   For Bohm meaning   is   being   and   meaning   is   the essence   of   reality. These ideas are very different from   our   normal way   of   thinking   and   seem to be essential in the context   of   wholeness.   What   Renee Weber does in the dialogue   is   to bring   out   the thinking   that   lies beyond these ideas. David Bohm has argued   that   the essence   of   the scientific mind   is the ability to see the fact no   matter   what it says. This fearlessness   and passion   of   the intelligence characterises all   of   David Bohm's work   and explains its far-reaching attraction for so many   of   the contributors gathered   here.   For   reasons   of   space   they   represent   only   a   small selection   of   researchers, thinkers, writers   and   artists who could have contributed to this volume. Clearly David Bohm's ideas have influ- enced a wide audience   and   stimulated much discussion which   has helped to create new insights   and   lead   to   an   essentially unified vision of   nature in which artist, scientist   and   religious thinker are no longer divided. Even more significant, perhaps,   is   the hope   that   individuals may come together in a spirit   of   creative co-operation to build a world in   which   undivided   wholeness   and   creative   order are   an   essential ground.

            2  Hidden   variables and   the implicate   order   l  David Bohm   Birkbeck College, University   of   London  I have been asked   to   explain   how   my ideas   of   hidden variables tie   up with those   on   the implicate order,   and   to   bring   out   in some detail how   both   these two   notions   are   related.   In   doing this, it would perhaps be best   to   begin with   an   account   of   how I came to these ideas in the first place. The   whole development   started   in   Princeton   around   1950, when I had   just   finished my   book   Quantum Theory.2   I   had   in fact written it from   what   I regarded as Niels Bohr's   point   of   view, based   on   the principle   of   complementarity.3 Indeed, I   had   taught   a course   on   the quantum   theory for three years   and   written the   book   primarily in order   to   try   to   obtain   a   better   understanding   of   the whole subject, and   especially   of   Bohr's very deep   and   subtle   treatment   of   it. However, after the   work   was finished, I   looked   back over   what   I   had   done   and still felt somewhat dissatisfied. What   I felt   to   be especially unsatisfactory was the fact   that   the quantum   theory   had   no   place in it for   an   adequate   notion   of   an   in- dependent actuality - i.e.   of   an   actual movement   or   activity by which one physical state could pass over   into   another.   My   main   difficulty was   not   that   the   wave   function   was   interpreted   only   in   terms   of probabilities,   so   that   the   theory   was   not   deterministic;   rather, it   was   that   it   could   only   be   discussed   in   terms   of   the   results   of an   experiment   or   an   observation, which has   to   be treated as a set of   phenomena   that   are   ultimately   not   further   analysable   or explainable   in   any   terms   at   all.   So,   the   theory   could   not   go beyond   the   phenomena   or   appearances.   And,   basically,   these phenomena   were   very   limited   in   nature,   consisting,   for   example, of   events   by   which   the   state   of   a   particle   could   be   ascertained. From   a   knowledge   of   this   state   we   could   go   to   a   wave   function 33

            34   David Bohm  that   predicted the probability   of   the next set   of   phenomena,   and   so on. On   thinking   about   what   all this meant, it began   to   occur to me that   the   quantum   theory might actually be giving a fragmentary view of   reality. A wave function seemed   to   capture only certain aspects   of what happens in a statistical ensemble   of   similar measurements, each of   which   is   in essence only a single element in a greater context   of the overall process.   Though   von   Neumann   4   had   given what   purported to be a   proof   that   to go any further would   not   be compatible with the quantum   theory (which was already very well confirmed indeed), I still   realized   that   mathematical   proofs   are   based   on   axioms   and presuppositions   whose   meanings   are   often   obscure   and   always   in principle open to question. Moreover, the theory   of   relativity, which was also   regarded as fundamental,   demanded   a space-time process (e.g. one   that   could be understood in terms   of   fields) which constituted an   independent actuality,   with a continuous   and   determinate con- nection   between all its parts. Such a process could not   be treated solely   as   a   set   of   fragmentary   phenomena   that   are   related   only statistically. This   requirement   becomes   especially   urgent   when   relativity   is extended to include cosmology.   It   seems impossible even to contem- plate the universe as a whole   through   a view which can discuss only in   terms   of   discrete   or   distinct   sets   of   phenomena,   for   in   a   cos- mological view the observing instruments,   and   indeed the physicists who construct   and   operate   them,   have   to   be   regarded   at   least   in principle as   parts   of   the totality. There does   not   seem to be much sense in saying   that   all these are nothing   more   than   organized sets of appearances.   To   whom   or   to what would they appear,   and   of what would they be the appearances? I felt particularly dissatisfied with the self-contradictory attitude   of accepting the independent existence   of   the cosmos while one was doing relativity and,   at   the same time, denying it while one was doing the quantum   theory, even   though   both   theories were regarded as fun- damental. I did   not   see how   an   adequate   way   to   deal with this could be developed   on   the basis   of   Niels Bohr's point   of   view. So I began to ask myself whether   another   approach   might   not   be possible. In my first   attempt   to   do   this I considered a   quantum   mechanical wave function representing, for example,   an   electron,   and   supposed that   this was scattered by   an   atom. By solving Schrodinger's   equation for the wave function, one shows   that   the scattered wave will spread out   more   or   less spherically. Nevertheless, a detector will detect   an electron in some small region   of   space, while the extended spherical wave gives only the probability   that   it will be found in any such region. The idea then occurred to me   that   perhaps there   is   a second wave coming in   toward   the place where the electron   is   found,   and   that   the mathematical calculus   of   the   quantum   theory gives a statistical rela- tionship between outgoing   and   incoming waves.

            Hidden variables   and   the in1plicate order   35  However, to think this way requires   that   we   have to enrich   our concepts to include   an   incoming wave as well as   an   outgoing wave. Indeed, since further measurements can be made   on   the electron, it follows that, as the second wave spreads out, it may give way to a third,   and   so on.   In   this way, it becomes possible to have   an   ongoing process   in   which   the   electron   is   understood   as   an   independent actuality (which will, of course, give rise to phenomena through which it may be detected).   One   is   thus implying   that   the current   quantum theory deals only with a fragmentary aspect of this whole process - i.e.   that   aspect which   is   associated with a single observational event. It seems clear   that   at   this stage I was anticipating what later became the implicate order. Indeed, one could say   that   ingoing   and   outgoing waves are enfolding   and   unfolding movements. However, I did not pursue this idea further   at   the time.   What   happened was   that   I   had meanwhile sent copies of my   book   to Einstein, to Bohr, to Pauli   and to a   few   other physicists. I received no reply from Bohr,   but   got an enthusiastic response from Pauli. Then I received a telephone call from Einstein, saying   that   he wanted to discuss the book with me. When we   met, he said   that   I   had   explained Bohr's point of view as well as could probably be done,   but   that   he was still   not   convinced.   What came   out   was   that   he felt   that   the theory was incomplete,   not   in the sense   that   it failed to be the final   truth   about   the universe as a whole, but   rather   in the sense   that   a watch   is   incomplete if an essential   part is   missing. This was,   of   course, close to my more intuitive sense   that the theory was dealing only with statistical arrays of sub-processes associated   with   similar observational   events.   Einstein felt   that   the statistical predictions of the   quantum   theory were correct,   but   that   by supplying   the   missing   elements   we   could   in   principle   get   beyond statistics to   an   at   least in principle determinate theory. This encounter with Einstein   had   a strong effect   on   the direction of my research, because I then became seriously interested in whether a deterministic extension of the   quantum   theory could be found. In this connection I soon thought of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory, which   relates   waves   to   particles   in a fundamental   way.   Indeed,   it had   long been known   that   when one makes a certain approxima- tion   (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin),   Schrodinger's   equation   becomes  equival~nt   to   the   classical   Hamilton-Jacobi equation.   At   a   certain point 1 4   asked myself:   What   would happen, in the demonstration of this equivalence, if   we   did   not   make this approximation? I saw immedi- ately   that   there would be   an   additional potential, representing a new kind   of   force,   that   would be acting   on   the particle. I called this the qbantum   potential, which was designated by   Q.  This gave rise directly to what I called a causal interpretation of the   quantum   theory.5,6 The basic assumption was   that   the electron   is   a particle, acted   on   not   only by the classical potential,   V,   but   also by the   quantum   potential,   Q.   This latter   is   determined by a new kind of

            36   David   Bohm  wave   that   satisfies Schrodinger's   equation.   This wave was assumed, like the particle,   to   be   an   independent   actuality   that   existed   on   its own,   rather   than   being merely a function from which the statistical properties   of   phenomena   could   be derived. However, I showed   on   the basis   of   further physically   reasonable   assumptions   that   the intensity of   this wave is   proportional   to   the   probability   that   a particle   actually is   in the   corresponding   region   of   space   (and   is   not   merely the   prob- ability   of   our   observing   the   phenomena   involved in   finding   a particle there). So the wave function   had   a   double   interpretation   -   first as a function   from   which   the   quantum   potential   could   be derived   and, secondly, as a function from which probabilities   could   be derived. From   these   assumptions   I   was   able   to   show   that   all   the   usual results   of   the   quantum   theory   could   be   obtained   on   the basis   of   a model   incorporating   the   independent   actuality   of   all its basic elements (field   and   particle),   as   well   as   an   in   principle   complete   causal determination   of   the   behaviour   of   these elements in terms   of   all the relevant   equations   (at   least in a one-particle system, which   is   as far as I   had   got   at   the time). I sent   pre-publication   copies   of   this   work   to   various physicists.   De Broglie quickly sent me a   reply indicating   that   he   had   proposed   a similar   idea   at   the   Solvay   Congress   in   1927,   but   that   Pauli   had severely criticized it   and   that   this   had   led him   to   give it up.   Soon   after this I received a letter from Pauli,   stating   his objections in detail. These had   mainly   to   do   with the many-particle system, which I   had   not   yet considered seriously. However, as a result   of   these objections, I   looked at   the   problem   again   and   came   out   with a   treatment   of   the   many- particle   system   which   consistently   answered   Pauli's   criticisms.   In doing   this, I also developed a   theory   of   the   process   of   measurement which gave   an   objective   account   of   this process,   without   the need for the   arbitrary   and   unexplained 'collapse'   of   the   wave function   that   was implied in the usual   interpretation   of   the theory.7 A   more   detailed   consideration   of   this extended   theory   led me   to look   more   carefully   into   the   meaning   of   the   quantum   potential. This had   a   number   of   interesting new features.   Indeed, even in the one- particle   system   these   features   showed   up   to   some   extent,   for   the quantum   potential   did   not   depend   on   the   intensity   of   the   wave associated   with   this electron; it   depended   only   on   the   .form   of   the wave.   And   thus, its effect   could   be large even when the wave   had spread   out   by   propagation   across large distances.   For   example, when the   wave   passes   through   a   pair   of   slits,   the   resulting   interference pattern   produces   a   complicated   quantum   potential   that   could   affect the particles far from   the   slits in such a way as   to   'bunch'   them   into   a set   of   fringes equivalent   to   those   predicted in   the   usual interpene- tration   of   the   quantum   theory.8   Thus,   by   admitting   that,   even in   an 'empty'   space in which there is   no   classical potential,   the   particle   can be acted   on   by a   quantum   potential   that   does   not   fall off with the

            Hidden variables and the implicate order   37  distance, one   is   now able to explain the well-known wave particle duality of the properties of matter. And by noting   that   this   quantum potential can generally have a major effect   on   the particle,   an   effect that   indeed reflects the whole environment, one can obtain a further insight into the crucially significant new feature of wholeness   of   the electron   and   its relevant experimental context, which Bohr   had   shown to be implicit in the   quantum   theory. When one looked   at   the many-particle system, this new kind of wholeness became much more evident, for the   quantum   potential was now a function   of   the positions   of   all the particles which (as in the one-particle case) did   not   necessarily fall off with the distance. Thus, one could   at   least in principle have a strong   and   direct (non-local) connection between particles   that   are quite distant from each other. This sort of non-locality would, for example, give a simple   and   direct explanation   of   the   paradox   of   Einstein, Podolsky   and   Rosen, because in   measuring   some   property   of   one   of   a   pair   of   particles   with correlated   wave   functions,   one   will   alter   the   'non-local'   quantum potential so   that   the other particle responds in a corresponding way. Because the above response   is   instantaneous, however, it would seem at first sight to contradict the theory of relativity, which requires that   no signals be transmitted faster   than   the speed   of   light. At the time of proposing these notions I regarded this as a serious difficulty, but   I hoped   that   the problem would ultimately be resolved with the aid of further new orders. This indeed did happen later in connection with   the   application   of   the   causal   interpretation   to   the   quantum mechanical field theory,   but   as this question   is   not   relevant to the subject   of the   present   paper,   I   shall   not   discuss   it   further   here.   9 Meanwhile, however, I felt that the causal interpretation was affording valuable insight into a key difference between classical   and   quantum properties of matter.   Classically, all forces   are assumed   to fall   off eventually   to   zero,   as   particles   separate,   whereas in   the   quantum theory the   quantum   potential may still strongly connect particles   that are even   at   macroscopic orders of distance from each other.   In   fact, it was just this feature of the   quantum   theory, as brought   out   in the causal interpretation,   that   later led Bell!   0   to   develop his theorem, demonstrating   quite   precisely   and   generally   how   quantum   non- locality contrasts with classical notions   of   locality. As   important as this new feature of non-local connection   is,   how- ever, the   quantum   potential implies a further move away from classical concepts   that   is   yet more radical   and   striking. This   is   that   the very form of the connection between particles depends   on   the wave function for the state of the whole. This wave function   is   determined by solving Schr6dinger's equation for the entire system,   and   thus does   not   depend on   the state of the parts. Such a behaviour is in contrast to that shown in classical physics, for which the interaction between the parts   is   a predetermined function, independent   of   the state   of   the whole. Thus,

            38   David Bohm  classically, the whole   is   merely the result of the parts   and   their pre- assigned interactions, so   that   the primary reality   is   the set of parts while the behaviour   of   the whole   is   derived entirely from those parts and   their   interactions.   With   the   quantum   potential,   however,   the whole has   an   independent   and   prior significance such that, indeed, the whole may be said to organize the activities of the parts.   For example, in a superconducting state it may be seen   that   electrons are not   scattered because, through the action of the   quantum   potential, the whole system   is   undergoing a co-ordinated movement more like a ballet dance   than   like a crowd of unorganized people. Clearly, such quantum   whol~ness   of   activity   is   closer to   the   organized   unity   of functioning   of   the   parts   of   a living being   than   it   is   to the kind   of   unity that   is   obtained by putting together the parts   of   a machine. If the whole   is   such a primary notion in the   quantum   theory, how do   we   account for   our   usual experience   of   a world made up   of   a vast set of essentially independent parts   that   can   correctly be understood in terms of ordinary mechanical notions? The possibility   of   accounting for this   is   grounded in the fact   that   when the wave function reduces to a set   of   constituent factors, the   quantum   potential reduces to a sum of independent components.   As   a result, the activity of the whole reduces to   that   of   a set of independent sub-wholes.   As   explained in detail elsewhere,   11   under conditions of temperature commonly found on   the large-scale level, such factorization comes   about   in   an   entirely objective way, depending neither   on   our   knowledge   nor   on   the exist- ence   or   functioning   of   any kind of observing   or   measuring apparatus. Nevertheless, more generally (especially   on   the small-scale level but, under suitable conditions, as for example in superconductivity, also on   a larger-scale level), it   is   an   equally objective implication of the theory   that   the wave function does   not   factorize, so   that   the whole cannot   then be divided into independent sub-wholes. To   sum up, then, the   quantum   potential   is   capable of constituting a non-local connection, depending directly   on   the state of the whole in a way   that   is   not   reducible to a preassigned relationship   among   the parts.   It   not   only determines   an   organized   and   co-ordinated activity ofwhole sets ofparticles,   but   it also determines which relatively independ- ent sub-wholes, if any, there may be within a larger whole. I want to emphasize   again   how   radically   new   are   these   implications   of the quantum   theory. They are hinted   at   only vaguely   and   indirectly by the subtle arguments   of   Bohr, based   on   the usual interpretation   of   the quantum   theory as nothing more   than   a set   of   mathematical formulae yielding   statistical   predictions   of   the   phenomena   that   are   to   be obtained in physical observations. However, by putting   quantum   and classical theories in terms   of   the same intuitively understandable con- cepts (particles moving continuously under the action   of   potentials), one   is   able to   obtain   a clear   and   sharp perception   of   how the two theories differ. I felt   that   such   an   insight was   important   in itself, even

            Hidden variables and the implicate order   39  if,   as seemed likely   at   the time   that   I proposed it, this particular model could   not   provide the basis for a definitive theory   that   could undergo a sustained development. However, a clear intuitive understanding of the meaning   of   one's ideas can often be helpful in providing a basis from which may ultimately come   an   entirely new set of ideas, dealing with the same content. These proposals did   not   actually 'catch   on'   among physicists. The reasons are quite complex   and   difficult to assess. Perhaps the main objection was   that   the theory gave exactly the same predictions for all experimental results as does the usual theory. I myself did not give much weight to these objections. Indeed, it occurred to me that if de Broglie's ideas had won the day   at   the Solvay Congress   of   1927, they might have become the accepted interpretation; then, if someone had come along to propose the current interpretation, one could equally well have said   that   since, after all, it gave no new experimental results, there would be no point in considering it seriously.   In   other words, I felt   that   the adoption of the current interpretation was a somewhat fortuitous affair, since it was affected   not   only by the outcome   of   the Solvay Conference   but   also by the generally positivist empiricist atti- tude   that   pervaded physics   at   the time. This attitude   is   in many ways even stronger today,   and   shows up in the fact   that   a model   that   gives insight without   an   'empirical pay-off'   cannot   be taken seriously. I did try to answer these criticisms to some extent by pointing out that the enriched conceptual structure   of   the causal interpretation was capable of modifications   and   new lines of development   that   are not possible in the usual interpretation.   12   These could, in principle, lead to new empirical predictions,   but   unfortunately there was no clear indication of how to choose such modifications from among the vast range that was possible. And so these arguments   had   little effect as   an answer to those who require a fairly clear prospect   of   an   empirical test before they will consider   an   idea seriously. In addition, it was   important   that   the whole idea did   not   appeal to Einstein, probably mainly because it involved the new feature of non- locality,   which   went   against   his   strongly-held   conviction   that   all connections had   to   be local. I felt this response of Einstein was par- ticularly unfortunate,   both   during the Solvay Congress   and   afterwards, as it almost certainly   'put   off' some of those who might otherwise have been interested in this approach. Although I saw clearly at the time that the causal interpretation was not entirely satisfactory, I felt that the insight   that   it afforded was   an   important reason why it should be considered, at least as a supplement to the usual interpretation.   To have some kind of intuitive model was better, in my view,   than   to have none at all, for, without such a model, research in the   quantum theory will consist mainly of the working   out   of formulae   and   the comparison of these calculated results with those of experiment. Even more important, the teaching of   quantum   mechanics will reduce (as it

Thus new generations   of   students have grown up who are predisposed to consider such questions with   rather   closed minds. Because the response to these ideas was so limited,   and   because I did   not   see clearly,   at   the time, how to proceed further, my interests began to   turn   in   other   directions.   During   the 1960s, I began to direct my attention   toward   order,   partly as a result   of   a long correspondence with   an   American artist, Charles Biederman, who was deeply con- cerned with this question. And then,   through   working with a student, Donald   Schumacher, I became strongly interested in   language.   These two interests led to a   paper   13   on   order   in physics   and   on   its de- scription through language.   In   this   paper   I compared   and   contrasted relativistic   and   quantum   notions of order, leading to the conclusion that   they contradicted each   other   and   that   new notions of   order   were needed. Being thus alerted to the importance   of   order, I saw a programme on   BBC television showing a device in which   an   ink   drop   was spread out   through a cylinder   of   glycerine   and   then   brought   back together again, to be reconstituted essentially as it was before. This immediately struck me as very relevant to the question   of   order, since, when the ink   drop   was spread out, it still   had   a 'hidden' (i.e. non-manifest)   order that   was revealed when it was reconstituted.   On   the   other   hand, in our   usual language, we would say   that   the ink was in a state of 'dis- order' when it was diffused through the glycerine. This led me to see that   new notions   of   order   must be involved here. Shortly afterwards, I began to reflect   on   the hologram   and   to see that   in it, the entire   order   of   an   object   is   contained in   an   interference pattern of light   that   does   not   appear   to have such   an   order   at   all. Suddenly, I was struck by the similarity of the   hologram   and   the behaviour   of   the ink drop. I saw   that   what they   had   in   common   was that   an   order   was   enfolded;   that   is,   in any small region   of   space there may be 'information' which   is   the result   of   enfolding   an   extended order and   which could then be unfolded into the original   order   (as the points of contact made by the folds in a sheet   of   paper may contain the essential relationships of the total   pattern   displayed when the sheet   is unfolded). Then, when I   thought   of   the mathematical form   of   the'   quantum theory (with its matrix operations   and   Green's functions), I perceived that   this   too   described   just   a movement   of   enfoldment   and   unfoldment of the wave function.   So the   thought   occurred to   me:   perhaps the movement   of enfoldment   and   unfoldment   is   universal,   while   the extended   and   separate forms   that   we   commonly see in experience are relatively stable   and   independent patterns, maintained by a constant underlying movement   of   enfoldment   and   unfoldment.

            Hidden variables   and   the implicate order   41  idea. Instead of supposing   that   extended   matter   and   its movement are fundamental, while enfoldment   and   unfoldment are explained as as particular case of this,   we   are saying   that   the implicate   order   will have to contain within itself all possible features   of   the explicate   order   as potentialities, along with the principles determining which of these features shall become actual. The explicate   order   will in this way flow out   of   the implicate   order   through unfoldment, while in   turn   it 'flows back' through further enfoldment. The implicate   order   thus plays a primary role, while the explicate   order   is   secondary, in the sense   that its   main   qualities   and   properties   are   ultimately   derived   in   its   re- lationship with the implicate order, of which it   is   indeed a special and   distinguished case. This approach implies,   of   course,   that   each separate   and   extended form in the explicate   order   is   enfolded in the whole   and   that, in turn, the   whole   is   enfolded in this form   (though,   of   course,   there   is   an asymmetry, in   that   the form enfolds the whole only in a limited   and not   completely defined   way).   The   way   in   which   the   separate   and extended form enfolds the whole   is,   however,   not   merely superficial   or of secondary significance,   but   rather it   is   essential to what   that   form   is  and   to how it acts, moves   and   behaves quite generally. So the whole is,   in a deep sense,   internally   related to the parts. And, since the whole enfolds all the parts, these latter are also internally related, though in a weaker way   than   they are related to the whole. I shall not go into great detail   about   the implicate order   14.15   here~  I shall assume   that   the reader   is   somewhat familiar with this.   What   I want to emphasize   is   only   that   the implicate   order   provided   an   image, a kind   of   metaphor, for intuitively understanding the implication of wholeness which   is   the most   important   new feature of the   quantum theory. Nevertheless, it must be pointed   out   that   the specific analogies of the ink   drop   and   the hologram are limited,   and   do   not   fully convey all   that   is   meant by the implicate order.   What   is   missing in   these analogies   is   an   inner principle of organization in the implicate order that   determines which sub-wholes shall become actual   and   what will be their relatively independent   and   stable forms. Indeed, in   both   these models, the order enfolded in the whole   is   obtained from pre-existent, separate   and   extended   elements   (objects   photographed   in   the hologram   or   ink drops injected into the glycerine). It   is   then merely unfolded to give something similar to these elements again.   Nor   is there any natural principle   "of   stability in these elements; they may be totally altered   or   destroyed :by minor further disturbances of the over- all arrangement of the equipment. Gradually,   throughout   the   1970s,   I   became   more   aware   of the limitations of the hologram   and   ink droplet analogies to the implicate order.   Meanwhile, I noticed   that   both   the implicate   order   and   the causal   interpretations   had   emphasized   this   wholeness   signified   by quantum   laws,   though   in   apparently   very   different   ways.   So   I

            42   David Bohm  wondered if these two rather different approaches were   not   related in some deep sense - especially because I   had   come   at   least to the essence of   both   notions   at   almost the same time. At first sight, the causal interpretation seemed   to   be a   step backwards   toward   mechanism, since it introduced the notion of a particle acted   on   by a potential. Nevertheless, as I have already pointed out, its implication   that   the whole   both   determines   its   sub-wholes   and   organizes   their   activity clearly goes far beyond what appeared to be the original mechanical point of departure. Would it   not   be possible to   drop   this mechanical starting point altogether? I saw   that   this could indeed be done by going   on   from the   quantum mechanical particle theory to the   quantum   mechanical field theory. This   is   accomplished by starting with the classical notion of a continu- ous field (e.g. the electromagnetic)   that   is   spread   out   through all space. One   then applies the rules of the   quantum   theory to this field. The result   is   that   the field will have discrete "quantized' values for certain properties, such as energy,   momentum   and   angular momentum. Such a field will act in many ways like a collection of particles, while   at   the same time it still has wave-like manifestations such as interference, diffraction, etc. Of   course, in the usual interpretation of the theory, there   is   no way to understand how this comes about.   One   can only use the math- ematical formalism to calculate statistically the distribution of phenom- ena through which such a field reveals itself in   our   observations   and experiments. But now one can extend this causal interpretation to the quantum   field theory. Here, the actuality will be the entire field over the whole universe. Classically, this   is   determined as a continuous solu- tion of some kind of field equation (e.g. Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field). But when   we   extend the notion of the causal interpretation to the field   theory,   we   find   that   these equations are modified by the action of what I called a super-quantum potential. This   is   related   to   the activity of the entire field as the original   quantum potential was to   that   of the particles.   As   a result, the field equations are modified in a way   that   makes them, in technical language, non- local   and   non-linear. What   this implies for the present context can be seen by considering that, classically, solutions of the field equations represent waves   that spread   out   and   diffuse independently. Thus, as I indicated earlier in connection with the hologram, there   is   no   way to explain the origi- nation of the waves   that   converge to a region where a particle-like manifestation   is   actually detected,   nor   is   there any factor   that   could explain the stability   and   sustained existence of such a particle-like manifestation. However, this lack   is   just   what   is   supplied by the super- quantum   potential. Indeed, as can be shown by a detailed analysis,6,7 the non-local features of this latter will introduce the required tend- ency   of waves   to   converge   at   appropriate   places,   while   the   non-

            Hidden variables   and   the implicate order   43  linearity will provide for the stability   of   recurrence   of   the whole pro- cess. And thus   we   come to a theory in which   not   only the activity   of particle-like   manifestations,   but   even   their   actualization,   e.g.   their creation,   sustenance   and   annihilation,   is   organized   by   the   super- quantum   potential. The general picture   that   emerges   out   of   this   is   of   a wave   that   spreads out   and   converges again   and   again to show a kind   of   average particle- like behaviour, while the interference   and   diffraction properties are, of course, still maintained. All this flows   out   of   the super-quantum po- tential, which depends in principle   on   the state of the whole universe. But if the 'wave function   of   the universe' falls into a set of independent factors,   at   least approximately, a corresponding set of relatively auton- omous   and   independent sub-units   of   field function will emerge. And, in fact, as in the case in the particle theory, the wave function will under normal conditions tend to factorize   at   the large-scale level in an   entirely objective way   that   is   not   basically dependent   on   our   know- ledge   or   on   our   observations   and   measurements. So now   we   see quite generally   that   the whole universe   not   only determines   and   organizes its sub-wholes,   but   also   that   it gives form   to   what has until now been called the elementary particles   out   of which everything   is   supposed to be constituted.   What   we   have here   is   a kind of universal process of constant creation   and   annihilation, determined   through   the   super- quantum   potential so as to give rise to a world of form   and   structure in which all manifest features are only relatively constant, recurrent and   stable aspects   of   this whole. To   see how this   is   connected with the implicate order,   we   have only to note   that   the original holographic model was one in which the whole was constantly enfolded into   and   unfolded from each region of an   electromagnetic field, through dynamical movement   and   develop- ment   of   the field according to the laws   of   classical field theory. But now, this whole field   is   no   longer a self-contained totality; it depends crucially   on   the super-quantum potential.   As   we   have seen, however, this in   turn   depends   on   the 'wave function of the universe' in a way that   is   a generalization   of   how the   quantum   potential for particles depends   on   the wave function   of   a system of particles. But all such wave functions are forms   of   the implicate   order   (whether they refer to particles   or   to fields). Thus, the super-quantum potential expresses the activity   of a   new   kind   of   implicate order. This   implicate   order   is immensely more subtle   than   that   of   the original field, as well as more inclusive, in the sense   that   not   only   is   the actual activity   of   the whole field enfolded in it,   but   also all its potentialities, along with the prin- ciples determining which   of   these shall become actual. I was in this way led to call the original field the first implicate order, while the super-quantum potential was called the second im- plicate   order   (or   the super-implicate order).   In   principle,   of   course, there could be a third, fourth, fifth implicate order, going   on   to infinity,

            44   David Bohm  and these would correspond to extensions of the laws of physics going beyond those   of   the current   quantum   theory, in a fundamental way. But for the present I want to consider only the second implicate order, and to emphasize   that   this stands in relationship to the first as a source of formative, organizing   and   creative activity. It should be clear   that   this notion now incorporates   both   of   my earlier perceptions -   the implicate order as a movement of outgoing and incoming waves,   and   of the causal interpretation of the   quantum theory. So, although these two ideas seemed initially very different, they proved   to   be two aspects   of   one more comprehensive notion. This   can   be   described   as   an   overall   implicate   order,   which   may extend   to   an   infinite   number   of   levels   and   which   objectively   and self-actively differentiates   and   organizes itself into independent sub- wholes, while determining how these are interrelated to make up the whole. Moreover, the principles   of   organization of such   an   implicate order can even define a unique explicate order, as a particular   and   distin- guished sub-order, in which all the elements are relatively independent and   externally related.   16   To   put   it differently, the explicate order itself may be   obtainable from   the implicate order as   a special   and   de- terminate sub-order   that   is   contained within it. All   that   has been discussed here opens up the possibility   of   con- sidering the cosmos as   an   unbroken whole through   an   overall im- plicate order.   Of   course, this possibility has been studied thus far in only a preliminary way,   and   a great deal more work   is   required   to clarify   and   extend the notions   that   have been discussed in this paper.

            3 Collective   variables in elementary   quantum   mechanics  Eugene P. Gross   Department   of   Physics, Brandeis University  In   the present article I discuss some features of the use of collective co- ordinates in two systems with a small   number   of degrees   of   freedom. In   both   cases the utility   of   collective coordinates   is   connected with the validity   of   an   adiabatic approximation.   The two examples are pedagogical   in   nature,   but   are   perhaps   appropriate   in   a   volume honoring David Bohm, who has made   major   contributions to the theory of collective coordinates. First, however, I present some per- sonal reminiscences of the days when I was a student of David Bohm. My first recollection   is   of   a seminar given in 1946 by David Bohm, shortly after he arrived in Princeton as   an   assistant professor. The subject was plasma physics. The talk was divided into three parts. The first   part   dealt with the plasma as a distinct state of matter, with an   organization different from the solid, liquid   and   gas. The charge screening   and   lack of velocity locking was emphasized. The second part   had   to   do   with the widespread occurrence of plasmas in discharge tube physics, in astrophysics   and   in chemistry. He touched   on   the connection with microwave space-charge devices. Particular attention was paid to plasma oscillations   and   the frequent occurrence of in- stabilities. The third   part   dealt with metals viewed as   quantum   plas- mas. The main tool of analysis was the linearization of the equations of motion for   products   of creation   and   annihilation   operators   by means of the   random   phase approximation. I was then looking for a thesis advisor.   In   his low key fashion, Dave Bohm   had   opened up a vast panorama.   It   was clear   that   an enormous range of problems   had   to be explored. The intertwining of conceptual   and   practical problems was very appealing   and   exciting. How   lucky to have the possibility of doing a thesis which was much more   than   doing the simple next step in   an   ongoing research program. I worked   hard   on   my notes,   and   wrote   up   the lecture very carefully. I gave them to Dave   and   was taken   on   as a student. We spent a tremendous   amount   of   time together. There are advan- tages to having a bachelor as a mentor. We spent some time   at   the blackboard,   but   mainly talked.   Then   Dave wrote things   down   on paper. But even more vivid in my memory are the very long walks 46

            Collective variables   47  through Princeton, with numerous stops for coffee. Dave developed ideas   and   responded to questions   and   criticisms.   What   was remarkable was   that   one could   do   theoretical physics without a blackboard   and without pencil   and   paper. After returning to the office it seemed that the mathematics just settled into place, with significant results coming quickly. I slowly realized   that   there was a hidden background. Dave had been   an   assistant to   W.   R.   Smythe   and   had done essentially all   of   the difficult problems in   Static and Dynamic Electricity.   He   had   written papers   on   the theory of high energy accelerators   and   on   the velocity distribution of electrons in nebulae. There was several years of total involvement with the behavior   of   plasmas in magnetic fields, in con- nection with his work for the   Manhattan   Project. These papers were written with his characteristic lucidity. The physical descriptions stand out   and   control the mathematical analysis.   All   of   this work was ger- mane to   our   research   on   the classical kinetic theory   of   plasnlas   and beams. There   is   undoubtedly more background   that   I   am   not   aware   of. Dave   was   also   deeply   concerned   with   quantum   problems.   He thought   about   many-electron problems   and   superconductivity. He was at   work   on   his text   on   quantum   theory. He reformulated the theory of   measurement in   quantum   mechanics.   Most   of   all, he was fascinated by Bohr's ideas   on   the role   of   complementarity in describing nature. The problem   of   the divergences in   quantum   electrodynamics was very much   on   people's minds.   Dave worked   on   self-oscillations of finite-sized particles   and   on   Kramer's theory   of   non-relativistic electro- dynamics. His lectures   on   advanced   quantum   mechanics dealt with electrodynamics.   He   gave   much   thought   to   the   hypothesis   of   a minimum length in physics   and   to reconciling relativity   and   quantum mechanics for structures   of   finite extent. Along with other physicists such as Bohr, he felt   that   a really radical change in physical ideas was needed. Instead, Schwinger's program   of   starting with the full Maxwell- Dirac Lagrangian, insisting   on   manifest covariance,   and   quarantining the   divergences,   represented   a   different   kind   of   radical   change. Feynman's introduction   of   diagrams freed the imaginations of theor- etical physicists to deal with what   had   been depressingly complicated formalisms in   quantum   field theory   and   many-body physics. In the light   of   this rich background,   it   is   now less surprising to me that   one could   do   physics by talking. The use of analogy   is   very powerful when there   is   a well-defined mathematical basis for the anal- ogies. Still, I continue to marvel   at   Dave's extraordinary manner   of expressing ideas   and   of   constructing coherent intellectual structures. It   made possible communication with non-physicists, who appreciated Dave's ability to explain the fundamental ideas   of   physics. Indeed, this   sometimes   became ludicrous.   I   recall   a   social evening   where, tongue in cheek, he constructed   an   elaborate   and   'convincing' theory of   the existence of ghosts   and   devils. The reconciliation   of   collective   and   individual aspects of behavior

            48   Eugene   P.   Gross  in many-body theory,   and   of wave   and   particle aspects in   quantum theory, moved to the forefront   of   Dave's thoughts. He was   not   satisfied with the equations-of-motion approach to many-body theory. He felt that   a description was needed   that   dealt with collective   and   individual aspects simultaneously. This led to the successful auxiliary variable theory of Bohm   and   Pines.   1   A beautiful account   of   the ideas   is   found in Dave's later (1956) Les Houches lectures.   2   .  He continued this work with   T.   Staver   and   D. Salt,   and   extended the description in his papers with G. Carmi.   3   The ideas of these later papers have   not   been sufficiently appreciated by physicists. On   the problem of the foundations   of   quantum   theory, his analysis of the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen thought experiment gave rise to his causal reformulations. He continued this work in Brazil, Israel and England. The role   of   non-locality emerged. This culminated in the celebrated   and   startling   Aharonov-Bohm   analysis of electromagnetic potentials in   quantum   theory.   It   now occupies   an   important   position in the physical foundations   of   gauge theories. There   is   another   aspect.   It   was the non-competitive atmosphere in which Dave did his work. I recall   an   incident. In   our   first paper   on plasma oscillations   we   had independently discovered the phenomenon of   Landau   damping. We used   an   orbit-tracing approach   and   con- sidered the low collision frequency limit. It was used to understand particle trapping   and   the limitations   of   the linear theory. I came upon a copy of the   Journal   of   Physics   containing Landau's solution of the linearized Vlasov equation. 4   Due   to wartime dislocations it arrived in Princeton after a delay   of   a year. I rushed to show it to Dave, who was in the shop constructing a frame for a hi-fi set. He was   not   at all perturbed   at   being scooped   and   simply admired   the elegance   and incisiveness of Landau's paper. Broader philosophical questions were often discussed in the numer- ous conversations   that   Dave had with me   and   others. I   had   taken courses in mathematical logic from   A.   Church   and   pressed its claims on   Dave. We talked   about   the relation to dialectical modes of think- ing. I recall a conversation in the graduate student library at Prince- ton.   It   had a copy of the   Catholic Encyclopedia.   We looked at the article   on   the Holy Trinity,   and   noted how similar the language was to   that   of Bohr. However, nothing came   of   an   attempt to generalize Bohr's notion of wave-particle duality. Dave was always concerned with the philosophical problem of obtaining adequate concepts   and modes of thinking to make sense of   our   experience. He has continued this with his explorations of the notions of implicate   and   explicate order. Finally, I can only use old-fashioned language to describe his impact on   me   and   others. Dave's essential being was then,   and   still   is,   totally engaged in the calm   but   passionate search into the nature   of   things. He can only be characterized as a secular saint. He   is   totally free of

Indeed, his students   and   friends, mostly younger   than   he   is,   felt a powerful urge to protect such a precious being.   Perhaps the deep affection of his many friends helped to sustain him in the difficult years of the early 1950s.  1   Atom-molecule   transition  (a)   Introduction  As   the first example of the use of collective coordinates, consider a three-particle system, with two of the particles having the same mass  M   and   the other particle a mass   m.   The Hamiltonian   is:  -p2   -p2   +   -p2 H   = -   +   1   2   +   V(7/   -   7/1)   +   V(7/   -   7/2)   +   U(7/1   -   7/2)  2m   2M  The Hydrogen molecular (two center) ion corresponds to the attractive:  V(r)   =   -e   2   lr  between   an   electron (mass   m)   and   the nuclei (mass   M).  U(r)   =   +e   2   lr  is   the nuclear repulsion,   and   M   ~   m.  The H - ion   is   the atomic (one center) case where   m   is   the mass   of   the proton   and   M   is   the mass of the electrons. The potential energies are the same. This   is   the opposite limit of the same Hamiltonian,   i.e.  M~m.  One can choose one of the masses (say   m)   to set the scale of energy.  h 2  For   example   we   can choose a Bohr radius   aD   =   --2   and   the energy  me  4 unit   :~   . Then the spectrum depends   on   the ratio   m/ M.   It   is inter- esting that there   is   a drastic change in the spectrum as the single parameter   ml   M   is   varied. The diatomic molecule   is   a highly organized system.   5   We have a well-defined structure   of   the atomic, vibrational and   rotational low levels whose energies are in the ratio   1,   tJM   and 1 1M.   In   the atomic limit   m   ~   M,   the H - ion has only a ground state that   is   3/4   eV below the continuum. We would like to understand the concepts   that   are needed to describe this transition of the level struc- ture. Cases where the mass ratio   is   not   so extreme do occur in nature, e.g.   J.l   mesic atoms   and   molecules.   In   nuclear physics there are also three-body problems where all the masses are comparable,   but   the potential energies are different.   We expect the level variation with  ml   M   to be smooth.

            50   Eugene   P.   Gross  To   proceed   we   need a suitable set of new coordinates. Guided by the physics   of   the molecular limit   we   choose:  R   -   mq   +   M(ql   +(2)   ~   (ql   +(2)   j_-   _-  -   m   +   2M   ,1   -   q   2'   .l   -   q   1   q   2 Here   R   is   the center of mass   of   the system as a   whole,   and   is   a collective coordinate. (Frequently a collective coordinate   is   a one-body additive function   of   the original coordinates.)   r   is   a coordinate of the lone particle relative to the center of mass of the nuclei:  ql +q2  2  y   is   the relative coordinate   of   the two nuclei. Introducing the reduced mass   of   the electron: 1   1   1 --=-+-  J1   m   2M  the Hamiltonian takes the form:  H   =   2(m   :i 2M)   +   ~~   +   ~   +   ~~   -   -,   ) +   ~~   +   -,   ) +   Uen  The center   of   mass motion   is   clearly separated,   i.e.   R   is   an ignorable coordmate. This expresses the rigorous translation invariance of the Hamiltonian,   i.e.   that   it   is   unchanged when there   is   a common dis- placement of the original coordinates. In atomic theory, the   standard   coordinates for the discussion of the effects of the finite nuclear mass   on   atomic spectra are: Since   q   is   the coordinate of the heavy particle (mass   m)   and   ql   and  q2   the coordinates of the electrons (mass   H),   it   is   natural to measure the position   of   the light particles (mass   M)   relative to the heavy par- ticle (mass   nl).

This description   is   also satisfactory for the   ml   M   ~   1 atomic limit. The different coordinate choices correspond   to different   pictures that   are used in obtaining   an   understanding of the behavior of the system.

We lose some   important   feature of the actual systems, since the oscillator attraction always holds   the particles together.

The spectrum   is:  E   =   (n x   +   n y   +   n z   +   D~   +   (V x   +   v y   +   V z   +   D  J2~~   +   2~)  where the   I1   x   â¢â¢â¢   ,   v x   â¢â¢â¢   are integers (including zero). Since each of the sub-Hamiltonians   is   rotation   invariant,   we   have alternative descrip- tions   in   terms   of   principal,   angular   momentum   and   azimuthal quantum   numbers. These are   important   in discussing perturbations   of the systems by external electric   and   magnetic fields. In the molecular limit   (M   ~   m)   there is a triply-degenerate high- .   1 frequency branch represented by   v   x '   v   y ,   v   z'   proportIOnal   to   ~   and with a weak dependence   on   m/   M.   The   n   x ,   ny,   n   z   branch   is   proportional to   p   and   is   low frequency. In   the atomic limit   (m   ~   M)   the branches coalesce   and   are de- scribed by the single frequency   ~.  Next, consider the effects   of   the repulsion   U(ql   -   q2)   between the  M   particles. The modes   of   frequency: are unaltered. This   is   the only place   that   the mass   m   enters. These modes are   high   frequency   in   both   the   molecular   and   atomic   limits, with a minimum   at   m   =   21\1. The branches corresponding to   n   x ,   ny,   n   z   in absence of the repulsion are now described by the   rotation   invariant Hamiltonian: An appropriate set   of   quantum   numbers   is   the angular   momentum   / with a (2/   +   1)   azimuthal degeneracy.

A more   precise analysis   of   the   Rv,l   equation   yields a theory   of   the vibra- tion-rotation   interaction.   If   one moves away from the molecular limit to   the transition   region, where   M   and   m   are comparable,   we   get increasing distortion   and   modification   of   the spectrum.

An even better starting point   is the Hartree-Fock independent particle description. However, when Z   is   reduced so   that   one reaches the helium   atom (Z   =   2),   this description   is   not   very good.   One   needs wave functions that, even in the fixed nucleus limit, give a more accurate account of the correlated motion   of   the electrons. It   is   necessary to classify the levels into   para   and   ortho-helium. The Pauli principle requires   that the wave functions are antisymmetric under combined interchange of space   and   spin coordinates of the electrons. The perturbations arising from   the   finite   nuclear   mass   give   differential   shifts   of the   energy levels. By   the time one reaches the H - ion   (Z   =   1)   the independent elec- tron   description   is   completely inadequate. If one does   not   have the extreme situation   ml M   ~   1,   the fact   that   the momenta are coupled leaves   us   with   an   unclear   picture   of the   behavior.   For   the   semi- oscillator   model   the   description   in   terms   of   R,   r,   and   11   coordi- nates appears   to   be   better in the intermediate situation, since   the complications are transferred to the   11   coordinates alone,   i.e.   one has a one-body problem.

            Collective variables   55  and   the adiabatic approximation is exact. In   the actual   Ht   molecular ion the electronic wave function   is governed by a potential   that   is   -   2e 2  when   11   -+   O.   So the   8,(11   -+   0)  tl  are hydrogenic levels for Z   =   2 with a reduced mass   J1,.  On   the   other   hand, for large nuclear separations   we   have a spectrum which   is   1/4 of the   tl   ~   0 spectrum.   So   the   8   v   (tl)   curve   is   slowly varying   and   proportional to   mM   .   The   potential for the nuclear  m+M  wave function also involves   U(tl)   =   e 2   /tl   which   ~oo   as   tl   ~   0   and   to o   as   tl   ~   00.   If   we   fix   the units so   that   m   =   1,   we   see   that   we   lose the minimum as   M   ~   0,   i.e.   in the atomic limit.   In   addition the adiabatic approximation has   broken   down   by the time   M   ""   1. Of   course in the atomic region it is better to proceed by doing the perturbation analysis with the   appropriate   set   of   coordinates. It   is   clear   that   the destruction of the highly organized level structure as   m/ M   decreases occurs in a very non-uniform manner. Even in the extreme molecular limit the large   quantum   number   rotational   and vibrational states merge into the continuum.   As   m/ M   is   reduced, only the lowest states retain identity. They are still satisfactorily described in terms of the collective coordinate. Finally all of these disappear and   one   is   left with the H -   ion.   In   the present problem, where there are only a   few   degrees   of   freedom, all   of   these properties emerge from rather   simple familiar mathematical equations. There   is   nothing really surprising,   but   perhaps   we   obtain   a more explicit understanding of the strengths   and   limitations   of   the use of collective coordinates. A very   important   point   is   that   the failure to satisfy the   boundary   condi- tion   at   tl   =   0 becomes   very serious as   one moves   away from   the domain where the collective coordinate yields a good approximation. We would like to emphasize that, while it may be possible to give a theory of the   ground   state energy valid over the entire   m/ M   range, it is   much more difficult to give   an   account   of   the level structure.  2   Electron   interacting   with   two-lattice   oscillators  (a)   Introduction  As   a second example of the use   of   collective coordinates, consider the Hamiltonian:  p2   p2   +   p2   +   q2   +   q2 H   =   2M   1  -   g(qe   cos   kql   +   qo   sin   kql)   +   e   0   2   e   0   -

Units are chosen so   that   the   common   mass   and   frequency   of   the oscillators as well as   h   are unity. This Hamiltonian comes from the polaron problem in a standing wave description. We single   out   a single pair   of   wave vectors.   By   scaling the coordinate so   that   q   =   kql   and   M   =   (M   1   /k   2 )  we   have a two-parameter dependence   of   the energy levels   on   M   and  g.   In   addition the levels depend   on   the total momentum   of   the system. We would like   to   understand the way the low-lying level structure depends   on   these parameters. We can describe the system in terms   of   a pair of travelling waves by introducing new Hermitian coordinates:  qe   Â±po   +   Pe   Â±qo  qÂ±   =   fi   ,P-   fi  and   creation   and   destruction operators by: It   is   convenient to put: Then: This   is   a more familiar form for a particle-field Hamiltonian.

This   is   the   region   where   collective variables   come   into   play   and   where   a   systematic   strong-coupling expansion   is   possible.  (b)   The   adiabatic   approximation  We discuss the problem using the collective phase   coordinate   cp   but we   do   not   introduce the   constant   of   motion   explicitly. The   idea   of   the   adiabatic   approximation   is   that   when   M   ~   1 one first sets   up   the   equation   for the electronic surfaces,   i.e.:

This analysis leads to (logg)/g2 terms in the analysis energy spectrum. The adiabatic approximation   breaks   down   first for the higher electronic states   and for fast moving particles. In   more general theories   that   introduce collective variables   it   is usually impossible to perform the inverse transformation.   The   regu- larity   conditions   on   the   wave   functions   are   defined   in   terms   of the original variables   and   imply conditions   on   the   wave functions expressed in terms   of   the new collective variable.   In   our   simple model they are the periodicity in   qJ   and   the behavior   at   Q   ==   o.   Any   of   the systematic schemes for working in the collective description uses wave functions   that   are, strictly speaking, inadmissible because they violate the conditions.   It   is   usually impossible to   do   much   about   this.  (c)   Transition   theories  Let us now ask whether one can find   an   analytic theory   that   goes from strong   to   weak coupling, e.g. fixed, variable   g.   From   the point   of view   of   adiabatic theory   we   imagine solving the   Mathieu   equation and   the vibration   equation   for any   g   and   M.   It   is   however clear   that non-adiabatic effects prevent one from going to the weak coupling limit with a single-product wave function.   On   the   other   hand   a simple perturbation   calculation (which   is   easily   made   variational) using all the   adiabatic   states   should   be   adequate.   This   is   of   course   quite complicated. However, one need   not   have all the details of the strong coupling limit. Consider the translation invariant   product   function:  t/Jo(q   -   qJIQ)<I>(O)(Q,qJ)  where   Q   is   a suitable average, defined by a variationally calculation. One   can define   an   orthonormal   set   of   excited states   and   proceed to a complete transition theory. We have   not   worked   out   details,   but   pre- sumably the level scheme will transform smoothly.   The   main reason for the failure   of   Hamiltonian   transition theories for the   polaron   to show a   smooth   transition   is   the failure to use manifestly translation- invariant wave functions. We are using translation-invariant states for the two-oscillators model. On   the   other   hand   it   is   interesting   that   a transition theory for this problem (for the   ground   state) can be made with ideas   that   come from the   M   ~   CfJ   limit. These ideas are intermediate coupling theory or   Bloch-Nordsieck   transformations   and   variants   of a   generalized harmonic approximation. The wave functions are very different from those involved in using extensions   of   strong coupling approaches. Consider the problem of determining the   ground   state energy in the manifestly translation-invariant representation   q~,   q~   that   is   natural   in the weak-coupling   and   fixed-source limit. We dilate the odd-parity oscillator coordinate by introducing:

The   other   terms disagree. The adiabatic theory   is   of course the correct theory for strong coupling. This type   of   extension   of   the weak coupling theory connects to the leading term in strong coupling.   In   a   polaron   theory with a fixed lattice cut-off, one reaches the strong coupling limit with a normal mode transformation   and   a suitable linear shift in the oscillator vari- able. The mechanism is the same,   i.e.   the static shift of modes   of   wave vector   k   goes from 1   +   ~2   12m   at   weak coupling   to   g   for sufficiently large   g   and   wave vector   k   less   than   the fixed cut-off. This means   that the dynamic coupling   of   long wavelength lattice modes to the electron (represented   by   the   normal   mode   transform)   suppresses   the   recoil denominator   of   perturbation   theory.   On   the   other   hand, for given   g, sufficiently short-wave modes couple as in perturbation theory.   In   the polaron   theory without a lattice cut-off, all modes up to a wave vector  k   ""   g2   couple   classically,   i.e.   without   a   recoil   denominator.   This explains why the strong coupling energy for the   polaron   goes as -   g4 rather   than   as -   g2   for the two-mode theory. This type of transition theory for the ground-state energy   is   not very accurate. If the theory   is   extended to a study   of   the entire level scheme, the results are   poor   in the strong coupling domain. Feynman's path   integral calculation   of   the ground-state energy can also be done for the two-mode model.   It   gives more accurate results,   but   it   is   not   a theory of the level structure.   On   the   other   hand   it would be desirable to have a theory   that   gives   an   account   of   the spectrum   on   the transi- tion region. At present only the adiabatic theory, based   on   collective variables, gives the spectrum in the strong coupling region. Within the Hamiltonian scheme, one can probably go to weaker couplings by taking into account the non-adiabatic effects. It would be worthwhile to extend the   path   integral   approach   to a theory   of   the structure   of the low-lying levels.  3   Polaron   problem  We   add   a   few   remarks   on   the use of collective coordinates in the polaron   problem.

In   the weak coupling   or   heavy   source   limit   it   is   useful   to   introduce   the   lost transform.  p'   =   p   -   In(X)Vq>dX, q>'(x)   =   q>(x   -   7/),   n'(x)   =   n(x   -   7/),   7/'   =   7/ This   is   the   analogue   of   the   coordinates   introduced   in   the   atomic   limit and   in the weak coupling limit for the   two-mode   problem. In   the   strong   coupling limit collective   coordinates   can   be   introduced by writing:  <p(x)   =   L   QvXv(x   -   R)  v*   1,2,3 Here   we have   an   orthonormal   set   Xv(x).   Three   of   the   field oscillators are   deleted   and   replaced by the three   R   collective coordinates. These can   be fixed by imagining   that   one   can   solve:  Iq>(X)XiX   -   R)d   3   x   =   0,   rx.   =   1,2,3 for   R(   <p).   The   X   a   are   three (essentially p-wave) functions.   This   is   an idea   due   to   Pekar.   It   makes   possible   a   strong   coupling   adiabatic theory   which   can   be carried   through   without   explicitly solving for  R.   (See the detailed   study   by   the   author.   9 ) However   R   is   not   really   a   good   collective   coordinate   globally. One   sees   this   by   examining   the   elementary   soluble   fixed-source problem   (M   ~   00)   for a field   <p(x).   The   solution   with the   coordinates  Qv   and   R   is   ridiculously   complicated.   Nonetheless   it   gives   a good   strong   coupling   theory   of   the low-lying states when   M   ~   1.  This type   of   theory   can   also be   done   by   introducing   R   as   extra coordinates   and   imposing   three   auxiliary   conditions   on   the   wave function.

            4  The   collective   description   of particle interactions:   from plasmas   to   the   helium   liquids  David Pines   Universi(v   of   Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  Introduction  A plasma, for the physicist,   is   not   a jelly-like substance.   It   is   a gas containing   a   very   high   density   of   electrons   and   ions.   The   name 'plasma' for such a gas was coined by the late Irving Langmuir in the course   of   his theoretical   and   experimental investigations   of   gas dis- charges   at   General Electric Research Laboratories   during   the 1920s. In   a gaseous discharge, such as one finds in a fluorescent light, only a minute fraction   of   the   atoms   present are ionized,   that   is   disassociated into positive ions   and   electrons; none the less a study of the   motion   of the ions   and   electrons shows   that   many   new   and   interesting phenom- ena   can   take place.   In   most   highly-ionized gases, such as one finds in the ionosphere (the layer   of   free ions   and   electrons present   toward   the top   of   our   atmosphere), the   motion   of   the electrons   and   ions   is,   in fact, organized   to   a remarkable extent.   The   organization takes two forms, neither   of   which   is   characteristic   of   ordinary   dilute gases made up   of   neutral atoms. First, a given particle, ion   or   electron, does   not move independently   of   its neighbors. Rather, such a particle   is   always accompanied by a cloud   of   other   particles, which move along with it in such a way as to screen   out   the electric field produced by its charge. Second,   the   electrons   carry   out   long-wavelength,   high-frequency oscillations, which involve the coherent   motion   of many   thousands   of particles. Langmuir's studies   of   the possibilities for organized behavior in such a system led him to believe   that   here was a new state   of   matter - neither solid, liquid   or   gas. He called it plasma. A handful   of   physicists were occupied in studying the behavior   of plasmas in the period before the Second   World   War.   For   the most 66

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   67  part   such investigations could be classified as basic research; in other words, physicists studied plasmas   out   of a sense   of   curiosity as to their   behavior.   During   the   war   the   size   of   that   group   increased somewhat; one   of   the methods   of obtaining separated isotopes   of uranium, the so-called calutron, invented   at   the University of Cali- fornia   at   Berkeley, involved the use   of   highly ionized arc sources,   i.e. plasmas. Also toward the end   of   the war,   and   in the years immediately following it, physicists began to be interested in plasmas as possible devices for the production   and   amplification of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region. Thus in 1950,   at   the time I received my   PhD degree from   Princeton   University under David   Bohm for   a   thesis entitled 'The role of plasma oscillations in electron interactions,' there were likely no more   than   a hundred physicists in this country   and abroad   who were, in one sense   or   another, working   on   plasmas. Some were electrical engineers, working   on   electron vacuum tubes; some were still concerned with gaseous discharges. Others were astrophy- sicists, interested   not   so much in the ionosphere as in the plasma   of charged particles which surround the sun,   or   that   very dilute plasma which makes up all of inter-planetary   and   intergalactic space. Bohm and   I were interested in plasmas for yet   another   reason - as offering a clue to a fundamental understanding of the behavior   of   electrons in metals. Today the number   of   physicists engaged in working   on   plasmas   is in the thousands. There   is   a Plasmas Physics Division   of   the American Physical Society; it boasts some 2,000 members   and   represents only a modest fraction   of   the physicists   and   electrical engineers in the United States   interested   in   such   problems.   This   hundred-fold   growth   in plasma research has been due primarily to the launching of large- scale programs designed to harness the power liberated in the fusion of light   atoms   at   high   temperatures.   Such   attempts   at   controlled thermonuclear fusion involve the use   of   plasmas. At the temperatures at   which a thermonuclear reactor might operate, the matter within would be a plasma; moreover, the screening action of plasmas permits one to envisage the possibility   of   a thermonuclear reactor with its interior   at   millions of degrees centigrade   and   its walls   at   room tem- perature. Interest in plasmas grew, too, because theoretical physicists came to recognize   that   an   idealized   model for   a   plasma   represents   a   par- ticularly simple,   and   often soluble, example   of   a many-body problem. The many-body problem   is   one   of   the problems   of   principal concern to the theoretical physicist today.   It   may be formally defined as   'a study   of   the behavior   of   systems in which the simultaneous presence and   interaction   of   many   particles   markedly   alters   their   isolated individual behavior.' Less formally,   we   could describe it as a study of all condensed systems   and   most gases -   that   is   liquids, solids, plasmas and   not-too-dilute   gases.

            68   David Pines  physicist   is   interested in range from   the behavior   of   metals to the motion   of   nucleons in the nucleus   and   the interior   of   neutron   stars. They comprise the greater   part   of   chemistry, solid-state physics   and nuclear physics. The   theoretical physicist who works   on   a many-body problem such as   the   plasma   would   seem,   at   first   sight,   to   be faced   with   an   in- superable handicap.   How   can   someone who   is   unable to solve pre- cisely any problem involving the interactions between three bodies hope   to   solve   one   involving   millions   of   billions   of   particles?   The theorist's first reaction   is   to   make   a virtue   of   necessity; to hope   and expect   that   just   this feature -   the large   number   of   particles -   will make   life simple again.   In   part   it does, in   that   it makes possible a statistical   description   of   the   average   behavior   of   the   system;   fur- thermore,   the   fluctuations   about   that   average   behavior   are   small. However, the use   of   a statistical description   is   not   in itself enough; the problems   under   consideration are still   too   complicated to be under- stood   in precise mathematical detail. In   any   approach   to understanding the behavior   of   complex systems, the theorist   must   begin by choosing a simple, yet realistic, model for the behavior   of   the system in which he   is   interested.   Two   models are commonly   taken   to   represent the behavior   of   plasmas.   In   the first, the plasma   is   assumed to be a fully ionized gas; in   other   words, as being made   up   of   electrons   and   positive ions   of   a single atomic species.   The model   is   realistic for   experimental   situations   in   which   the   neutral atoms   and   impurity ions, present in all   laboratory   plasmas, play a negligible role.   The   second model   is   still simpler; in it the discrete nature   of   the positive ions   is   neglected altogether.   The   plasma   is   thus regarded as a collection   of   electrons moving in a   background   of   uni- form positive charge. Such a model   can   obviously only teach us   about electronic behavior in plasmas.   It   may be expected to account for experiments conducted   under   circumstances such   that   the electrons do   not   distinguish between the model, in which they interact with the uniform charge,   and   the actual plasma, in which they interact with positive ions. We   adopt   it in   what   follows as a model for the electronic behavior   of   both   classical plasmas   and   the   quantum   plasma formed by electrons in solids. In   this article I shall try   to   put   in historical perspective the key physical ideas   and   mathematical approaches which   David   Bohm   and I   used   in   our   development   of   a   collective   description   of   electron interactions in metals during the period 1948-53. This   work   led   to   the identification   of   quantized plasma oscillations as the   dominant   long- wavelength   mode   of   excitation   of   electrons in most solids.   It   justified the application   of   the independent electron model to the low-frequency motion   of   electrons in metals,   and   made   possible a consistent   and accurate calculation of metallic cohesion. I shall then describe briefly how the extension   of   those ideas   to   systems   of   strongly interacting

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   69  neutral   particles,   the   helium   liquids,   has,   some   thirty   years   later, enabled   us to   understand effective particle interactions, elementary excitations   and   transport   in the helium liquids.   As   a result   we   now possess a unified picture   of   excitations   and   transport   in   both   charged and   neutral strongly-interacting   quantum   many-body systems.  From   classical   to   quantum   plasmas  Consider a classical plasma; one in which the density   and   temperature of the electrons are such   that   their   motion   may be treated according to the laws   of   classical mechanics.   As   we   have mentioned, such   an electron   system   displays   a   high   degree   of   organization,   which   is manifested in   both   its screening action   and   in   the coherent   high- frequency oscillations known as plasma oscillations. Here   we   have   our first glimpse of the quite different electronic behavior resulting from the many-body character of the problem. We begin with a gas   of individual electrons, each   of   which behaves in isolation as a free par- ticle. We bring the electrons together in a uniform background   of positive charge to form the plasma, with, say,   an   average density   of 100 billion electrons per cubic centimeter. We find   that   as a conse- quence the electrons   no   longer behave simply as independent particles; their mutual interaction leads them   to   screen   out   any charge dis- turbance   and   to carry   out   the plasma oscillations. To   understand the screening aspect of the plasma, let us imagine that   we   have established   an   imbalance of charge distribution over some region in its interior. We might try toÂ·   do   this by trying to build an   artificial cage for the electrons   out   of   the uniform positive charge, since the latter has opposite sign to   that   of   the electrons   and   so attracts them. If   we   have   an   equal density   of   electrons   and   positive charge,   we have overall charge neutrality in   our   cage.   Now   we   put   more electrons into the cage, building   up   an   excess   of   negative charge. The electrons then experience a   strong   mutual   repulsion,   due   to   their   Coulomb interaction. Their reaction will be a violent one. The excess electrons resent the artificial cage into which they have been put,   and   lose no time in breaking out. They may accomplish their cage-break with ease, because the energy to finance it comes readily from the strong re- pulsive interaction.   As   a consequence, any imbalance in the overall charge distribution   is   unstable,   and   the electron system will quickly return to the equilibrium state of charge neutrality. What   we   have   been describing   is   the   suppression   of density   or charge fluctuations in the plasma by the   Coulomb   interactions. The Coulomb   interaction   is   remarkable in   that   the suppression   is   so   effi- cient, extending over large distances in such a way   that   even quite long-range density fluctuations are sharply reduced. (In other words, even though   we   construct a very large cage, a slight imbalance in charge   will   not   be   tolerated.)   The   screening action   of the   plasma

            70   David Pines  occurs because   of   the availability of many highly-mobile free electrons, which move so as to cut down   and   screen   out   any strong electric fields within its interior. We have been discussing screening in a macroscopic way; it   is   also present   at   the microscopic level. Any given electron in the plasma may, after all, be regarded as producing   an   imbalance   of   charge in its immediate   neighborhood;   its   field,   therefore,   will   also   be   screened out   by the   motion   of   the   other   particles. We may say   that   the electron thus acts to polarize the plasma; when it moves it   is   accompanied by a polarization cloud   of   other   particles. The polarization cloud alters the motion   of   the electron slightly; most   important   it acts to screen out   its field   at   long distances. The plasma oscillations come   about   in the following way. Let us return to   our   example   of   the charge imbalance over a given region. When the electrons burst forth from their cage, in general too many electrons will leave, so   that   within the cage there   is   now   too   much positive charge for the number of electrons contained within. The cage then becomes a trap, pulling electrons back in to establish charge neutrality.   In   fact,   too   many will come in once more, then go out, back in, etc., corresponding to   an   oscillation in the density   of   electrons about   the   equilibrium position   of   charge neutrality.   In   this fashion a plasma oscillation   is   born. The oscillation   is   a longitudinal oscillation since the electron density changes in the direction   of   motion of the wave. It thus corresponds to a sound wave,   and   does indeed resemble the oscillations observed in a slab of jelly   or   plasma. The frequency of the oscillations   is   nearly constant.   It   is   proportional to the electron charge   and   to the square   root   of the electronic density.   For   our   plasma of 100 billion electrons per cubic centimeter the frequency of plasma oscillation   is   in the microwave range. Thus far we have discussed only the organized aspects of the plasma behavior. These are the aspects which are revealed to us if   we   study the plasma with coarse-grained observational tools, which give us in- formation only   about   what   is   going   on   over long distances. Were these the only instruments   we   had   available   we   might conclude   that   the plasma   is   a liquid rather   than   a gas, since it possesses a stable equili- brium state   about   which it carries   out   organized oscillations. Such would no longer be the case when   we   increase the resolving power of our   microscope   and   study what   is   going   on   at   distances comparable to or   slightly larger   than   the average spacing between the electrons.   For such distances the screening action   of   the plasma is   no   longer perfect; strong electric fields can   and   do   exist. Further, the organized oscillations are no longer possible,   and   one merely observes the   random   effects expected from a gas of individual particles. The plasma is therefore capable   of   displaying   both   organized collective behavior,   brought   about by the forces between the particles,   and   individual particle behavior,   of the kind expected if there were   no   forces between the particles.

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   71 We   have   argued   that   the organized   behavior   of   the   plasma   is   of considerable interest.   What,   however,   makes   the   plasma   a particularly interesting object   of   study   is its schizophrenic behavior;   depending   on the   stimulus,   it   will   display   either   collective   or   individual   particle behavior   of   the   kind   we have discussed.   One   such stimulus is a   probe which transfers   momentum   and   energy   to   the system in a   measurable way.   In   principle we   could   think   of   accomplishing   the   momentum transfer by striking the   plasma   with a   hammer.   In   practice we   might use a   charged   particle as   our   probe.   We   then   ask   what   is   the transfer of   energy which goes with a given   momentum   transfer.   If   we   had   only a gas   of   free,   non-interacting   electrons,   the   energy transfer   would   be proportional   to   the   momentum   transfer   and   to   the   velocity   of   the electron which received   the   impact.   For   a   low-momentum   probe, there- fore, the energy transfer is   correspondingly   low.   The   interaction   be- tween   the   electrons alters the   situation   markedly.   The   energy transfer in the   plasma   will be   proportional   to   the   frequency   of   the   plasma oscillation   and   very nearly   independent   of   the   momentum,   for a small transfer   of   momentum.   The   energy transfer is   much   larger   than   that obtaining   in a gas   of   non-interacting   electrons.   We   see   that   the   character- istic excitation energy is increased   by   the   Coulomb   interactions. Be- cause   many   electrons   are   coupled   together   by the long   range   of   this interaction, as a   group   they   can   take   up   much   more   energy   than   would be possible if they   acted   as individual,   uncoupled   particles. If, now, we continue   to   increase   the   momentum   transfer   associated   with   our probe, we eventually reach a   point   at   which this is   no   longer the case. The   momentum   transfer   to   an   individual particle yields   an   energy transfer which becomes   comparable   with   that   produced   by   the   col- lective   motion   induced   by   the   Coulomb   interaction.   We   have arrived at   the   region for a   transition   from   collective   to   individual particle .   behavior; in such a   transition   region the system will display a   mixture of   individual particle   and   collective   behavior   which will in general be quite difficult   to   describe   in   detail.   When   we consider a   yet higher momentum   transfer, we find   that   the   behavior   is simple once more, for   now   the system displays only individual particle behavior,   and   the effects associated with   the   interaction   between the electrons become unimportant. Actually the   behavior   of   a   plasma   is   still   more   subtle   than   I have indicated.   Not   only   are   there regions in which we   might   say it exhibits primarily wave-like behavior,   or   primarily particle-like behavior,   but within a given regime the   two   forms   of   excitation   are   coupled   together. Thus   there   is   a transfer   of   momentum   and   energy from the   plasma waves   to   those single particles which   move   in such a way as   to   be resonantly   coupled   to   them; we say then. the   plasma   oscillations   are damped.   Moreover, when a single particle   in   the   plasma   moves suf- ficiently rapidly, it will excite a   plasma   wave in the form   of   a wave behind   it, in   much   the   same way   that   a ship leaves a wake which

            72   David Pines  marks its path. At any time, then, waves decay into particles   and particles   excite   waves;   such   processes   continue   until   the   plasma reaches   thermal equilibrium,   at   which   time   there exists   a   balance between the two phenomena. Our   discussion   of   the dual aspects   of   classical plasma behavior has been intended to prepare the way for a description of the develop- ments which   took   place in the theory   of   electron interaction in solids during the decade 1950-60.   As   we mentioned earlier, the plasma serves as a useful prototype for the   other   many-body problems, notably for the motion   of   electrons in solids. This possibility was first recognized by David Bohm   at   Princeton University in the late 1940s. Bohm   had worked   on   gaseous discharges during the war   at   the University of California Radiation Laboratory,   and   came to the conclusion   that   the plasma offered real possibilities for   an   improved understanding   of   the theory of metals. His belief was based   on   the fact   that   in a metal, as in a plasma, one dealt with a high density of nearly-free electrons moving in the field of positive ions.   One   might accordingly hope to describe the metal as a plasma of very high density by replacing the positive ions by a uniform distribution   of   positive charge. There were two apparent   obstacles to the development   of   a theory   of   metals based   on the plasma. The first was   that   the density   of   electrons in a metal   is some ten billion times larger   than   that   found in gas discharges.   As   a result the electrons   can   no longer be described by the laws   of   classical mechanics,   but   must   be   treated   by   a   theory   based   on   quantum mechanics. We call such a plasma a   quantum   plasma. Second, the ions in a gas discharge are free to move, while those in a metal oscillate about   fixed positions in a lattice. Their equilibrium positions form a periodic   array   which defines the crystal structure of the lattice.   As   a result it   is   no   longer clear whether the model in which the influence   of the positive ions   is   replaced by a uniform positive charge will be a realistic model for metallic behavior. Such a simplified model will cer- tainly miss the   important   role   that   the periodicity   of   the ions has upon   the electron motion. The question   is   whether such   an   omission would prove disastrous to the physical predictions   of   the theory.  The   theory   of   metals   circa   1948  We can better appreciate the situation if   we   review the status of the theory of metals as   of   1948, the year I began my thesis research with Bohm. Shortly after the advent of   quantum   mechanics, in the period 1928-31,   a   number   of physicists,   notably   Sommerfeld,   Bloch   and Wilson, developed a theory   of   the   motion   of electrons in metals which had   at   its basis a one-electron model.   In   this model primary attention was paid to the motion   of   a single electron in the periodic field of the ions. The many-body character of the problem was allowed for only in a simple, statistical sense.   Thus   each electron was assumed to move

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   73  quite independently   of   all the   other   electrons,   and   explicit correlations in   the   positions   of the   electrons   brought   about   by   the   Coulomb interaction   were   completely   ignored.   The   one-electron   model   was chosen, then, to emphasize the role played by the periodic potential of the ions in determining the electron motion. The predictions   of   the theory turned   out   to agree well with experiment in a wide variety of instances, including the electrical   and   thermal conductivities, specific heat   and   magnetic properties of metals. Despite the good agreement with experiment, theoretical physicists were   not   completely   happy   with the independent-electron model. First of all, they could   not   understand why it worked so well. Moreover, it did   not   yield a satisfactory result for one of the most basic physical quantities, the binding energy of electrons in the metal.   That   it did not   do   so was scarcely surprising, since the neglect of correlations in the particle positions   meant   that   the electrons, in this description, would have   an   appreciable chance   of   being close together. Such close encounters, in turn,   added   a large positive energy arising from   the Coulomb   repulsion   of   the electrons. The energy so   added   was suf- ficiently large   that   most metals, in this approximation, would   not   be stable,   but   would disintegrate into individual atoms. The stability of metals therefore   had   its origin in the correlations   brought   about   by the   Coulomb   interactions,   and   it was necessary to devise a method for taking these into account. The success   of   the independent-particle model would lead one to suspect   that   these interactions could easilyÂ· be included, since they would   appear   to be only a small   perturbation   on   the motion   of   the electrons. (Otherwise, why would the electrons behave as if so nearly free?)   As   things turned out, however, they could not. The first attempts to calculate correction terms led to answers which   no   longer agreed with experiment for   just   those properties for which the independent- electron model worked so well. Attempts   at   a further improvement in the theory, within the framework of regarding the   mutual   electron interaction as   a small   perturbation,   were even less successful.   The answers thereby obtained were infinite - a strong hint to the theore- tical physicist   that   his formulation   of   the problem was   not   a consistent one. Looking back   on   the situation,   we   might decide   that   we   were   not surprised   at   this   turn   in events. We have already seen   that   in the plasma the   Coulomb   interactions   do   modify the motion of the elec- trons considerably   and   lead to considerable organization in the overall electronic behavior. We should therefore   not   expect   that   a theory of electron motion in metals which virtually ignores these interactions could succeed. We then find that, despite its impressive initial suc- cesses, the independent-electron model does   not   work,   and   for just the reasons which might have led us   not   to   adopt   it in the first place - the interactions between the electrons proved   too   strong.

            74   David Pines  Viewed in this light, the   attempt   to make a plasma theory of metals seems a little less foolish.   In   a sense such a theory   is   complementary to the one-electron theory.   In   the former theory, the interaction be- tween the electrons is viewed as the determining factor for the elec- tronic behavior, while the influence   of   the periodic potential   of   the ion cores   is   regarded as a relatively small effect. In the latter, the situation was simply reversed; the periodic potential of the ions was taken into account, the intereactions being regarded as weak.  The   collective   description   of   electron   interaction   in metals  The plasma theory   of   metals was developed by Bohm   and   the writer during the years 1948-53. Its genesis was the classical plasma,   and   its results may be easily understood in terms   of   the concepts   we   have already introduced for   that   system, plasma oscillation   and   screening. The theory was based   on   our   recognition that,   just   as in the classical case,   the   Coulomb   interaction   between   the   electrons   gave   rise   to plasma oscillations. We felt the oscillations played a decisive role;   our problem was how to construct a theory   of   metals in which their exist- ence was explicitly   recognized.   Because in the conventional   math- ematical formulation the only variables which   appear   are those which describe the   motion   of   single electrons, it was necessary, first, to find the collective variables which described plasma waves, and, second, to devise   a   mathematical   formulation   in   which   both   collective   and individual particle variables appeared. In   other   words,   we   had   first to invent a new language   and   second to find a way to apply   that   language to the problem   at   hand. The clues essential to the development of   our   theory came from two directions: from   an   analysis of the behavior   of   transverse elec- tromagnetic   waves   in   a   quantum   plasma;   and   from   a   direct   ex- amination of the behavior of longitudinal density fluctuations in the quantum   plasma. We found   that   if   we   constructed a description of longitudinal electric waves which was the longitudinal   counterpart   of the conventional treatment   of   the transverse electromagnetic wave,   we could, in a suitable approximation, solve the resulting problem   and obtain a collective mode, the plasma oscillation, which   had   a dis- persion relation (i.e. dependence   of   its frequency   on   the wavelength of the oscillatory mode) which was identical to   that   we   were able to calculate directly from the quantum-mechanical equation of motion for the fluctuations in the plasma density. We arrived in this way   at two independent ways of constructing a collective description of the quantum   plasma: one was   an   explicit construction   of   a combination of particle coordinates which would oscillate collectively; the other was based   on   a formal problem which appeared,   at   first sight, to be

            The collective de.scription   of   particle interactions   75  quite different from   that   with which   we   had started, in   that   there was present   at   the outset a collection   of   waves in interaction with the electrons. The coordinates   of   the wave field were chosen as a vehicle for describing the   quantum   plasma oscillations; the number   of   such coordinates   we   introduced   and   the way in which these interacted with the individual electrons was chosen in such a way as to render the resulting problem soluble. In   both   approaches   we   were able to see that at very long wave- lengths the collective behavior must dominate,   and   that   the major consequence of the long-range   part   of   the Coulomb interaction be- tween the electrons was to give rise to collective modes, the plasma oscillations.   In   both   approaches,   too,   we   could   see   that   at   short wavelengths the system would behave as a collection of individual particles which interacted only weakly. The approach in which wave field coordinates were introduced explicitly was in many ways the more powerful one, in   that   we   could specify quite easily the transition from   collective   to   individual-particle   behavior,   and   determine   ex- plicitly the resulting interaction between the particles once the   part   of the Coulomb interaction responsible for the collective modes   had   been taken into account.   It   possessed the further advantage   that   the col- lective modes (the plasma oscillations)   and   the individual electrons were treated on   an   equal footing; it possessed the disadvantage that it appeared that   we   had   over-described the system by introducing   too many degrees of freedom. We therefore had to devise arguments as to how a set of subsidiary conditions, which related the field coordinates to   the   particle   coordinates,   might   automatically   be   satisfied.   Our inability to come up with a simple mathematical   proof   that   these subsidiary conditions could, in fact,   be satisfied (put   another   way, would   not   cause any difficulties   and   could safely be ignored) delayed our   publication of this formulation by some three years.   It   caused   us to devise several other approaches to the problem (such as a method of self-consistent fields   for   calculating plasma   oscillations   which   I included in my thesis) before   we   had sufficient confidence in   our   physi- cal intuition to write   up   our   results for publication as the third in   our series   of   papers dealing with the description   of   electron interaction. The success   of   the collective description hinged   on   two factors. First of all, the new problem   had   to be easier to solve   than   the old. There was no point in inventing a new 'model' problem for a plasma if it were to be plagued by the same difficulties present in the original one. Second, it was   important   to show   that   the solution   of   the new electron  and   wave field problem was, in fact, equivalent to a solution   of   the original problem   of   interacting electrons only.   Our   expectations for the theory proved, in time, correct in   both   respects. It   was possible, by a series   of   mathematical transformations,   to relate the coordinates which were introduced to describe the wave field to the collective variables developed to describe the plasmons.

            76   David   Pines  Moreover   we   could, within a well-defined method of approximation, decouple completely the plasma waves from the electrons so   that   the long-wavelength   plasmons represented   an   independent well-defined excitation mode   of   the system. The model was thus   an   'independent plasma wave' model, in contrast with the independent electron model discussed above. The introduction   and   isolation   of   the plasma waves served to   redescribe almost completely the long-range   part   of the electron-electron interaction.   What   remained was a screened inter- action with a quite short range, of the order of the average spacing between the electrons. Herein lay the beauty   and   the utility   of   the approach. It explicitly recognized   at   the outset the novel feature introduced by the long range of the Coulomb interaction, the high-frequency plasma waves. Once these were properly accounted for, what was left was comparatively simple to understand   and   treat mathematically; namely a collection of individual electrons interacting via a short-range interaction. Indeed, this was just what was required to   put   the 'one-electron' model of metals   on   a more satisfactory footing. Because of the short range of the effective particle interaction, the mathematical divergences which had haunted previous attempts   at   constructing a consistent treatment of   an   electron interaction were no longer present.   It   was therefore pos- sible to apply perturbation theory to compute the way the interaction between the electrons altered the ground-state energy   of   the system. Such a calculation led directly to a calculation of the cohesive energy of electrons in metals; it was found   that   simple metals were now stable, and   that the binding energies calculated theoretically were in good agreement with those observed experimentally. Next, it was possible to compute the effect of electron interaction on   the motion   of   a single electron.   What   one finds thereby   is   a   quasi- particle;   that   is,   a   particle   whose   motion   resembles   that   of a free electron,   but   differs from it in   that   its various physical properties are somewhat altered as a consequence of the electron-electron interac- tion. A simple physical picture   of   a quasi-particle   is   that   of   an   electron plus its associated screening cloud   of   other particles. The alteration in the electron's physical properties are then to be attributed to the pres- ence   of   that   co-moving   screening   cloud.   Thus,   the   independent plasma-wave model leads directly to   an   independent quasi-particle model. The calculated quasi-particle properties were, for the most part, in good quantitative agreement with experiment.  Plasmons  The plasma theory   of   metals predicted the existence of a quite new effect, the excitation of plasma waves by fast electrons passing through a metal.   In   this process the   quantum   character   of   the plasma waves plays   an   essential role. According to the laws of   quantum   mechanics,

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   77  the energy in a given plasma-wave mode can change only in discrete amounts,   or   quanta.   It   is   therefore convenient to go over from a wave description of the plasma oscillations, in which one thinks of waves with a frequency   v   and   wavelength   A,   to a particle description, in which one specifies the plasma wave mode by the   number   of   quanta present,   of energy,   hv,   and   momentum,   hi )~,   where   h   is   Planck's constant. The basic   quantum   of plasma oscillation   we   shall call a plasmon. Because the frequency   of   the plasma oscillations   is   high, the energy of a plasmon turns   out   to be rather large. It ranges from   about   6 electron volts to   25   electron volts,   and   is   always greater   than   the energy   that the most energetic single electron in the metal possesses.   As   a result, plasma oscillations will   not   be internally excited in metals because no internal electron can transfer to the plasma waves the energy required to excite a single plasmon. Such excitation could, however, occur when a charged   particle which   has energy large compared   to   that   of a plasmon passes through a metal.   In   fact, as Conyers Herring pointed out   to us in the early stages of   our   investigation, the basic experiments which confirmed   our   prediction of the existence   of   plasma oscillations in metals   had   already been carried   out   some years earlier. The relevant experimental   data   had   thus been obtained; all   that   was required was our   interpretation of it in terms of plasmon excitation.  ~he   experiments   had   been carried   out   by two   German   physicists, Ruthemann   and   Lang, in the early 1940s. Their experimental arrange- ment was quite simple. They fired electrons through a thin metallic foil   and   measured   the   energy   of those   electrons   emerging   almost undeflected by the foil. Similar experiments   on   the reflection of elec- trons by metal surfaces   had   been carried   out   some years earlier by the Swedish   physicist,   Rudberg.   The   Ruthemann-Lang   experiment required a careful measurement of the energy of   both   the incident electrons   and   those emerging from the foil, since the incident electrons had   an   initial energy   some   hundred   times   larger   than   the   energy transferred to the   foil.   What   was surprising   about   their experimental results was the sharpness with which the energy transfer to the metallic electrons took place in the case of certain metals, notably aluminum and   beryllium. Thus the characteristic energy-loss spectrum for   Be   and Al   consists of several comparatively narrow lines, in multiples of a basic loss quantum, approximately   19   eV for   Be   and   15   eV for   AI. When   we   attempted, in the simplest possible fashion, to interpret this data   as   plasmon excitation,   we   received   a delightful   surprise.   The energy transfers were   just   those to be expected for plasmon excitation, provided   we   regarded   the outermost,   or   valence, electrons in each metal as free. Such good agreement between experiment   and   the simplest plasma theory was most heartening,   and   yet it was also a little puzzling.

            78   David Pines  shows   that   in this latter class of experiments the outermost electrons cannot   all be regarded as free.   During   the next   few   years, many more such   characteristic-energy-Ioss   experiments   produced   results   that agreed closely with the predictions from this simplest version of   our model, including semi-metals such as   Bi   and   Sb, semiconductors such as   Si   and   Ge,   and   compounds ranging from ZnS to   Si0   2   and   mica. F   or   these   materials,   too,   the   outermost   electrons   could   not   be regarded   at   first sight as making   up   a free-electron plasma. The puzzle is   related to the question   we   raised earlier -   that   of whether   our   re- placement of the periodic potential of the positive ions by a uniform positive charge was a realistic model for metallic behavior.   For   it   is just   the influence   of   the periodic potential which gives rise to the distinction between metals, semiconductors   and   insulators,   and   which further causes the outermost electrons in metals like aluminum   and beryllium to seem far from free. The explanation was provided by Neville   Mott   during the Tenth Solvay Congress in Brussels in 1954.   Mott   pointed   out   that   it does make a difference whether we discuss the electrical conductivity   of   a solid   or   its possible plasma behavior. When   we   talk   about   the elec- trical   conductivity   we   are   asking   a   low-frequency   question   of the electrons;   that   is,   a question in which the field   of   the positive ions, which   gives   rise   to   comparatively   low-frequency   effects,   may   be expected to play   an   important   role.   On   the   other   hand, in discussing electron energy losses,   we   are asking a question   of   the electrons   at   a frequency   of   the   order   of   magnitude   of   the free-electron plasma fre- quency for the outermost electrons. This frequency   is   typically quite high compared   to   the characteristic frequency   associated   with   the influence of the periodic ionic potential   on   the electrons.   As   a result the electrons in responding   at   such a high frequency essentially pay no attention to the fact   that   there   is   a periodic ion field acting. They are moving   too   fast to   feel   the effect of the positive ions, or, to   put   it another   way, they move so fast   that   they   cannot   distinguish between the ions in a periodic   array   and   a uniform positive charge of equal overall density. Mott   argued   that   in aluminum   and   beryllium, in particular, one should expect to find a plasma frequency which   is   high compared to the   characteristic   periodic   potential   frequencies,   so   that   plasma oscillations   at   the free-electron frequency should occur.   As   we   have seen, such   is   indeed the case.   One   may easily extend these consider- ations to other solids.   One   finds   that   plasma oscillations   at   nearly the free-electron plasma frequency should be a quite general property of solids, since the frequencies   that   lead to a distinction between metals, insulators   and   semiconductors are usually all low compared to the plasma frequency. By   1956   both   the   theoretical   arguments   and   the   experimental evidence   for   plasma   oscillations   as   the   dominant   long-wavelength

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   79  mode of excitations in most solids   had   progressed to the point   that   at the Maryland Conference   on   quantum   interactions   of   the free electron I proposed the term 'plasmon'   to   describe the associated   quantum   of elementary   excitation,   and   could   demonstrate   that   characteristic- energy-loss experiments provided information   on   plasmon energies, lifetimes   and   dispersion, as well as the critical wave vector beyond which   plasmons could   no   longer   be   regarded   as   well-defined   ele- mentary   excitations   (an   effect   usually   arising   from   the   decay   of plasmons   into   single-pair   excitations).   In   1957   Robert   Ritchie proposed the existence   of   surface plasmons associated with the waves of charge   bound   at   a   vacuum-solid   interface,   and   subsequent ex- periments provided ample evidence for the existence   of   these excita- tions   as   well.   Indeed,   with   the   increasing   sophistication   of   both electron energy-loss techniques   and   vacuum techniques, plasmons are now often used as a diagnostic tool to study oxidation   and   the elec- tronic structure of new materials. Finally, it should be pointed   out   that,   just   as was the case for the classical plasma, there   is   a continual transfer   of   momentum   and   energy between the plasmons in a solid   and   quasi-particles; as a consequence the plasmons possess a finite lifetime, which depends   on   the quasi- particle spectrum   of   the solid under consideration.   None   the less,   that lifetime   is   sufficiently   long   in   most   solids   that   the   plasmons   are observed,   and   the plasDl0n joins the quasi-particle as a well-defined elementary excitation.  The   random   phase   approximation  The basic approximation which Bohm   and   I made,   both   in   our   studies of the equations   of   motion   of   density fluctuations   and   in   our   collective description of plasma waves plus single particles,   we   called   at   first the plasma approximation. We later changed the name to   random   phase approximation (RPA). The latter name better described what   we   were doing, which was to neglect the couplings between density fluctuations or   plasma   waves   of   different   wavelengths,   because   such   coupling involved the sum over   an   exponential term with randomly varying phases; a sum which would,   on   average, vanish,   and   which was small compared to the terms   of   order, the number of particles,   N,   which   we kept in   our   description.   In   this approximation, which   we   were able to justify rigorously in the limit   of   long wavelengths (where all the diffi- culties with the   perturbation   theory treatment   of   the   Coulomb   inter- action arose), the plasma modes could be decoupled from the indi- vidual electrons; what remained was a system   of   electrons interacting via a short-range interaction, a system which   was   amenable to a per- turbation-theoretic treatment. The   random   phase approximation has subsequently been widely used in many-body problems, ranging from studies   of   oscillations of

The first of its many applications in nuclear physics came in work which my student, Mel Ferentz,   and   I carried   out   on   a derivation of the giant dipole resonance in nuclei from the basic nucleon-nucleon interaction. (Because Ferentz developed   other   interests, only a brief account   of   this work was published, in a 1953 letter to the   Physical Review,   written in collaboration with   Murray   Gell-Mann, who   had suggested to us a useful way   of   going from   oscillations in nuclear matter   to finite nuclei;   our   approach   therefore   had   little impact   on   the nuclear physics community until it was reinvented by G.   E.   Brown and   M.   Bolsterli some seven   years later.)   It   has   proved   so   useful because, like the Hartree   and   Hartree-Fock approximations, it   is   rela- tively straightforward to apply.   More   importantly, it   is   the lowest- order   systematic approximation which enables one to test whether well-defined collective modes might appear; where these   do   appear, they are treated   on   an   equal basis with the single-particle modes. In all versions of the RPA, the collective behavior arises as a result of the influence   of   the average self-consistent field   of   the other particles on   the motion of a given particle. Viewed from this perspective, the RPA can be considered as a   time-dependent mean-field theory.   It appeared in three very different guises in the course of work done during the period   1956-8, a period   of   especially intense theoretical activity   on   the   quantum   plasma.   Murray   Gell-Mann   and   Keith Brueckner used diagrammatic techniques, similar to those employed by Richard   Feynman   in field theory, to carry   out   a calculation of the correlation energy   and   specific heat   that   was exact in the high-density limit, while   John   Hubbard   used a similar   approach   to show how the results   that   Bohm   and   I   had   obtained could be directly derived from perturbation theory,   and   went   on   to develop   an   alternative   approach to the calculation of the correlation energy   at   metallic electron den- sities which yielded results similar to those   we   had   obtained earlier. Although plasma oscillations nowhere appeared in the calculations   of Gell-Mann   and   Brueckner, Keith Brueckner, K. Sawada, N.   Fukuda and   Robert   Brout   subsequently   developed   yet   another   approach, involving a new set of collective modes,   and   then showed   that   the Gell-Mann   and   Brueckner   approach   contained   them   implicitly. Further,   their   calculation   was   equivalent   to   applying   the   random phase approximation for all   momentum   transfers, rather   than   simply the low-momentum transfers for which Bohm   and   I   had   introduced it. The circle was closed when Philippe Nozieres   and   I were able to prove   that   the low-momentum-transfer   part   of the correlation energy calculated using the Bohm-Pines collective description gave results identical   to   those   of Gell-Mann,   Brueckner   and   Hubbard.,   and   to demonstrate   the   way   in   which   the   random   phase   approximation breaks down if one attempts to use it for large-momentum transfers at

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   81 metallic electron densities, a   point   which   had   always been emphasized by   Bohm   and   myself. As Nozieres   and   I subsequently remarked: The   development, frequent   independent   rediscovery,   and   gradual appreciation   of   the   random   phase   approximation   for   the   electron gas   ...   offers a useful object lesson   to   the theoretical   physicist~   it both   illustrates the splendid variety   of   ways   that   can   be developed for saying the same thing,   and   it suggests   the   usefulness   of   learning more   than   one   'language'   of   theoretical physics,   and   of   attempting the reconciliation   of   seemingly different   but   obviously related results.  The   helium   liquids  Liquids   made   up   of   the isotopes   of   helium, helium-3   and   helium-4, are   unique   in   nature.   No   matter   what   the   temperature   to   which they are   cooled   (at   atmospheric   pressure), their liquid form   is   preserved. The   physical origin   of   this   behavior   is the   quantum-mechanical   zero- point   motion   of   the low-mass individual atoms, which   is   so large as to   overcome the physical effects responsible for   the   solidification   of   all other   liquids   at   sufficiently low temperatures.   The   helium liquids are true   quantum   liquids, in   that   one   must   simultaneously   take   into   ac- count   the   strong   interaction   between the individual   atoms   and   the underlying   quantum   statistics which the   atoms   as a whole   must   obey. Thus,   although   the particle   interactions   in 3He   and   4He   are   essentially the   same,   and   although   neutron   and   X-ray   scattering experiments show   that   the microscopic   structure   is   quite   similar, 3He, which obeys Fermi-Dirac   statistics,   and   4He, which obeys Bose-Einstein statistics, behave quite differently   at   temperatures   low   compared   to   the   'quan- tum'   temperatures,   3--4   K,   at   which   the   de   Broglie   wavelength   of a   particle   becomes   comparable   to   the   inter-particle   spacing. Thus   at   2.19 K,   4He   exhibits   a   phase   transition   from   its   'normal' phase   to   a   new   'superfluid'   phase   in   which   its   viscosity   is   essen- tially   unmeasurable,   while   the   corresponding   phase   transition for 3He occurs only   at   temperatures   in the millikelvin range. Soon   after   our   initial   work   on   the   quantum   plasma   (which, because the   electrons   possess   charge   and   obey   Fermi-Dirac   statistics,   is   a charged   Fermi   liquid),   David   Bohm   and   I   sought   to   apply   our   ap- proach   to   understanding   the   spectrum   of   density   fluctuations   in neutral   quantum   liquids.   We   were particularly interested in superfluid 4He, whose   spectrum   Landau   had   shown   would   consist   of   phonons,   a long-wavelength sound-like mode,   and   rotons,   an   excitation found   at wavelengths   comparable   to   the inter-particle spacing. We   ran   into   diffi- culties because we were   not   able   to   devise a way   of   dealing with the short-range,   but   very strong, repulsion between the helium atoms.   In the   random   phase   approximation   the restoring force for   an   oscillation

            82   David Pines  at   a given wavelength   is   the corresponding Fourier transform of the bare particle interaction; for liquid 4He the restoring force, as calcu- lated in the   random   phase approximation,   is   unphysically large. Theoretical   work   during   the   1950s   strongly   suggested   that   the physical origin   of   the restoring force responsible for the elementary excitation in liquid 3He   and   4He was closely tied to   quantum   statistics. Feynman showed how, starting from a ground state described by a condensate   (the   macroscopically-occupied   single-quantum   state   re- sponsible for the superfluid behavior   of   liquid 4He, the existence of which   is   a natural consequence of the Bose-Einstein statistics obeyed by the   4He atoms),   one could   derive   the   phonon-roton   spectrum proposed by Landau, which was then measured directly in neutron- scattering experiments   at   the end of the decade. Landau, in his Fermi liquid theory, showed   that   for very long wavelengths   and   low tempera- tures, a Fermi liquid such as 3He would be expected to possess a   zero- sound   mode (subsequently found experimentally by   John   Wheatly) as a result of restoring forces directly tied to the interaction between quasi-particles. Collective modes in the helium liquids thus appeared to be quite different from the long-wavelength plasma modes, which are   not   sensitive to   quantum   statistics. Because the plasma frequency is   extremely large compared to those   of   the single-particle modes, it is   not influenced by whether the underlying single-particle spectrum is   that   of   a normal metal, a superconductor   or   a high-temperature classical Maxwell-Boltzmann gas of the same density. This picture   of   the helium liquids began to change in 1965, after David   Woods,   in   a   neutron-scattering   experiment,   found   that   in superfluid liquid 4He comparatively high-energy (   ""   8 K) phonons not only displayed essentially no change in energy between   T   =   0   and  T   =   2.19 K   but   remained   a   well-defined   elementary   excitation   of normal liquid 4He, with comparatively little shift in energy, up to temperatures near   4   K.   Hence such excitations did   not   depend for theirÂ· existence   on   the presence   of   a condensate. I therefore concluded in   1965   that   the physical origin   of   the   phonon-roton   excitation in liquid 4He   and   the zero-sound mode in liquid 3He was   not   to   be found in the   quantum   statistics obeyed by the individual atoms, but rather in the strong (and quite similar) particle interaction. I used linear response theory to show how one could describe that restoring force   phenomenologically,   and   hence generalize   the   random   phase approximation for the Bose liquid, 4He, and extend Landau's theory to higher temperatures   and   wavelengths for the Fermi liquid,   3He.   I argued   that   the   restoring forces   responsible for   the   phonon-roton spectrum   of   4He must be very nearly the same as those responsible for zero sound in 3He,   and   suggested   that   it should prove possible to observe zero sound in 3He as a well-defined elementary excitation   at temperatures   and   wavelengths for which Landau's Fermi liquid theory would clearly   not   be applicable. The key to that explanation (and prediction) was the idea that the

            The collective description   of   particle interactions   83  restoring force for the collective modes in   both   helium liquids should be derived from   an   effective phenomenological pseudopotential,   rather than   the   bare-atom   potential which   Bohm   and   I   had   used   in   our application   of   the   random   phase   approximation   to   neutral   quantum liquids. Subsequently, my student, Charles Aldrich,   and   I developed a detailed physical model for the configuration space pseudopotentials responsible for   these collective modes, a   model   in   which   the   very strong, almost hard-core, repulsive   bare-atom   interaction would, as a consequence   of   short-range particle correlation, be replaced in   the liquid by a soft-core repulsion, while the long-range   part   of   the bare- atom   interaction would be essentially unchanged   on   going from the gas   to   the liquid. We calculated in 1974   and   1975 the   phonon-roton spectrum for liquid 4He   and   the expected zero-sound spectrum for 3He.   We   obtained   agreement   with   experiment   for   the   excitation spectrum   of   4He, while   our   predicted detailed dispersion curve for zero   sound   in 3He was confirmed the following year in experiments carried   out   at   the Argonne reactor by   Kurt   Sk6ld, Charles Pelizzari, R.   Kleb   and   G. Ostrowski. Sk6ld   and   his collaborators then went   on to   show that., in accord with my 1965 prediction, the m'easured zero- sound   energy spectrum scarcely changed as the 3He sample was warmed up   from   0.04   K (where the 3He is a well-defined Fermi liquid for which Landau's   theory   is   applicable) to 1.28 K (where the Fermi surface   is   no longer well-defined   and   Landau's   theory does   not   apply). Thus, some twenty-five years after   Bohm   and   I   had   first proposed that   strong particle interaction could, in neutral systems, give rise to a distinct   collective   mode,   analogous   to   the   plasma   oscillation   of   a charged   quantum   liquid   (and   ten years after I   had   defined the circum- stances   under   which this might come about,   and   demonstrated   its applicability   to   liquid 4He), this idea was found   to apply   to   liquid 3He.   It   has, moreover, proved possible to develop a unified theory   of excitations   and   transport   in   both   3He   and   4He based   on   the pseudo- potential which Aldrich   and   I   had   constructed. We may therefore conclude   that   the key to understanding strongly interacting many-body systems, be they plasmas   or   the helium liquids, is   to   take   into   account   at   the outset the very   strong   restoring forces responsible for   the existence   of   well-defined collective modes;   what remains are a collection   of   nearly independent quasi-particles whose effective interactions   can   be described by scattering amplitudes which are related to the restoring forces responsible for the collective modes. We   may   thereby   understand   the   nature   of   the collective modes, the transition from collective behavior   to   single-particle-like behavior   and the interactions between the 'residual' quasi-particles   on   the same basis for   both   classical   and   quantum   plasmas   and   for the   quantum   and semi-classical helium liquids 3He   and   4He.   The   vision which   Bohm and   I shared   of   a unified collective descriptive   of   particle interaction in   both   charged   and   neutral strongly-interacting many-body systems has thus been realized.

            84   David Pines  Afterword  The alert reader may have noticed changes in style   and   level of pre- sentation as the article unfolds. The disparities are   not   accidental.

In   this chapter I   had   hoped to de- scribe for the layman how theoretical physicists actually work, how a unified theory develops   out   of   the interplay between physical concepts and   mathematical calculation between theory   and   experiment,   and between theorist   and   theorist.   I found the task difficult, if   not   im- possible,   and   put   the   book   aside. The second   part   of   the article rep- resents a present-day   attempt   on   my   part   to give the interested reader a sense of recent related developments in the helium liquids   and   is based   in   part   on   an   article,   'Elementary   excitations   in   quantum liquids,'   which   appeared   in   the   November   1981   issue   of   Physics Today.

            5 Reflections   on   the   quantum measurement   paradQx  A.   J.   Leggett   University   of   Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  Abstract  Consideration   of   the   classic   measurement   paradox   of   quantum mechanics   raises   the   question:   What   is   the   relationship   between acceptable theories   of   the physical world   at   different levels?   It   is sug- gested   that   it is similar to the relationship between maps   of   different types   and   that, while theories   at   different levels need   not   be derivable from one another, they must   at   least be mutually consistent in their predictions.   The   relationship   between   quantum   mechanics,   in   its standard   interpretation,   and   classical physics fails this test. Existing attempts to resolve the measurement   paradox   are briefly reviewed, and   it   is   suggested   that   one avenue has been insufficiently explored; namely, the possibility   that   the   complexity   of a physical system may itself be a relevant variable which may introdu;ce new physical prin- ciples. Possible reasons for this lacuna are discussed,   and   it   is   pointed out   that   some   of   the relevant questions are now within the reach of an   experimental test. In   this essay I shall try to defend three claims. The first   is   that   the classic   quantum   measurement paradox, so far from being a non-prob- lem,   is   a sufficiently glaring indication   of   the inadequacy of   quantum mechanics as a total world-view   that   it should motivate us actively to explore the likely direction in which it will break down. The second   is that,   as   a   consequence   of   ingrained   reductionist   prejudices   and perhaps to some extent of sociological factors,   we   may have been looking in precisely the wrong direction. And the third is   that   we   are already   at   the threshold   of   some very significant experiments in what just   might   turn   out   to be the right direction. The third claim   is   one which I have discussed   rather   extensively elsewhere, so I will deal with it here   rather   briefly, without much technical detail. 85

            86   A.   J.   Leggett  Let us remind ourselves briefly what the   quantum   measurement paradox   is   all about. A quantum-mechanical system drawn from   an ensemble in a pure state   is,   according to the axioms as presented in most textbooks, most completely characterized by a wave function   t/f,  which   mayor   may   not   be   an   eigenfunction   of   any particular quantity we   wish to measure   on   it. Suppose it   is   not,   and   that   the quantity in question   is   described by   an   operator   A   with eigenfunctions   qJi   and eigenvalues   a   i.   Then in   the   standard   way   we   write   t/f   as   a   linear combination   of   the   qJi   (the structure   of   the theory guarantees   that   this can always be done): [1] and   the prediction   is   then that, if the measurement in question   is actually performed, the probability   of   obtaining the result   a   i   is   Ic   i   l 2 â¢ Once the result   a   i   has been obtained, the system must be assigned (in the case   of   an   'ideal' measurement) to a new ensemble whose wave function   is   qJi'   However, it   is   not   correct to think   of   the description [1] as implying   that   before the measurement the system was already in some (unknown) one   of   the ensembles whose wave functions are   qJi  (i.e., in technical language,   that   its density matrix corresponded to a 'mixture'   of   the   qJi)'   To   demonstrate the incorrectness of this con- clusion (or rather its incompatibility with the usual interpretation of quantum   mechanics) it   is   sufficient to consider the results   of   a mea- surement   of   some quantity   fj   which fails to commute with   A.   In gen- eral the 'mixture' description will predict a result quite different from that which one would expect   on   the basis of the pure-state wave function of equation [1]. There are,   of   course, a number   of   well-known thought-experiments which illustrate this feature   of   quantum   mechanics,   of   which the best- known   is   probably the classic Young's slits experiment.   In   this case the   operator   A   in effect has eigenvalues corresponding to   passage through one   or   the other of the two slits in the first screen,   and   the quantity   fj   is   the position   of   arrival   at   the detecting screen.   (Or   more precisely the   operator   which evolves into this under the time evolution of the system; see reference   1,   equation [4.4].) Actually,   an   even more spectacular experiment has been carried   out   in real   life   recently using a neutron interferometer.   2   In   this experiment a beam   of   spin-polarized neutrons was split into two beams, well separated from one another in space; the spins   of   the neutrons in one beam were flipped   and   the beams then allowed to recombine.   By   blocking off one beam   at   a time it was possible to examine the properties of the other   at   the point of recombination,   and   in this way it was explicitly established   that   the spin properties   of   the complete ensemble (the recombined beams) were quite different from those   of   the mixture   of   the two sub-ensembles (the separated beams). Since the average flux   of   neutrons was low

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   87 enough   that   the probability   of   two being close   enough   to   affect one another's dynamics was totally negligible, this experiment provides rather   spectacular confirmation   of   the conclusion   that   one should   not think   of   the   neutron   as 'being in'   one   or   other   beam   until it   has actually been measured   to   be so. So, crudely speaking, even in situations where a measurement will reveal a microscopic system   to   have one   of   a set   of   possible values   of a variable,   quantum   mechanics forbids us   to   conclude   that   it actually  had   that   value before the measurement was made. This picture is   no doubt   paradoxical (in the original meaning   of   the term, 'against ex- pectation')   and   might lead us to   guess   that   we will some day   obtain   a more intuitively pleasing description,   but   in itself it   is   not   obviously internally inconsistent,   nor   does it lead in   any   obvious way   to   any discrepancy   with   our   everyday   view   of   the   macroscopic   world   -  provided   that   we are   prepared   to   accept the   notion   of   'measurement' as given from   outside the theory.   Indeed, Bohr,3   and   with greater sophistication Reichenbach,4 were able   to   develop   an   interpretation of   the quantum-mechanical formalism which is consistent within its self-imposed   limits   precisely   by   postulating   a   radically   different ontological status for microscopic entities such as electrons   or   neu- trons   and   the macroscopic   apparatus   which performs the measure- ment.   In   the words   of   a famous   quotation   from Bohr: 'Atomic systems should   not   even be   thought   of   as possessing definite properties in the absence   of   a specific experimental set-up designed   to   measure these properties.'   On   the   other   hand,   Bohr   also maintains   that   in   order   to secure unambiguous   communication   of   our   results, we   must   describe the macroscopic   apparatus   and   its behavior in the language   of   classical physics (in which,   of   course, the   apparatus   must possess definite   prop- erties). Thus, it is the act   of   measurement   that   is   the bridge between the microworld, which does   not   by itself possess definite properties, and   the macroworld,   which does.   Indeed, according   to   most   text- books   it   .is   the act   of   measurement which causes the 'collapse   of   the wave function' from a linear superposition   into   an   eigenstate   of   the measured quantity. Thus, the concept   of   measurement is,   prima facie  at   least,   absolutely   central   to   the   interpretation   of   the   quantum- mechanical formalism. Now, the problem is   not   that   quantum   mechanics itself provides   no criterion for when a measurement has   taken   place.   That   would   not necessarily   matter   if we could find some criterion elsewhere (and, as we   shall see, some alleged resolutions   of   the measurement   paradox   do in effect try to   do   just   this).   The   problem is   that   quantum   mechanics  absolutely forbids   a measurement   to   take place, if by a 'measurement' is   meant   a process which has the features ascribed   to   it in the   standard textbook account. This statement needs some amplification.   The   point is   that, if   we   believe (as   most   physicists   at   least implicitly seem to) that   quantum   mechanics   is   a universal theory, then it applies   not   only

Leggett  to   single   atoms   and   molecules   but   to   arbitrarily   large   and   complex collections   of   them,   and   in   particular   to   the   special collections which we   have   chosen   to   use as   measuring   devices   (photographic   plates, Geiger   counters,   etc.). So,   although   it   is   not   obviously   necessary   to describe   these   objects,   and   their   interaction   with   the   micro   systems whose   properties   are   to   be   measured,   in explicitly   quantum-mech- anical terms, it is   at   any   rate   legitimate   to   do   so. Let us   then   initially (for   the   sake   of   simplicity   of   exposition   only)   assume   that   the   meas- uring   device   starts   in   an   initial   state   which   is   represented   by   a quantum   mechanical   wave function 'Po. As before, we   suppose   that the   property   of   the   microscopic system which is   to   be   measured   is represented by a   quantum-mechanical   operator   A   with eigenfunctions  qJi   and   eigenvalues   a iâ¢   Suppose, first,   that   a   particular   microsystem entering   the   apparatus   is   drawn   from   an   ensemble whose   quantum state   is represented   by   the   wave function   qJi.   Then,   if we   are   to   be able to   read   off the   value   of   ai   from   the   behavior   of   the   macroscopic measuring   device,   the   interaction   between   the   micro   system   and   the device   must   induce   the   latter   to   make   a   transition   into   a   different state, with a wave function we shall label   'Pi.   (It   is possible   that   one (but   no   more   than   one)   of   the   'Pi   is identical   to   'Po, in which case we speak   of   a 'negative-result'   measurement.   This   feature in   no   way   affects the   general   argument.)   Moreover,   the   different states   'Pi   must   be   not only   mutually   orthogonal   but   also distinguishable   by   purely   macro- scopic   measurements   (e.g.   inspection   with   the   naked   eye).   (A   dis- cussion   (considerably   more   sophisticated   than   the   above   one,   cf. below)   of   how   some   common   measuring   devices fulfil this   condition is given in reference 5.) At   the   end   of   the   measurement   process   the 'universe' (system plus   apparatus)   is   in   a   pure   state   X   which (for   an 'ideal'   measurement)   is a   product   of   qJi   and   'Pi'   i.e.: [2J The   properties   of   the   'universe' are,   as   we   have   noted,   macroscopically  different for   the   different values   of   i.   Now,   what   happens   in   the   case that   the microsystem was   drawn   from   an   ensemble whose   quantum state   is the   linear   superposition   [IJ?   Quite   irrespective   of   the   details of   the systems involved, it is a general feature   of   the   quantum-mec- hanical   formalism   that   if,   under   specified   conditions,   an   initial   state  X~o)   evolves   into   a final   state   Xi'   then   a given   superposition   LCiX~O)   will evolve   into   the   corresponding   superposition   of   final states, i.e.   into  LCiXi.   Thus,   from [2J, we have:  (   ~CiqJi)'P 0   ~   ~CiqJi'Pi   ==   ~CiX~~   [3J  l   l   l  The   right-hand   side   of   [3J   is a linear   superposition   of   states   of   the universe possessing   macroscopically different   properties.   If   we   interpret a linear   superposition   at   the   macroscopic   level in   the   same   way   as we

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   89  have learned to   do   at   the microlevel, then the only possible inter- pretation   of   [3]   is   that   the macroscopic state   of   the universe   is   not well-defined   until   some   further,   unspecified,   'measurement'   is   per- formed.   In   other   words, the notion   of   'measurement' has   on   closer inspection dissolved before   our   eyes; there   is   no   magic ingredient in the process   of   interaction   of   a microsystem with a measuring device which could lead   to   the reduction   of   the wave packet postulated in the   standard   textbook discussions   of   the axioms   of   quantum   mech- anics. It   is   necessary to remark   that   the above discussion   of   the   quantum- mechanical description   of   the measurement process is,   of   course, quite naive.   In   the first place, in real life we rarely if ever know enough about   the initial state   of   the   apparatus   to assign to it a single pure quantum-mechanical state,   and   would need in practice to describe it by a density matrix; the final state   of   the universe would therefore also be described by   an   appropriate   density matrix. Secondly, the case where the state   of   the microsystem   is   unchanged by its interaction with the measuring device ('ideal' measurement)   is   the exception   rather than   the rule,   and   the description of the final state may have to be modified to allow for this. Thirdly, the measuring device   is   in practice itself   an   open system which interacts with outside influences such as the vacuum electromagnetic field,   and   the 'universe' which   is   described by the superposition   [3]   (or the   appropriate   density-matrix gener- alization) contains   many   other   such degrees   of   freedom.   These are technical details which   do   not   (at least in the present author's opinion) in any way blunt the force   of   the paradox,   and   will   not   be discussed here.   (For   a conclusive refutation   of   the conjecture   that   taking account of the first feature would resolve the paradox, see reference   6.   The second feature   has   never to   my   knowledge   been exploited   in any alleged resolution. The third, which has,   is   discussed by implication below.) The   quantum   measurement paradox, then, consists in the fact   that an   extrapolation   of   the quantum-mechanical formalism to the scale   of the macro-world leads under certain circumstances to a description, namely equation [3], which   is   prima facie   quite incompatible with the commonsense everyday picture   we   have   of   the world   around   us. In   a nutshell, in   quantum   mechanics events   don't   (or   don't   necessarily) happen, whereas in   our   everyday world-view they certainly do: the Geiger counter does   or   does   not   fire; the photographic plate   is   or   is not   blackened   at   a definite point;   and   so on. So the first question   we might ask ourselves   is:   Why should   we   find this state   of   affairs even surprising, let alone intellectually intolerable?   To   answer this question it   is   necessary   to   make a digression   and   investigate what   we   expect of those conceptions of the world   around   us which   we   are prepared to dignify by the name of scientific 'theories.' The relationship between 'the external world' (however   that   notion

Leggett  may be conceived)   and   what   we   human   beings may say   or   think   about it   is   of   course one   of   the oldest problems in philosophy,   and   the par- ticular sets   of   thoughts which have come to constitute the subject- matter   of the   natural   sciences as we know them   today   have no claim to exemption from the rigorous philosophical questioning to which their less technical   counterparts   are regularly subjected.   7   While most professional scientists, including the present   author,   lack the compe- tence   (and   for   that   matter   the time) to pursue such   an   analysis in detail, it   is   clear   that   their reactions to questions such as the ones raised by the measurement   paradox   will be determined by their (often implicit) perception   of   the basic functions of language in general   and scientific language in particular. So it   is   appropriate   that   I should try to   make   explicit   at   this   point   the prejudices with which I myself ap- proach   this subject.   8  I would suggest   that   a helpful way   of   looking   at   scientific theories is   not   as something totally divorced from the everyday language in which   we   describe   our   experience,   but   as   an   extension   of   its resources; that,   at   least in those aspects   of   language which   we   would normally be happy to call 'factual description,'   we   are trying in some crude sense   to   build for ourselves   and   others   maps   of   the world;   and   that this 'map-making' function   of   language   is   made   much more precise and   explicit in the language developed in   modern   scientific theories. This   no   doubt   sounds   not   only unoriginal   but   naive;   and   indeed, so long as   we   take the concept   of   a   'map'   as equivalent to   that   of   a 'picture,' it   is   a view which has deservedly   and   repeatedly been shot through   with holes by successive generations of philosophers. But let us for a   moment   experiment with the idea   of   taking the   notion   of a 'map,' as such, deadly seriously.   In   that   case it   is   obvious   after a moment's   thought   that   a   map   is   certainly   not   equivalent to a picture. What   kinds   of   maps   do   we   know? There are   Ordnance   Survey (or USGS)   maps;   there   are   the   road   maps   put   out   by   the   motoring organizations;   there   are   maps   prepared for   military   use;   there   are demographic maps;   maps   of   the city subway system;   and   so on.   What do   they have in common?   In   the first place, a negative feature; a   map is   not   a picture   of   anything.   (On   looking   down   from a low-flying plane, one does   not   see   contour   lines twisting   around   the hillsides,   nor   does the red   or   brown with which   Ordnance   Survey maps   mark   the roads designated as   A-   or   B-class by the   UK   Ministry   of   Transport   bear   any relation to the actual color   of   the road.) Indeed, while   many   maps (e.g.   Ordnance   Surveyor   military maps)   do   bear   a metric   or   at   least a topological   correspondence   to   the   objects   they   describe,   even   this feature   is   not   essential;   the   maps   of   the   London   Underground (subway) system displayed in the stations are certainly   not   metrically accurate,   and   (as far as I remember)   maps   of   Charles de Gaulle   airport do   not   show   the complicated topology   of   the connecting tubes in detail.   Why   do   we,   nevertheless, regard these as   adequate   and   useful

Quite simply, because they fulfil the basic function   of   a map, which   is   to convey, in the form   of   a visual   gestalt,   an   amount   of   in- formation adequate to permit   us   to plan whatever activity   we   had   in mind (the ascent   of   a mountain, a car journey to Scotland,   an   airport security operation,   or   whatever it was). Since different kinds of maps have different functions, it   is   not   surprising   that   they have little in common, except for being two-dimensional displays (though in future we   may no   doubt   get used to holographic maps). Mountaineers do not   usually complain because their   map   fails to show the names of roads,   nor   do   London   subway travellers complain that, if you believe the wall maps, all subway lines travel in one   of   only eight directions; both   maps are perfectly adequate for the particular purpose for which they are intended.   It   would be totally ridiculous to complain   that   a map   of one kind   is   somehow inadequate because it   is   not in one-to- one correspondence with a   map   of   a quite different kind. There   is   not and   could   not   be any 'ultimate map.' Now, I would like   to   suggest   that   in many cases, where two different types   of   scientific theory apparently cover the same subject-matter   and are   not   obviously reducible to one   another   (as for example in the case of   statistical mechanics   and   thermodynamics)   we   should view their relationship as resembling   that   of   two different types of   map   of   the same area;   that   is,   they are different because they are trying to answer . different types   of   question,   but   they are   not   therefore mutually in- compatible. I believe   that   this type   of   relationship between theories   at different 'levels' (to use a rather question-begging word)   is   much more common in science generally,   and   even in physics, than one would think if one reads either most physics textbooks   or   most philosophers of science.   For   example, most textbooks of solid-state physics give the impression   9   that   the whole goal   of   the subject   is   to   solve Schrodinger's equation for a collection   of,   say,   10   23   nuclei   and   associated electrons, and   that   any   models   which   we   may   build   at   an   intermediate   or macroscopic   level   (for   example,   the   Drude   model   of   electrons   in metals, the Debye model   of   an   elastic continuum, the Landau-Fermi liquid theory,   and   so on) are rather regrettable props which are in essence attempts   to   cover up   our   inability to   do   this by giving approxi- mately valid solutions to the problem.   Popular   as this way   of   thinking may be among solid-state physicists, I believe   that   it   is   totally mis- taken. In the first place, even if   we   could solve the appropriate Sch- rodinger's equation for   an   arbitrary, specified set   of   boundary condi- tions,   we   should never be able to apply the solution since   we   should in practice never be able to determine these   boundary   conditions with sufficient accuracy. Secondly,   and   far more importantly, what would be the value in having a complete   and   exact solution anyway? We should be rather in the position   of   the ancient Babylonians, who   had (or so it   is   said)   an   elaborate system   of   recipes which enabled them to predict astronomical phenomena with a high degree   of   accuracy,   but

            92   A.   J.   Leggett  without any   unifying principle   or   anything which   we   could call a model. Such a solution would by itself in no way help us   to   predict qualitatively new   phenomena, for   it   would   not   identify for   us   the qualitatively   important   features   of the   physical   situation.   That   is precisely   what   the   intermediate-level   models   of   condensed-state physics are all about; they are   attempts   (and,   to   the extent   that   they survive,   successful   attempts)   to   grasp   the   relevant   features   of the physics   and   to present them in the form of a mental   gestalt.   They are  not   'approximations'   to   the microscopic solution   of   the problem, any more   than   the   London   Transport   subway   map   is   an   'approximation' to a 6-inch   Ordnance   Survey   map   of   the same region. If the relationship between scientific theories,   or   descriptions,   at   differ- ent levels   is   not   one   of   derivability, then does it   make   sense to impose any constraints   at   all   on   one description in relation to the other? Clearly it does. At the very least, we need the constraint   of   consistency;  that   is,   it should   not   be possible   to   derive results from one description which are clearly in contradiction   to   those derived from the other.   It   is, actually,   an   implicit   recognition   of   this   requirement   which   is   re- sponsible for much   of   the   current   output   of   theoretical work in con- densed-matter physics,   though   with the ironical aspect   that   most of the   authors   of this work are   under   the impression   that   they are doing something quite different.   Take, for example, the case of a clearly macroscopic law   of   physics such as   Ohm's   law. There   must   be literally hundreds   of   papers in the literature which aim (or claim to aim) to 'derive'   Ohm's   law from microscopic considerations. Yet, if the word 'derivation'   is   taken   literally (in the sense, say, in which it would be understood by a pure mathematician) they all fail utterly. They can claim success,   to   one degree   or   another, only if by 'derivation'   is   meant a procedure which   is   familiar   to   all working physicists but,   oddly enough, little studied by philosophers   of   science, in which what one actually does   is   to   show   that   there exists a series   of   not   implausible auxiliary   assumptions   which,   when   added   to   the   microscopic   de- scription, will   make   it explicitly compatible with the required mac- roscopic   result.   (In   the   case   of a   'derivation'   of   Ohm's   law,   such assumptions might for example relate to the cancellation   of   off-dia- gonal elements   of   the density matrix, to the irrelevance   of   the exact shape of the sample,   and   so on.)   In   other   words,   what   this kind of work   is   really seeking to   demonstrate   is   not   derivability   but   com- patibility   of the models used   at   the microscopic   and   macroscopic (or intermediate) levels. Indeed, it   is   to my   mind   no   accident   that   some of the most   important   theorems in the history of physics have actually been incompatibility theorems, e.g. the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem on   the inexplicability   of   atomic diamagnetism within the framework of classical statistical mechanics,   or   the famous theorem of Bell   on   the incompatibility   of   the predictions   of   so-called local hidden-variable theories with those of   quantum   mechanics.

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   93  After this rather lengthy digression, let us return to   our   original subject, the   quantum   measurement paradox. Viewed in the light of the   above   remarks,   the   paradox   resides   not   in   the   fact   that   the quantum   and   classical descriptions   of   the state   of   the macroscopic world are   not   derivable   one from the other,   but   in the fact   that   they are,   prima facie, incompatible.   To   put it crudely, in appropriate circum- stances   quantum   mechanics   not   only fails to assert   that   macroscopic events (clicking   of   a counter, etc.) occur,   but   positively asserts   that they   don't   occur; whereas   our   ordinary everyday language, which   we naturally think   of   as embodying   our   direct experience, asserts with equal firmness   that   they do.   It   is   as if   we   had two maps   of   quite different   type   but   both   guaranteed   by   their   makers   to   represent topological features accurately, in one   of   which a certain road crosses a certain river while in the other the two never get close together. In that case   we   would certainly say   that   one   of   the two maps must be a bad   one. Yet already there   is   a difficulty with the analogy. In the case of   the maps,   we   could   prove   that   one   map   (at least) was a   bad   one, because under suitable circumstances it would lead   us   demonstrably to mis-plan   our   route;   that   is,   its badness would have practical conse- quences.   What   makes the   quantum   measurement paradox, by con- trast, so uniquely elusive   is   that, as   we   shall see below, in a certain sense it appears to have no   observable   consequences. It   is   no   doubt precisely   this   feature   which   allows   most   professional   physicists   to dismiss it from their consciousness. It   is   now over fifty years since the   quantum   measurement paradox first made its appearance recognizably in the literature   10,   and   in the intervening half-century numerous 'solutions' have been discovered and   (much   more   frequently!)   rediscovered.   We   may   classify   these attempts into two   broad   groups, which are distinguished by whether or   not   they accept the formal validity of the extrapolation of   quantum mechanics to systems   of   arbitrary size, complexity, etc., including if necessary the   human   brain.   In   the category which in effect refuses to do so, the best-known 'solution'   is   probably the Copenhagen inter- pretation as formulated by Bohr, and, with some differences, Heis- enberg; this in effect lays down by fiat   that   the macroscopic world, including   our   preparation devices, measuring instruments, etc.,   must  be described in classical terms,   on   the   grounds   that   otherwise   we should have no possibility   of   communicating with one another. While this   is   no   doubt   a strong argument, the Copenhagen interpretation as such totally evades the real   question,   which   is   how   the   quantum- mechanical description   at   a microscopic level becomes converted into a classical one   at   the macroscopic level, even (presumably) in cases of the type described above, where a literal extrapolation of the   quantum mechanical formation would lead to a quite non-classical account of the macroscopic world.   It   seems to the present   author   that   in so far as this question   is   addressed   at   all in the writings   of   Bohr   and   Heis-

            94   A.   J.   Leggett  enberg, it   is   answered only by implicitly assuming   that   there really   is a   qualitative   distinction   between the   microscopic   and   macroscopic levels   of   reality,   and   in particular   that   there comes some point   on   the apparent   continuum where one   can   say   that   the quantum-mechanical description simply stops (in effect, when one can apply the   standard textbook   'measurement   axioms').   But,   as   numerous   detailed   ex- aminations of specific measurement procedures have made clear (see for example references   5,   11,   12),   and   as   we   discussed earlier, the physics involved in 'measurement'   is   no   different from any   other   kind of physics,   and   there seems no point   at   which it   is   natural to invoke the   violent   discontinuity   of   description   which   the   Copenhagen interpretation would seem to require;   nor   is   it helpful (though it   is   no doubt   true) to remark   that   in most real-life situations it will   not   matter  where   the 'cut' is introduced, so long as it occurs somewhere. It   is   the very   legitimacy   of the cut,   not   its precise position,   that   is   at   issue. A much more radical   approach   to the measurement problem   is   the 'mentalistic' solution espoused by Wigner   13   and   some other physicists, which   holds   that   the   quantum-mechanical   description   should   be applied right up to the macroscopic level   and   that   the occurrence of specific   macroscopic events   is   a   consequence   of   an   interaction   of human   consciousness with the physical world which   cannot   be ex- plained within the framework of the laws of physics itself. (This view should   be   sharply   distinguished   from   a   version   of the   'statistical' interpretation   (see   below)   in   which   the   quantum-mechanical   state vector   is   a description   not   of the physical world itself   but   of   our   in- formation concerning it,   and   therefore changes discontinuously when we   acquire   new   information.   In   this   latter   approach   there   is   no question of a   causal   interaction between 'consciousness'   and   the physic- al world.) In the absence   of   further amplification of this idea,   and   in particular of specific experimental predictions, it seems rather difficult to comment meaningfully   on   it, except perhaps to remark   that   the very meaning of 'consciousness'   is   itself the subject of furious con- troversy   among   philosophers, psychologists   and   others,   and   that   it may   be somewhat dangerous   to   'explain' something one does   not understand very well by invoking something one does   not   understand at   all! There   is,   however, a more conservative way of trying to involve the phenomenon of consciousness in the problem; namely, by speculating that, while it should be possible in principle (even if   not   very useful) to describe the physical environment associated with the phenomenon (e.g.   the   human   brain)   without   bringing in   any   extra-physical   in- gredient, the laws   of   physics themselves might have to be substantially modified when one deals with systems with the incredibly high degree of complexity   and   organization which   is   necessary to sustain even   life, let alone consciousness.   In   particular, one might speculate   that   the basic principles of   quantum   mechanics,   and   in particular the principle

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   95  of   superposition, might break down for such highly organized systems. This hypothesis   is   actually a special case   of   a more general possibility which   I   return   to   below,   so   I   will   defer   discussion   of   it   for   the moment. Let me now   turn   to those 'solutions'   of   the   quantum   measurement problem   which   accept   the   universal   applicability   of   the   quantum formalism. The most conservative   of   these   is   probably the so-called 'statistical'   interpretation   (for   example   reference   14)   according   to which the formalism   is   merely a description   of   our   information   about the system in question,   or   more precisely   about   the ensemble from which it   is   drawn,   and   says nothing   about   the actual state of any particular object, even   at   the macroscopic level. In this interpretation the description [3]   of   the final state   of   the 'universe' after a meas- urement has been made merely gives us statistical information   about the distribution of results obtained in a long series of trials   using identical   pieces   of   apparatus   and   identical   initial   conditions,   and nothing more;   the question   'In   what macroscopic state   is   this particular apparatus   on   this particular occasion?'   is   one which simply does   not lie   within   the   competence   of   quantum   mechanics   to   answer.   The formalism   is   simply a calculus for predicting, from given macroscopic initial conditions, the probability   of   various macroscopic outcomes. This interpretation, while no   doubt   internally self-consistent, has the very   unpleasant   feature   that   under   certain conditions   it   makes   it impossible,   even   in   principle,   to   give   a   quantum-mechanical   de- scription   of   the state   of   a particular macroscopic object; since the theory   is   claimed to be the most fundamental description   of   the world which   we   now have and, according to many physicists, which   we   are ever likely to get, this seems rather a high price to pay. If the   statistical interpretation   is   the   most   modest   of the   inter- pretations of   quantum   mechanics as a universal formalism, the most ambitious   is   surely the Everett-Wheeler   15   'relative state' interpretation (often known, since its popularization by de Witt   16,   as the 'many- worlds' interpretation). This interpretation in effect takes a number   of simple   and   unexceptionable theorems of the formal   quantum   theory of measurement (e.g. the theorem   that   if,   under suitably 'ideal' con- ditions, the same microscopic quantity   is   measured successively by two different macroscopic instruments, the probability of getting two different results   is   zero)   and   superposes   on   them a novel metaphysical superstructure. The wave function, it   is   claimed, describes particular macroscopic   objects,   not   ensembles,   and   is   never   "reduced'   by   a measurement, even   at   the level   of   human   consciousness; thus the uni- verse   is   never "really' in a particular macroscopic state   at   all but   is forever in a linear superposition   of   macroscopically different states. The apparent violent contradiction with   our   'commonsense' view   of the macroscopic world   is   argued away by claiming that, because of the formal theorems mentioned above   ..   we   would never know of the

            96   A.   J.   Leggett  existence   of   the branches   of   the wave function which correspond to outcomes we have   not   observed,   and   that   all physically observable phenomena   would be the same as if the measurement   had   reduced the wave function. The problem   that   bothers critics of the Everett- Wheeler interpretation   is   not   (contrary to what many advocates   of this interpretation seem to believe)   that   they are unaware   or   dubious of   the formal   theorems   on   which it relies,   but   that   they see, quite literally,   no   meaning in the metaphysical superstructure; in the words of Ballentine   17,   'Rather   than   deny   that   a state vector   can   be a com- plete model   of   the real world, Everett   and   de   Witt   choose to redefine the real world so   that   a state vector (like [3J)   can   be a model   of   it.'   In particular, the Everett-Wheeler interpretation seems totally unable to give   an   account   of   my subjective consciousness,   on   any particular occasion,   of   observing a   particular outcome;   to   say   that   this con- sciousness   is   fallacious,   even if a   meaning   can   be   attached   to   the words,   is   not   an   explanation! The   line   of   approach   to the   quantum   measurement problem which is   probably most favored by the majority   of   working physicists,   and which I will therefore from now   on   refer   to   as the   'orthodox'   resolution of   the problem, goes roughly as follows. Let us agree   that   the tech- nically correct description   of   the   state   of   the   universe following   a measurement   is   a linear superposition of the form of   equation   [3J,   or something similar. Nevertheless, it   is   argued, it will be impossible in real life   to   distinguish between the experimental predictions   made   by equation   [3J (supplemented,   of   course, by the   standard   measurement axioms)   and   those   made   by a classical 'mixture' description, in which the universe   is   simply assigned a probability:  Pi   =   Ic   i   l 2 of being in the macroscopic state   X~~Â·   In   more technical language, it   is claimed   that   the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix in a re- presentation   corresponding   to   the   macroscopically   distinguishable states   i   are unobservable in any realistic experiment,   and   that   therefore the technically correct density matrix, which has elements: may   be   safely   replaced   by   the   one   corresponding   to   the   mixture, namely:  Pij   =   Ic   i   l 2   6ij  A variant of this approach, which   is   more   or   less equivalent,   is   to point   out   that   realistic measurements are never carried   out   on   'the universe'   as   a   whole,   but   only   on   some   finite   part   of it   (e.g.   the macroscopic   measuring apparatus),   and   that   after any   appreciable time any macroscopic system will have interacted sufficiently with its environment   that   by itself it   is   no   longer characterized by a pure state;

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   97  in fact, the   reduced   density matrix corresponding to the system by itself will indeed be of the 'mixture' form   Ic   i   I 2   <5   i   i"   In   either version, the argument   then   goes   on   to   claim   that   since   the   correct   quantum mechanical description is equivalent (or equivalent for all practical purposes)   to   a classical mixture description, there   is   no   conceptual problem in interpreting it,   and   in particular   no   paradox   in the fact that   we   observe, in any given experiment, a definite result; this   is   no more puzzling, it   is   claimed,   than   the fact   that   we   have to describe a die which has been   thrown   but   not   inspected in terms   of   probabilities, despite the fact   that   we   know   very well   that   it must in fact be in a definite state which inspection will reveal. This 'solution' to the   quantum   measurement   paradox   (which seems to be rediscovered,   and   re-published, in some variant   or   other   about once a year   on   average) seems to the present   author,   and   many   others, to be   no   solution   at   all.   To   be sure, if its only   point   is   to reassure the working physicist   that   in interpreting his experiments he   may   apply the   standard   measurement axioms   at   any time after the macroscopic apparatus   has   been   triggered,   without   the   risk   of error,   then   the argument   is   unexceptionable. But as a solution   of   the   conceptual   prob- lem it   is   a non-starter; if   taken   seriously, it confuses the (usually jus- tified)   assertion   that   the   correct   quantum   mechanical   description (supplemented,   of   course, by the measurement axioms) will give the same   experimental predictions   as a classical description in which the system   is   in a definite state,   but   our   information   is   such   that   we   can only talk in terms   of   probabilities, with the assertion   that   the macro- scopic system actually   is   in a definite state.   The   latter statement   is in   transparent   violation   of   the   interpretation   of   the   quantum   for- malism as applied   at   the microscopic level, so unless one   is   prepared either to modify the interpretation discontinuously somewhere   on   the way from the microworld to the macroworld,   or   to embrace the full- blooded 'statistical' interpretation (see above),   the   argument   seems internally inconsistent.   In   fact, it only looks plausible   at   all because of a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of the density-matrix formalism (see the discussion in   d'Espagnat   18,   section 7.2).   To   repeat: the conceptual (as distinct from the practical) problem   is   not   whether at   the macroscopic level the universe (or the macroscopic   apparatus) behaves   as   if   it were in a definite macroscopic state,   but   whether it   is  in such a state. Must   we,   then,   resign   ourselves   to   forever   living   with   a   violent conceptual   paradox   in   our   most successful,   and   most cherished, theory of the physical world?   Not   necessarily. There   is   one possible chink in the reasoning which leads to the   paradox   which   is   so obvious   that   it is   really   rather   surprising   that   in the debates of the last fifty years   or so   it   has   attracted   so   little   attention.   It   is   quite   simply   that   the assumption   that   the laws of   quantum   mechanics apply to macroscopic, complex   and   possibly highly-organized systems of matter, in the same

            98   A.   J.   Leggett  way as they   do   to microscopic objects such as elections   and   atoms,   is just   that:   an   assumption,   for which   at   the time   of   writing there   is   no direct   and   little circumstantial evidence. Perhaps the easiest way to see this   is   to note   that   the only time   that   the average physicist ever needs to write down a wave function   of   the type [3]   is   precisely when he   is   discussing the   quantum   measurement paradox; in his ordinary working   life,   be he a theorist   or   an   experimentalist, he never needs to deal   with   superpositions   of macroscopically different   states   19,   and hence never produces any evidence either for   or   against their existence. In other words,   there is simply no convincing evidence that macroscopic superpositions   of   the   type   [3]   exist   in   nature.   It   is   therefore   quite conceivable   that   at   the level   of   complex,   macroscopic   objects   the quantum   mechanical superposition principle simply fails   to   give a correct account   of   the behavior   of   the system.   One   alternative possi- bility, for example,   is   that   as more   and   more particles are involved in the linear superposition it gradually   and   continuously evolves into one   or   other   of   its branches, the probability   of   its ending up in a particular branch being determined by random factors in such a way that   in   an   ensemble of experiments the statistical predictions of the quantum   measurement axioms are verified. However, once one decides that   the formalism   is   not   sacrosanct, there are clearly many other schemes which could be considered, any   of   which would preserve the predictions of the   quantum   formalism   at   the microlevel while allowing the occurrence   of   definite events   at   the macrolevel.   It   is   needless to add   that any concrete proposal   of   this type would require us to intro- duce   new   physical laws   which   are   not   contained   in   the   quantum formalism itself   and   which, while important at the macrolevel, would presumably have negligible effect   at   the level of one-, two-   or   few- particle systems.   For   some suggestions as to a possible definition of the property which discriminates cases in which these laws would be important   or   unimportant, see reference   1,   section   3. Why are physicists as a community so reluctant to consider even the possibility of such a solution to the   quantum   measurement para- dox? I believe   that   the answer   is   to be sought   on   a number of different levels. At the most technical level, there seems to be a widespread belief that all solutions of this type have already been refuted by theory or   experiment   or   both. This   is   quite simply a misconception.   As   re- gards   theory,   the   only   theoretical   consideration   which   would   in- validate such   a proposal   is   simply the demand   that   the   quantum formalism should apply universally, which merely begs the question; theorems   of   the von   Neumann   type   20,   which in effect simply state that the notion of objective properties cannot be incorporated   Â»,ithin  the   quantum   formalism, are clearly irrelevant in this context.   As   re- gards experiment, the often-repeated claim   that   experiment has shown beyond   reasonable   doubt   that   'quantum   mechanics   works   at   the macroscopic level' (or 'applies to macroscopic systems') embodies a

            Reflections on the quantum measurement paradox   99  fundamental confusion. I have discussed this point in considerable detail in reference   1,   and   will merely summarize the conclusion here. Even   the   most   spectacular of the   so-called   'macroscopic   quantum phenomena' (Josephson effect, flux quantization, etc.) in themselves give   no   evidence   at   all for the existence   of   the states of the general form [3J which are necessary to establish the   quantum   measurement paradox,   nor   does the detailed agreement (such as it is) between the quantum-mechanically   calculated   and   the   observed   properties   of macroscopic systems (binding energies, excitation spectra, etc.) yield any more evidence in this direction.   In   the technical language intro- duced in reference   1,   all these phenomena can be,   and   routinely are, explained in terms   of   the properties of states with 'disconnectivity' of the   order   of   1,   2,   or   at   most   a   few,   while the   state described   by equation   [3J   has   typically   a   disconnectivity   of   order   10   23   .   There simply   is   no direct experimental evidence,   at   the time of writing,   that such states actually exist. A second reason for reluctance to consider the possibility outlined above lies   at   a more philosophical level. With   few   exceptions (who include David Bohm   21),   scientists of the last 300 years   or   so have been deeply committed to a form   of reductionism which holds, in effect,   that   the behavior   of   a complex system of   matter   must be simply the sum   of   the behavior   of   its constituent parts. Whether it   is   actually profitable to   describe   it in these terms   is,   of   course, a different question, and   it seems to me   that   it would be perfectly consistent to subscribe to this kind   of   'weak' reductionism while nevertheless accepting the validity   and   desirability   of   higher-level descriptions; in terms of the map-making analogy developed above, this would be like claiming that   it would in principle be possible to make a perfect   and   complete map   which   would describe in   minute detail every last   topological feature,   but   that   there   is   no   practical purpose for which it would be useful to   do   so.   What   is   essential to 'weak' reductionism in the sense referred   to   is   the assumption   that   the experimental   behavior of a complex system such as a solid, a biological organism   or   the   human brain could 'in principle' be completely predicted if one knew the laws which describe the behavior   of   the individual atoms (or nucleons,   or quarks   ...   ) which compose it   and   also the relevant initial conditions on   the equations. (Whether one could in practice ever know all these things   is,   again,   a   different   question.)   What   is   excluded   by   this assumption   is   the possibility   that   there are new physical laws which appear   only   at   the level of complex systems, so   that   the result of a solution of (let us say) Schr6dinger's equation for the   10   23   -odd elec- trons   and   nuclei composing a small biological organism might give results which are   not   only practically useless   but   are actually   wrong.  To   put   it   another   way, such a prejudice excludes   a priori   the possibility that   complexity   is   itself a relevant variable which may require the laws of physics to be modified   or   generalized, in the same way as high

            100   A.   J.   Leggett  velocities   require   relativity   theory   and   small   distances   (or   high energies) require   quantum   mechanics. As   a   matter   of   history, the reductionist prejudice has of course   had spectacular success. The behavior   of   gases has been analyzed in terms of the constituent molecules,   that   of molecules in terms   of   atoms,   that of   atoms in terms   of   the nucleons   and   electrons composing them,   that of   nucleons in terms   of   quarks,   and   so on. Certainly, there   is   no par- ticular reason to believe   that   there   is   any special new ingredient which has to be added to   quantum   theory   at   the level   of   small   or   even large molecules which is   not   already present   at   the lower levels; if anything, the often spectacular agreement between theory   and   experiment leads to the opposite conclusion. Moreover, while the situation regarding bulk systems of condensed   matter   is   inevitably less clearcut (in   that totally rigorous   and   exact calculations in terms   of   the microscopic constituents are   not   usually available, even with the power   of   today's computers) there seems no strong reason to believe that,   as regards the   one-   and two-particle   correlations   which   are   essentially   all   (or nearly all)   that   experiment usually measures, a quantum-mechanical calculation based   on   Schrodinger's equation as applied to the constitu- ent electrons   and   nuclei will give misleading results.   (As discussed above, it   is   quite a different question whether the results will be   useful.)  However, this situation   is   not   one which we should regard as totally obvious   a priori;   a scientist from Mars, unconditioned by 300 years of reductionist science, might well find it a   rather   remarkable feature of our   current understanding of the world.   In   any case, the fact   that   the reductionist assumption does apparently hold   (or   at   any rate does   not obviously fail) for the   rather   coarse features   of   the   quantum   formalism which are reflected in the calculation of one-   and   two-particle cor- relations   is   no evidence   at   all   that   it will continue to hold for the much more subtle features of the formalism which lead to the meas- urement paradox; as discussed in detail in reference   1,   failure   at   a certain level   of   ,disconnectivity' would preserve all the well-established existing agreements between theory   and   experiment while removing the paradox. The prejudice   that   no   such failure will occur   is   no   doubt the simplest   and   (were it   not   for the measurement paradox) the most elegant assumption,   but   we   have   no   a priori   guarantee   that   nature will continue to entertain us with simple behavior as she has seemed to   do   in the past! Finally, it may   not   be totally fanciful to seek   part   of the explanation at   what   we   might call the sociological   or   political level. It   is   commonly believed   that   the 'fundamental' areas   of   research in physics are ele- mentary-particle physics   and   cosmology,   and   that   all   other   areas, in particular the physics of condensed matter, are 'derivative.' Clearly the prevalence   of   this belief,   not   merely   among   the physics community itself   but   among   the general public,   is   extremely useful to those who seek hundreds of millions of dollars   or   pounds   of   public money to

            Reflections on the quantum measurement   paradox   101  build the next   round   of   high-energy accelerators, since it enables them to argue   not   only   that   particle physics   and   cosmology are 'funda- mental' areas   of   scientific research (which they unarguably are)   but that   they are the   only   such fundamental area,   and   that   advances in other   areas   of   science (or   at   any rate   other   areas   of   physics) will   not qualitatively change   our   world-view in the way   that   may come   out   of investment in these areas. Were it to become seriously envisaged   that the physics   of   complex   matter   need   not   be, in all respects, reducible to that   of   its constituent parts, this   argument   might perhaps be examined a little more sceptically; one might begin to ask, in fact, for the actual evidence   that   pushing back the frontiers   of   physics in the direction of the very small   or   the very large will in the   end   change   our   basic understanding   of   the world in a way more fundamental   than   an   equi- valent thrust in the direction   of   the very complex. Apart   from the three reasons mentioned above, there   is,   I believe, a fourth reason why   many   physicists, while admitting the possibility in principle   of   a solution to the measurement   paradox   of   the type en- visaged, regard the question as   not   particularly interesting; namely, they believe   that   the question   of   the existence   of   such a solution   is   in principle   not   accessible to experimental resolution. At first sight some of   the remarks made above would seem to lead precisely to this con- clusion, since, as I have pointed out, the average experimentalist   or theorist, in his everyday work, never comes within a mile   of   a wave function   of   the 'dangerous' type,   i.e.   equation   [3J.   In   fact, merely by accepting what I have called the   'orthodox'   resolution   of   the meas- urement   paradox   area, one in effect commits oneself to the belief that, at   least in the context   of   a realistic measurement, it will always be impossible in practice to see any effects of the interference between the different macroscopic states   X~~   (and   hence,   a fortiori,   to test the hypothesis   that   the true description   at   the macroscopic level   is   not   of this type).   It   is   evidently this belief which   most   physicists   feel   justifies them in relegating questions   about   the validity   and   consistency of quantum   mechanics   at   the   macroscopic   level   to   the   realm   of the 'philosophical' (which, in the loose usage   of   the physics community, appears to mean   just   about   anything which   at   the   moment   cannot   be subjected   to   direct experimental test). In   the days of the original controversies   about   the interpretation   of the   quantum   formalism, in the first   few   decades   of   its existence, such a belief was no   doubt   well justified.   In   the 1980s, however, I believe   that the question looks a good deal more complex.   What   has changed the situation qualitatively in the last decade   or   two   is   our   ability to pro- duce   in   the   laboratory   systems   where   there   is   a   genuine   hope   of attaining   the   conditions   where   not   only   does   quantum   mechanics predict   that   the state   is   a linear superposition   of   macroscopically differ- ent states,   but   where the consequences   of   such a description are differ- ent, in   an   experimentally testable way, from the consequences of   other

            102   A.   J.   Leggett  types   of   assumption such as the scheme suggested above, in which already by this stage the system has evolved into a definite macro- scopic state. I have discussed the conditions necessary to attain this state of affairs,   and   the systems which are the most promising can- didates for it, in detail elsewhere   22,   and   will here merely review briefly what seems   to   be the experiment most likely to be feasible.   One   takes a superconducting ring closed by a Josephson junction ('rf   SQUID') and   imposes   on   it a controlled external magnetic flux. The system will then respond by generating currents which circulate in such a way that   the total   trapped   flux,   qJ,   is   different from   that   applied externally; in thermal equilibrium it will choose a value of   qJ   which makes its free energy   F(qJ)   a local minimum. This allows (at least) two different kinds of experiments.   In   one kind (known in the literature as 'macroscopic quantum   tunnelling'   or   MQT)   one   traps   the flux   in a   metastable minimum   and   tries to detect its 'escape' into a more stable minimum by a   quantum   tunnelling process.   In   the   other   ('macroscopic   quantum coherence'   or   MQC)   one chooses the value   of   the externally imposed flux so   that   F(   qJ)   has two   degenerate   minima which are separated by an   energy   barrier;   the   situation   then   resembles   that   found   in   the ammonia   molecule,   and   one looks for the coherent oscillations be- tween the two states which are the analog   of   the   ammonia   inversion resonance. The point   of   both   kinds   of   experiment is   that   by any reason- able criterion the states which are connected by the process of tun- nelling through the potential barrier are   macroscopically different   (in particular, a macroscopic   number   of   electrons circulate clockwise   or counter-clockwise in the two states respectively). Thus, observation of the   quantum-mechanically   predicted   behavior should   constitute   at least circumstantial evidence   (cf.   below)   that   the   quantum   formalism still works for such macroscopic superpositions,   and   conversely failure of the predictions might suggest the hypothesis   that   at   the macro- scopic level   quantum   mechanics needs to be replaced   or   supplemented by physical laws of a qualitatively different type. At the time   of   writing a number of experiments   on   MQT   have already been done, though most   of   these are   on   a system (a so-called current-biassed junction) which   is   related   but   not   identical to the one described above (for a review see references   22   and   23).   Most   of these experiments have found a tunnelling behavior which is   at   least qual- itatively consistent with the quantum-mechanical predictions. How- ever, it   is   difficult to assess to what extent they   exclude   alternative hypotheses. The   MQC   experiment, if it can be done, should be much more informative in this   respect.   In   fact,   it can   be shown   24   that, provided suitable values   of   the parameters can be attained, the be- havior predicted by   quantum   mechanics in this experiment   is   in con- flict with the conjunction   of   two very basic 'commonsense' assump- tions   about   the macroscopic world, namely   that   a macroscopic system which has available to it two macroscopically different states:

            Reflections   on   the quantum measurement paradox   103  must always 'actually be' in one state   or   the other: and 2   can in principle be detected to be so with arbitrarily small effect on   the state   or   its subsequent macroscopic dynamics. Thus the   MQC   experiment would discriminate definitively between quantum   mechanics   and   any theory of the alternative class discussed above which proposed to   replace it   at   the level of a macroscopic superconducting device   or   below. Although this experiment   of   course could   not   refute (or confirm) alternative   theories   which   predicted   a   deviation   from   quantum mechanics only   at   the level of systems more complex,   or   more highly organized in (say) a biological sense,   than   the   rather   crude system formed   by a   superconducting device,   I   believe   nevertheless   that   a clearcut result in either direction would constitute a very   important input into discussions of the   quantum   measurement problem. A result in conflict with   quantum   mechanics would (after all the loopholes in theory   and   experiment   had   been plugged!) obviously throw the whole question back into the melting-pot. A result in accordance with the quantum   predictions would   no   doubt   at   first sight be less spectacular; however, I believe   that   it should make us even more sceptical   about the   'orthodox'   resolution of the paradox.   For   if in this (admittedly very special) case the linear superposition of two   macroscopically   differ- ent states can be shown   experimentally   not   to be equivalent to a classi- cal mixture of these states, then it becomes   that   much less plausible to argue   that   in all other cases, where   we   have no direct experimental evidence to the contrary, the pure state has by some magical process been converted into a mixture (or, rather, has been converted into a definite   but   unknown macroscopic state). At the very least, it would force advocates of this resolution to specify with considerably more precision   than   has been done in the past exactly what aspects of the 'macroscopic' n'ature   of   the system they believe are relevant to the process in question. Although   the   above   ideas   are   different   in   detail   from   those promoted by David Bohm, I believe they are very much in the spirit of his approach   to   physics,   and   in particular of his long-standing concern with the fragmentation of   our   world-view imposed by the orthodox   interpretations   of   quantum   mechanics.   It   is   a pleasure to dedicate this essay to him   on   the occasion of his retirement   and   to wish him many more happy years of scientific activity.

            6 Quantum   physics and conscious   thought  Roger Penrose   Mathematical Institute,   Oxford  There   can   be   few   physicists   who   have delved as deeply   into   the philo- sophical implications   of   their subject as has   David   Bohm.   It   is there- fore with some   trepidation   that   I   am   paying my respects   to   him   on the occasion   of   his retirement with   an   attempt   of   my   own   to   relate questions   of   philosophy   to   those   of   the foundations   of   physics.   The viewpoint   that   I   am   putting   forward here   attempts   to   relate questions that   have been two   of   Bohm's   major   interests over the years; namely, a possible   breakdown   of   quantum   mechanics   on   a macroscopic scale and   the physical basis   of   conscious thought.   It   must   be evident   to   the reader   that   in   both   these topics I   am   venturing   into   dangerously specula- tive territory.   Moreover   others   more   expert   that   I (such as Wigner   1, as well as   Bohm   2   himself) have   put   forward strongly-reasoned views which relate these topics. Yet I   do   feel   that   my   own   viewpoint is   both well   worth   describing   and   sufficiently different from these   others   that the   reader   may   find something   of   value here. But my   account   must necessarily be   somewhat   truncated, for reasons   of   space   and   of   time. It   is   my   intention   to   expand   these   thoughts   at   much   greater length elsewhere.  1   Problems   with   quantum   theory  Let me begin by expressing my personal worries   and   beliefs   about   the quantum   theory. First, let it be said   without   reservation   that   the basic scheme, for all its philosophical difficulties,   is   an   extraordinarily beauti- ful   mathematical   structure.   The   strength   of   the theory   (and   here I refer   to   standard   non-relativistic   quantum   theory,   not   to   quantum field theory) lies   not   just   in the unbelievable range   and   accuracy   of 105

It   is   here   that   I have always   had   difficulties   with most hidden- variable   theories.   To   me,   it   is   no   help   just   to   improve   upon   the underlying philosophy of   quantum   mechanics by the introduction of hidden variables if the price to be paid   is   the sacrifice of this math- ematical elegance. Yet it must also be emphasized that, in my view, the   standard   theory   is   indeed   quite   unsatisfactory   philosophically. Like Einstein   and   his hidden-variable followers, I believe strongly   that it   is   the purpose of physics to   provide   an   objective   description   of reality. However, I   do   not   regard   indeterminacy,   in the ordinary sense of that   word,   as   being   necessarily   objectionable.   We   have   become accustomed,   through   classical physics, to a picture of the world whose future evolution is completely determined by   data   on   an   initial Cauchy hypersurface. Yet I find nothing   a priori   appealing   about   the idea. We know from results of general relativity (Penrose   3,   Hawking   and   Ellis   4) that   there are otherwise seemingly acceptable space-times for which no Cauchy hypersurface exists. More serious are two other objections. In   the first place, the   accuracy   with which one needs to know the initial   data   in   order   to be certain   about   the qualitative development of a system   is   absurdly unreasonable (Born   5,   Feynman   et   al.   6 )   and easily swamped by   quantum   uncertainties (if   that   is   not   begging the question).   In   the second place, there   is   always the problem   of   deciding  ~vhat   initial   data   one should be choosing. It seems to me to be of little value to know   that   there   is   some   initial   data   containing all information if one has no rules for determining what   that   initial   data   is   allowed to be   or   likely to be. Considering things   on   the ultimate universal scale, one needs, it would seem, some theory to tell us how the universe actually started off,   or   at   least which provides probability values for the different pos- sible initial   data   sets. But if it   is   the latter, it seems to me   that   one   is not   really better off   than   with a non-deterministic theory. I see no reason to be happier   about   feeding probabilities into the universe's initial state   than   peppering them   throughout   the space-time, as   is   done in the   standard   interpretation of   quantum   mechanics.   If,   on   the other hand,   the   initial   state   is   to   be   determined   uniquely   by   some   new principle, then   we   have the problem of understanding the extreme complication   and   curious interplay between precisely-operating physi- cal laws   on   the one hand,   and   the presence of   apparent   total ran- domness   on   the other. The picture   is   not   an   entirely hopeless one, however.   One   is   beginning to become accustomed to the great math- ematical complication, variety   and   apparent   randomness   that   can arise with very simple   and   precise mathematical transformations, especi- ally where iterative procedures are involved   (cf.   Ott   7   and   references therein).   So   perhaps   all   the   complication,   variety   and   apparent

            Quantunl physics and conscious thought   107  randomness   that   we   see all   about   us, as well as the precise physical laws, are all exact   and   unambiguous consequences   of   one single co- herent mathematical structure. Such a view I would call   strong determinism.   My   guess   is   that   Eins- tein   8   was hinting   at   such a possibility in his famous remark   'What I'm really interested in is whether   God   could have made the world in a different   way;   that   is,   whether the   necessity   of   logical simplicity leaves any freedom   at   all.'   Perhaps   this view would represent the ulti- mate   'optimistic'   attitude   to   the   goals   of   science.   Yet   strong   de- terminism   is   quite unlike ordinary determinism. There   is   not   now any question of the future state being determined by   data   on   an   initial Cauchy hypersurface. The entire future (and past)   is   simply fixed by theory once   and   for all! I   do   not   propose to take sides   on   this grandiose issue. We are clearly extremely far from such a 'theory', even if eventually a viewpoint   of that   kind were to   turn   out   to be 'correct'.   My   immediate purpose in bringing   such   matters   up   is   largely   to   point   out   that,   strong de- terminism aside, it seems   no   worse to feed probabilities into the theory 'peppered'   throughout   the space-time   than   to feed them all into the initial conditions. I shall return to strong determinism later. At this point I should make mention   of   the many-worlds types of viewpoint   9.   10. 11.   Here   one may   be allowed a form   of   'strong de- terminism without determinism'. The totality   of   all possible universes may be thought   of   as a single structure - the   omnium   (this terminology was suggested to me by Peter Derow) -   and   one might take the view that   it   is   the omnium   that   is   completely fixed by mathematical rules. The   probabilities   (or   randomness)   now   arise   owing   to   the   uncer- tainties involved in the question   of   where one finds oneself located within the omnium. This 'location' involves   not   only one's spatiotem- poral location within a particular universe branch,   but   also the selec- tion   of   that   particular branch itself. Unsatisfied   though   I   am   by such a world-view, I   do   not   have any really fundamental   objection to pictures   of   this general kind.   One problem I   do   have with them, however,   is   that   the continual branching of   the world   and   the threading   of   my own consciousness through it would seem to result in my becoming separated from the tracks of consciousness of all my friends. This   is   what I have referred to as the 'zombie' theory of the world   12.   It   seems to me   that   one needs a re- spectable theory   of   consciousness before the many-worlds view can hang together as a physical theory   and   as a viable interpretation   of quantum   mechanics. This strikes me as a tall   order   at   the present time. I shall have more to say   about   the many-worlds viewpoint later. Let   us   now   consider   what   the   standard   formalism   of   quantum mechanics has to say   about   the evolution of the world. Taking this formalism   at   its face value,   we   have a state vector   It/!   >   which evolves for   a   while   according   to   the   completely deterministic   Schrodinger

            108   Roger   Penrose  equation. (If preferred,   one   could   of   course use the Heisenberg picture instead, in which case the state itself   is   considered   not   to   evolve in time.   The   distinction   is   not   important   for   my   purposes.   The   two pictures are completely equivalent,   but   I feel   that,   at   least for a   non- relativistic discussion,   the   Schrodinger   picture   is   less confusing.) Then, at   odd   times,   when   an   'observation'   is deemed   to   have been made, the Schrodinger-evolved state vector   is   discarded   and   replaced by   another, which   is   selected   in   a   random   way, with specific   probability   weight- ings, from   among   the   eigenvectors   of   the   operator   corresponding   to the observation. As   has   been   argued   on   innumerable   occasions, this is   a wholly unsatisfactory   procedure   for a   fundamental   description   of the 'real world'.   There   are,   of   course, very   many   different   attitudes   to the resolution   of   this problem,   and   it   is   not   my   purpose   here   to   enter into   a discussion   of   all   of   them,   but   some   brief   remarks   will be in order. In   the first place, it   is   often   argued   that   It/!   >   itself   should   not   be regarded as giving   an   objective description   of   the world   (or   of   part   of it)   but   as   providing   information   merely   of   'one's state   of   knowledge' about   the world.   This   view I really   cannot   accept.   Quite   apart   from the question as   to   who   the   'one'   might   be in this   statement   (and   the 'one'   is   surely   not   me!), it seems   to   me   to   be perfectly clear   that   there   is (if we accept   standard   quantum   mechanics) a   completely objective meaning   to   It/!   > -   at   least   to   the   ray   determined   by   It/!   >   in the   Hilbert space (so   that   uncertainty   It/!   >   I~   e i8   1t/!   >   is   not   of   significance).   For we   can, in principle (according   to   the theory), set   up   a   measurement defined by the   operator:  Q   =   It/!><t/JI  and   find   that   It/!   >   (assumed normalized:   <   t/!It/!   >   =   1)   is   the   unique  state   (up   to   phase)   corresponding   to   the eigenvalue unity for   Q.   This  It/!   >   is   distinguished from all   other   states by the fact   that   it yields the value unity with   certainty   for the   measurement   Q.   This   is   an   entirely objective   property,   so we conclude   that   (if the   theory   is   correct) the property   of   being in   state   It/!   >   is, indeed, completely objective. In   practice, however, it   may   well   turn   out   that   the   actual   performing of   the   measurement   Q   is quite   out   of   the   question   and   it   is   in such circumstances   that   I   would   myself begin   to   doubt   that   It/!   >   actually describes 'reality'. (There   are   situations, in the   context   of   relativity   or in connection with time-symmetry considerations, where the 'reality' of   It/!   >   seems   to   lead   to   a   paradox;   cf.   Penrose   12.   I   am   not   concerned with   such   matters   here,   but   such   'paradoxes'   are   part   of   my   own doubts   about   the   complete validity   of   the   quantum   formalism.)   To reject the objective view requires a denial   of   one   of   the   fundamental tenets   of   quantum   theory:   any   (bounded)   Hermitian   operator,   such as Q,   represents a   measurement   that   could   in principle be made. So it seems   to   me   that   one   must   take   it   that   in   quantum   mechanics

            Quantum physics and conscious thought   109  the state vector   is   actually intended to represent 'reality'. The trouble comes,   of   course, when a measurement is made for which   It/!   >   is   not  in   an   eigenstate.   Now   It/!   >   jumps   non-deterministically into some new state   -   this   is   state-vector   reduction.   Because   of   this   lack   of de- terminism it   is   not   possible to consider such behaviour as resulting from the Schrodinger evolution   of   some larger system which includes the   apparatus   configuration as   part   of   the state. (Some attempts have been made to pin the blame for this indeterminism   on   a lack   of   know- ledge   about   the environment, the claim being   that   when this   random environment   is   taken into account, Schrodinger evolution might hold always. I have   not   yet found these attempts   to   be very believable   and I shall ignore this possibility in the discussion which follows.) So it seems   that   quantum   mechanics asserts   two   quite distinct   types   of evolution:   deterministic   Schrodinger evolution   and   state-vector   re- duction. If   we   accept   that   state-vector reduction   is   a real physical process - and   the physical objectivity   of   the state vector itself seems to imply this (leaving the many-worlds viewpoint aside) - then   we   may ask:   at what stage does such a reduction take place? Again there are different views. Perhaps it occurs quickly   and   spontaneously   at   some level   just not   quite   reached   by experiments designed   to detect   violations   in Schrodinger evolution.   Or   perhaps it   itS   delayed until the latest allow- able moment, as the results   of   the observation finally enter the mind of some   conscious   observer (Wigner   1).   As   we   well know (von Neu- mann   13)   either view,   or   any   other   viewpoint according to which the reduction takes place   at   some intermediate stage between these two extremes,   is   equally   and   completely compatible with all the experi- ments. This frustrating   and   beautiful fact is,   at   one   and   the same   time~  among   the greatest strengths   and   the most disturbing weaknesses of the theory. It   is   such a strength because it enables the theory to oper- ate - as it does with such extraordinary accuracy   and   power - without our   needing to have the remotest idea   of   what 'actually' takes place during   the   reduction   process.   This   strength   is   also   the   theory's weakness, since for   that   very reason it offers us almost no clue as to what   is   physically going   on   during reduction. Moreover, it leads us into endless arguments   about   'interpretation' where strange (and, to my mind, highly questionable) philosophy   is   often invoked to lull one into thinking   that   no new physical theory   is   needed to explain the details of the actual physics   of   reduction. The reader will realize   that   I   am   expressing a very personal view here,   and   that   much more discussion   and   open-mindedness   is   required than   I have allowed myself in the foregoing remarks. However, my purpose here   is   not   to be open-minded   but   to make some suggestions, so I hope   that   the reader will continue to bear with me and, instead, take   upon   himself   or   herself this   burden   of open-mindedness.

            110   Roger   Penrose  to make some comments concerning the place to look for a new physi- cal theory   of   reduction,   and   then to   make   a speculative suggestion as to how this might ultimately relate to the   phenomenon   of conscious- ness.   In   bearing with me, the reader must, as a first step, be prepared to envisage   that   there   is   indeed a real physical process   of   reduction, where the Schrodinger   equation   and   linearity are presumably   both violated   and   where determinism may perhaps be violated also. It   may seem that, as I   am   suggesting a connection with conscious- ness, I propose   to   follow the Wigner   1   extreme, where reduction takes place only   at   the level   of   conscious thought.   In   fact I   am   not   at   all happy   with   that   viewpoint   and   my suggestions with   regard   to   re- duction will be quite different. I share the discomfort of many others that   the 'Wigner view' seems   to   imply a markedly different physical behaviour in   our   own small   corner   of   the universe from   that   which would be taking place almost everywhere else, in the absence of local conscious   observers   to   keep   things   under   control.   Of   course,   von Neumann   again comes   to   the aid   of   that   viewpoint to ensure   that   no contradiction with actual observation (by conscious beings) occurs. Or   so it would seem.   In   any case, I personally find such a lop-sided picture   of   a   real   physical universe   too   unattractive to be believable. Alternatively, as quite a   number   of   physicists now seem to argue, perhaps one should go   beyond   Wigner   and   say   that   reduction fails   to take place, even   at   the level   of   consciousness. This leads us, instead, to Everett's   many-worlds   picture.   It   seems   that   the   main   motivation behind this idea is the understandable desire for economy   and   uni- formity   of   description.   Rather   than   having to   have two   seemingly incompatible   modes   of   evolution   for   the   universe -   Schrodinger's equation   and   reduction -   is   it   not   more   economical   and   unified to settle   just   for the former   and   discard the latter? A faith in the elegance of Schrodinger   linearity   and   the   strong   experimental   support   for Schrodinger evolution are   among   the arguments   put   forward for this view,   but   in my opinion   both   arguments are somewhat misconceived. Linearity seems elegant only when one has   not   seen   an   even more attractive, essentially non-linear, generalization.   (Compare   the analogy of   Newtonian   gravity   and   general relativity.) And the unquestionably impressive experimental   support   that   quantum   theory continues to have   is   not   for the Schrodinger evolution   of   a   quantum   state.   It   is   for that   absurd   concoction   of   Schrodinger evolution   on   the one   hand   and state-vector   reduction   on   the   other   which   defines   the   standard Copenhagen interpretation.   That   is   where the   support   lies   and   it   is  that   with which   we   must come to terms in   our   attempts   toward   an improved theory.

            Quantum physics and conscious thought   111  2   Quantum   gravity   and   ,reduction  What   we seek, I   am   therefore claiming, is a new theory,   presumably non-linear   and   possibly non-deterministic, which: 1   is   extremely   accurately   approximated,   for   reasonably   small   or simple systems,   by   a Schrodinger-evolving   state   vector;   and 2   accords   closely, for systems which   are   large   or   complicated, with reduction   and   with   the   standard   replacement   of   probability   amp- litudes   by   the   probabilities   of   actual   alternative   outcomes. (See Pearle   14,   15,   16   for a very serious   concrete   proposal   of   this kind.) In   various   other   places   17,18   I   have   put   forward   arguments   to   support my   own   viewpoint   that   the   essential new   and   non-linear   physical   input should   be general-relativistic gravity,   together   with   certain   considera- tions   about   the   second   law   of   thermodynamics   and   the   apparently strongly   time-asymmetric   constraints   on   the   structure   of   space-time singularities. I   do   not   wish   to   repeat   the   details   of   my   (rather   round- about)   argument   here.   My   latest   thinking   on   this   question   is being presented   elsewhere   19   and   I refer   the   interested   reader   to   that   source for   more   details.   In   my   opinion   there   are   indeed   strong   grounds   for believing   that   for a   quantum   gravity   theory   to   have   any   chance   of real success it   must   incorporate   among   its   important   features a precise and   objective   theory   of   state-vector   reduction.   (A   different   line   of thought,   also leading   to   the   conclusion   that   state-vector   reduction is a   gravitational   phenomenon,   had   earlier been   put   forward   by   Kar- olyhazy   20;   see   Karolyhazy,   Frenkel   and   Lukacs   21   for   an   upÂ·-to-date account   of   these ideas;   cf.   also   Komar   22   .) There   are   various   reasons   for   thinking   that   the   structure   of   quantum mechanics   may   well   have   to   be   modified in   the   context   of   general relativity.   One   of   these   concerns   the   choice   of   variables with respect to   which   the   process   of   'quantization'   is   to   be   conducted.   In   the   stan- dard   non-relativistic   (or   special-relativistic)   quantization   procedure one   has   the   canonical   variables   x a,   Pa   of   position   and   momentum which   are   made   into   non-commuting   operators   and   whose (canonical) Poisson   bracket   relations   are   replaced   by   (canonical)   commutators.   It would   not   be valid   to   apply   this   quantization   procedure   instead   to some   other   variables   x a,   Pa'   obtained   from   xa   and   Pa   by   an   arbitrary canonical   transformation,   again   replacing   the   canonical   Poisson bracket   relations   of   x a   and   Pa   by   canonical   commutators.   It   might, for example, be   the   case   that   xa   is   related   to   x   a   by   some   arbitrary co-ordinate   transformation,   with   canonical   conjugate   Pa   corres- pondingly   chosen,   and   then   the   canonical   quantization   procedure will   not   in general   apply   to   x a   and   Pa.   What   distinguishes the   stan- dard   (xa,Pa)   from   the   more   arbitrary   (xa,Pa)   (cf.   Komar   23   )   is   its direct   relation   to   the   symmetry   group   of   flat   space-time,   so   that  Pa   indeed   represents   the   standard   (conserved)   energy-momentum concept.

            112   Roger   Penrose  It   will be   noted   that   this selection principle for 'preferred' canonical variables will   not   work in a curved space-time. This   is   a much more immediate problem   than   the   daunting   difficulties involved in trying to quantize   the   gravitational   field   itself,   since   it   arises   already   when gravity   is   simply   taken   to be   an   unquantized   background   field. Thus, even   at   this simplified level, the   standard   quantum-mechanical pro- cedures   run   into difficulties.   One   does not, in fact,   have any clear rules for a quantizing procedure, in the general case.   When   one   is asked the question   of   whether the   incorporation   of   space-time curva- ture into physics in any way affects the general framework   and   rule of   procedure   of   quantum   mechanics, one   is   forced to reply (if truthful) that   one does   not   even know   what   the rules are, in a general curved- space setting! It seems   that   in curved space, one   must   resort to some   'patchwork' formalism and,   at   best, much   of   the compelling elegance   of   quantum mechanics   is   removed.   It   has become fashionable to argue that, in view   of   the   abounding   difficulties   that   have   been   encountered   in attempts to quantize general relativity, one should replace   that   theory by some   other   which might   more   willingly submit to   being forced into the linear framework   of   standard   quantum   theory. Yet it   is   not often suggested   that   the   quantum   framework might itself be forced to yield.   I   would   not   dispute   that   some   changes   in   classical   general relativity must necessarily result if a successful union with   quantum physics   is   to be achieved,   but   I would argue strongly   that   these must be   accompanied   by   equally   profound   changes   in   the   structure   of quantum   mechanics   itself.   The   elegance   and   profundity   of   general relativity   is   no   less   than   that   of   quantum   theory.   The   successful bringing   of   the two together will never be achieved, in my view, if one insists   on   sacrificing the elegance   and   profundity   of   either one in   order to preserve intact   that   of the other.   What   must be sought instead   is   a grand   union   of   the two - some theory with a depth, beauty   and   charac- ter   of   its own   (and   which will be   no   doubt   recognized by the strength of these qualities when it   is   found)   and   which includes   both   general relativity   and   standard   quantum   theory   as   two   particular limiting cases. This   is   all very well, the reader   is   no   doubt   thinking,   but   what rele- vance has the extremely weak   phenomenon   of   even classical gravity -   let alone the absurdly tiny   and   quite undetectable   ,'quantum   cor- rections'   that   one anticipates would result from a   quantum   gravity theory - to the commonplace   phenomenon   of   reduction?   Whether   one contends   that   reduction occurs early   or   late in the chain of alternatives - whether reduction has already physically taken place with the track in a cloud   chamber   or   mark   on   a   photographic   plate,   or   whether it   is delayed until it affects the state of a   human   brain - in either case only tiny   amounts   of energy are involved, by the   standards   of gravitation theory. Yet it   is   my contention   that   it   is   this link with gravity which

            Quantum physics   and   conscious thought   113  effects the   apparent   change in rules   that   takes place with reduction. When   two states   of   differing energy distribution are linearly super- posed, the slightly differing space-time geometries   that   these energy distributions produce (according to general relativity) must also be superposed. This   is   not   clearcut   matter   since, as   we   have seen, the geometry   is   not   just   a 'physical state'   but   is   something essentially involved in the very determination of the 'procedure of quantization' (cf.   foregoing remarks concerning   x   a,   Pa   and   ~xa,   Pa).   It   is   hard   to see how   'quantization   procedures' are to be superposed. I would contend, therefore,   that   when two geometries involved in a linear superposition become   too   different from one   another   - in some yet-to-be-determined precise sense -   then linear superposition fails to hold,   and   some effective non-linear instability sets in, resulting in one or   the   other   geometry winning out, the result being   reduction.   However, the criterion for deciding when such   an   instability becomes operative cannot   depend solely   on   the energies   or   masses involved.   The   masses involved in cloud   chamber   droplets,   or   relevant collections of silver iodide molecules in a   photograph,   or   configurations in a brain, would appear   to be very tiny -   apparently tinier   than   the Planck-Wheeler mass   of   10-   5   g which   seems to   characterize   the   scale   of   quantum gravity -   which, in   turn, might   perhaps   be smaller   than   the   total electron   mass   involved   in   a   coherent   quantum   state   for   a   large superconducting coil. Some care will be needed in deciding   upon   the precise measure   of   mass-energy distribution difference   that   is   needed to trigger off the instabilities   of   reduction. My   earlier arguments   17,18   have emphasized the time-asymmetric role   of   entropy   in reduction   and   the gravitational origin (via time- asymmetry in space-time singularity structure)   of   the second law   of thermodynamics.   For   an   overall consistency   of   the physics involved, it   is   argued   that   gravity   ought   also to be critically relevant to the quantum-mechanical reduction process. But it   is   gravity in its role of providing a   gravitational entropy   that   enters.   In   the early stages   of   the universe (at the big bang) the   entropy   content   of   the   matter   was high. The   second   law   arises   because,   at   the   singularity,   something con- strained the   entropy   of   gravity   to be extremely low, whereas the po- tential for   entropy   content   of (conformally) curved space-time was enormously high. As   the   universe   evolves,   this   unused   potential   of   gravitational entropy   is   gradually   taken   up (clumping of gas into stars, etc.)   and   is directly   or   indirectly   taken   advantage of by systems requiring a low entropy reservoir (e.g. plants making use   of   degradable   photons   from the sun, which   is   a   hot   spot in the sky by virtue of its gravitational clumping). The ultimate high value of entropy for a gravitationally clumped object   is   achieved by the black-hole state. This   entropy   can be   given   in   precise   terms   by   the   Bekenstein-Hawking formula   (cf. Wald   24)   and   we   find   that   for   an   ordinary black hole, resulting from

            114   Roger Penrose  the collapse   of,   say, a ten solar-mass star, the entropy per baryon   is some twenty orders   of   magnitude larger   than   even the seemingly huge value of   10 8   or   so (taking units with Boltzmann's constant as unity) for the thermal black-body radiation left over from the   hot   big bang. Even when this maximum entropy value   is   not   achieved, the gra- vitational entropy can be quite sizable, though as yet no precise de- termination of this entropy has been suggested. In a rough way,   we can say   that   this entropy   is   intended to estimate (the logarithm of) the number of   quantum   states   that   go to make up a given classical geometry. Such   an   entropy measure would have to be very much a non-local expression. But this   is   not   surprising in general relativity, where   even   energy   must   be   given   by   a   non-local   expression   (cf. Penrose   and   Rindler   25). The idea   is   that, for 'reduction' to take place,   we   must be in a situ- ation where, such as in the localization   of   a   photon   on   a photographic plate, the lowering of entropy   that   this 'reduction' would seem   to entail must be   at   least compensated by a corresponding increase in the gravitational entropy, this gravitational entropy being higher for clumped localized energy distributions   than   for those which are spread out   more uniformly. (This cannot be just the 'quantum-mechanical entropy', which remains   at   zero so long as one uses a pure-state de- scription,   but   is   some more   'commonsense',   though   somewhat   ill- defined, entropy concept which increases as more   and   more degrees of freedom become involved. I am grateful to P. Pearle for illuminat- ing discussions concerning this.   Quantum   reduction must be a non- local process,   and   the hope   is   that   this non-locality can be matched with the non-locality involved in the gravitational entropy concept. It will be clear to the reader   that   there   is   much speculation   and lack   of   precision in   this   picture.   (For   more clarification, see   Pen- rose   19.)   But my purpose here   is   not   to spell   out   in detail how the re- duction   procedure might   work   (which   I cannot do,   not   having a proper'theory)   but   merely to attempt to persuade the reader   of   the plausibility   of   there being   some   new physical process going   on   which has a perfectly objective character, even though   we   do   not   understand how this process works in detail. I would certainly anticipate, however, that the process   is   likely to defy any meaningful local description in ordinary space-time terms. But any speculation involved in the 'details' of this process will, I suppose, pale to insignificance by comparison with the speculative aspects of what I have to suggest in the next section -   where I turn to what will (at first)   seem to be a totally different topic!  3   Concerning   the   physics   of   conscious   thought  There has been a great deal   of   discussion in recent years - since the emergence of modern high-speed computers -   of   the question as to

            Quantum physics   and   conscious thought   115  whether   human   thought   can be adequately understood in terms of computational algorithms. There   is   a   rather   prevalent school of belief (cf.   Hofstadter   26)   which maintains   that   an   algorithm (or perhaps the end-product of   an   algorithm)   is   itself all   that   'counts' in determining whether 'thoughts',   or   even 'conscious feelings', have been achieved during the implementation of   that   algorithm. According to this view, the actual physical nature   of   the device which carries   out   the algorithm is   of   no   consequence. The point of view   is   a strongly 'operationalist' one   and   springs, to a large extent, from a well-known   and   penetrating discussion due to Turing   27   ,   according to which   an   experimenter has to decide, merely by means of questions   and   answers (transmitted impersonally with, say, keyboard   and   display screen), which of two 'subjects'   is   a   human   being   and   which   is   a computer, the computer having been   programmed   to imitate   human   responses as closely as possible. This has become known as the 'Turing test',   and   the point of view to which I have referred ('strong AI') would maintain   that   once a computer has satisfactorily passed this test (i.e. has become able to imitate   human   responses closely enough to be able to 'fool' a per- ceptive experimenter), then all the   normal   terms such as 'thought', 'understanding', 'awareness', 'happiness', 'pain', 'compassion', 'pride', etc., could be as meaningfully   and   as truthfully applied to the com- puter as to the   human   subject. I   do   not   believe   that   it would be strongly disputed   that   computer technology (both   at   the hardware   and   software ends)   is   some good way from attaining this avowed goal. Nevertheless,   at   a much more restrictive level, there are already computer programmes which can respond   to   extremely simple types of stories in the English language. The   computer   can provide answers   to   elementary   but   slightly indirect questions   about   the story, these answers seeming to indicate some very   primitive   'understanding'   of the   content   of the   story   by   the computer. However, Searle   28   has argued impressively   that   answers   of this   sort   need in no way imply   that   any kind of 'understanding' has actually been achieved by such a mechanism since, in place of the electronics   of the   computer,   one   could   use   human   beings   blindly following instructions   and   they need have no inkling of the 'meaning' of the story in   order   to carry   out   these instructions successfully. It seems to me to be clear   that   in this essential respect Searle   is correct   and   we   have no reason   to   apply such a word as 'understanding' to the operations of a mechanism, electronic   or   otherwise, of this kind. It   appears   that   Searle   is   willing to concede   that   at   some stage com- puters (of present-day type,   but   improved in speed, storage capacity and   logical design) may be able to pass the Turing test proper (let us say, by 100 years from now)   but   that   we   would still have no reason to attribute to them such   human   qualities as I have mentioned.   Most particularly,   we   would have no reason to attribute to them any form of conscious awareness. Thus, according to Searle, the actual physical

            116   Roger Penrose  material   and   detailed construction   of   a 'computer' (i.e. the 'hardware') may, for such qualities, be   of   'crucial' importance. My own personal view is very much in sympathy with this, though it remains what I believe to be a highly significant difference. I would agree   that   the actual   physical   construction of the proposed 'thinking device'   is   likely to be crucial,   but   not   merely with regard to the ap- propriateness   of   such terms as 'conscious awareness'. I think   that   the physical (or biological)   nature   of   the 'device' is likely to be crucial also in determining the effectiveness   of   its very operation. I would contend that   the evolutionary development,   through   natural   selection, of the ability to think consciously indicates   that   consciousness   is   playing   an  active   role   and   has   provided   an   evolutionary   advantage   to   those possessing it.   For   various reasons I find it   hard   to believe   that   con- scious   awareness   is   merely   a   concomitant   of   sufficiently   complex modes   of   thinking -   and   it seems to me clear   that   consciousness   is itself   functional.  People behave quite differently while in the states   of   full conscious awareness from when they are   not   properly conscious   of   what they are doing (such as while daydreaming, sleepwalking   or   in a state of epi- leptic   'fugue').   Indeed,   if consciousness   had   no   operational   effect on   behaviour, then conscious beings would never voice their puzzle- ment   about   the   conscious   state   and   would   behave   just   like   un- conscious mechanisms 'untroubled' by such irrelevancies! Moreover, I am   very much aware that, in my own thinking, there are certain kinds of problem for which conscious appraisal is essential, whereas there are others - those which are 'automatic', there being a clearly defined algorithm which I have previously learnt (like walking   or   driving a car in very familiar circumstances) - for which conscious action   is   not needed. Why   do   some kinds   of   thinking seem to 'need' consciousness while others seem   not   to?   What   is   the crucial distinction between tasks   that require (or   at   least benefit from) conscious   thought   and   those   that appear   to have   no   real use for it? I   do   not   suppose   that   very clear answers to these questions can be given   at   present,   but   at   least there seems to be something very suggestive   about   the kind of terminology that   most readily springs to mind. Terms such as 'automatic', 'fol- lowing   rules   mindlessly',   'programmed'   and   even   'algorithm'   seem appropriate for various kind   of   mental processes   that   are   not   neces- sarily accompanied by conscious awareness. These are the kind of activities   that   most closely accord with the actions of computers as we   presently understand them.   On   the   other   hand, 'common sense', 'judgment   of   truth', 'understanding'   and   'artistic appraisal' are   among the terms one might use to describe mental activities   that   can seem- ingly be carried   out   effectively only when consciousness   is   present. For   these, one is much more in the   dark   in attempting to imitate human   thinking with computers.   It   seems   not   unnatural   to suggest,

            Quantum physics and conscious thought   117 therefore,   that   unconscious   mental   processes   (perhaps   such   as   can   be carried   out   by   the   cerebellum)   may   indeed   be effectively   imitated   by computers   which   do   not   differ in principle from   those   already   in exist- ence,   but   that   conscious   thinking   may   be   essentially   'non-algorithmic' in   its   nature   and   qualitatively   different   from   that   which   can   in   prin- ciple be   carried   out   by   such   computers. The   matter   is   perhaps   not   so   clearcut   as this, however.   In   the   first place it is   evident   that   many   unconscious   ingredients   are   present   in our   artistic   appraisals,   in   our   studied   judgments   and   in   our   common sense.   Though   we form   our   judgments   with   consciousness   as   an   appar- ently necessary ingredient, we   do   so   by   bringing   together   innumerable factors   of   logic, experience   and   prejudice, a   good   proportion   of   which we   are   probably   not   aware.   Perhaps   conscious   appraisals   are   no   less algorithmic   in   nature   than   unconscious,   'automatic'   actions,   but   are simply   incomparably   more   complicated   and   subtle   in   their   operation -   as   many   would   argue.   Perhaps,   then,   consciousness   is   simply   a concomitant   of   these higher-level   and   more   sophisticated   -   but   still algorithmic   -   operations   of   mental   machinery. This   is a view   that   gains   support   from   the   kind   of   picture   that   is now   most   commonly   presented   for   the   essential   workings   of   the   brain. A   complicated   network   of   neurones   and   synapses   is envisaged, where electrochemical   signals   propagate,   indulging   in   elementary   'logical' switching   processes -   apparently   similar   to   those   of   an   electronic computer,   though   with   a   probabilistic   ingredient.   This   all   seen1S   to   be something   that   could   be   imitated   closely   by   a   computer,   at   least in   principle.   The   additional   probabilistic   ingredient   would   seem   to present   no   real   problem.   Computers   can,   after   all,   easily   generate sequences   of   numbers   which   to   all   intents   and   purposes   behave   as random   sequences.   Or,   if preferred, (effectively)   random   sequences   can be   produced   by   suitable   physical   processes (e.g. decays   of   radioactive atoms)   which   could   easily   be   additionally   incorporated   into   the computer. In   any   case -   apart   from   the   fact   that   the   storage   capacity   is finite rather   than   being   unlimited   - is   one   not   simply   providing   an   instance of   a   Turing machine?   Any   computational   procedure   whatever   (in   the normal   sense   of   that   term)   comes   under   the   heading   of   a   procedure attainable   by   a   Turing   machine.   To   perform   a   computation,   one   is using a piece   of   physical   apparatus,   so   the   common   argument   goes, be it a   human   brain   or   an   electronic   computer   or   whatever, which is subject   to   the   normal   physical laws.   These   laws   are   of   the   usual   de- terministic   type   (classical,   or   else   Schrodinger,   time-evolution)   or entirely   probabilistic   (state-vector   reduction)   and,   as it   would   seem   at first sight,   are   of   the   type   which   could   be   carried   out   by   a   Turing machine   (with a limited   store)   with, if   need   be,   an   additional   random input. However,   the   question   of   computability,   with   ordinary   deterministic

            118   Roger Penrose  laws,   is   not   quite   so   straightforward   as   it   might   seem.   Indeed, according   to   Pour-EI   and   Richards   29,30,   there is   one   sense in which evolving even so simple a deterministic system   as   the   wave   equation in flat space   can   be   regarded   as a   non-computable   procedure.   But   this particular   sense is   probably   not   the   appropriate   one   in the present context. As they   point   out,   sufficiently   smooth   solutions   of   the wave equation   are   indeed   quite   adequately   computable   from   initial   data (say   by   means   of   the   Kirchhoff formula)   and   the   same   may   be basically true   also   of   the   other   main   deterministic   equations   of   physics, even though   there will be the   problems   of   stability, etc.,   that   I   mentioned in section   1. On   the   other   hand,   there is a critical   assumption   built   into   this discussion   that   the   operative   physical laws   are   indeed   of   the   type referred to, where deterministic classical   (or   Schrodinger)   evolution   is maintained, except where   punctuated   by the   random   procedure   of state-vector reduction. As I have been   arguing   in the earlier sections, one   needs   some   replacement   for   this   unhappy   combination,   the evolution   and   reduction   being seen as   approximations   to   some   more accurate   and   precise   grand   scheme.   It   seems   to   me   to   be   quite   on   the cards   that   this sought-for   grand   scheme   contains   an   effectively   non- computable   time-evolution.   It   would   be   my   view   that   the   brain   in its conscious   state   (or   the 'mind'?) is able   to   harness these effects   and make   use   of   whatever subtleties   are   involved   at   that   delicate borderline between linear Schrodinger   evolution   and   the   apparent   randomness of   reduction,   thereby   achieving effects far   beyond   those   attainable   by the   ordinary   operations   of   algorithmic computers. Non-computability   of   some   kind   seems also   to   be a necessary in- gredient   of   strong   determinism.   If   one   could   compute   the   full space- time state   of   the universe,   one   could   in principle   compute   one's   own future.   Then,   of   course,   one   might simply   choose   to   do   something different -   an   incompatibility with the feeling   of   free will. These ideas are,   of   course,   matters   of   considerable speculation, as present physical   and   physiological   understandings   go. Yet there   are very   many   instances where biological systems have been able   to   make extraordinarily   effective   use   of   subtle   physical   or   chemical   effects. Surely   the   greatest   of   evolution's achievements, the   development   of conscious awareness,   must   have needed   to   call   upon   physical processes even   more   profound   and   delicate   than   any   we have yet   understood. Any world in which minds   can   exist   must   be organized   on   principles far   more   subtle   and   beautifully controlled   than   those even   of   the magnificent physical laws   that   have so far been uncovered. At least, that   is   my   own   very   strong   opinion.

            7 Macroscopic   quantum   objects  T.   D.   Clark   School   of   Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University   of   Sussex  I first met David Bohm in the early spring   of   1976. At the time I   had the idea that, given suitable experimental conditions, certain kinds   of superconducting circuits should display   manifestly   quantum   mech- anical behaviour over macroscopic length scales. I hoped   that   such circuits would provide a new experimental vehicle for investigating quantum   mechanics. David Bohm was,   and   is,   one   of   the great authori- ties   on   the foundations   of   quantum   mechanics so it seemed natural that   I should seek his advice. I found him very approachable   and   he listened with great patience to my attempts to explain my still rather rudimentary physical views of these circuits. His encouragement then was a great morale booster for   our   group   at   Sussex. Eventually   we were able   to justify   that   encouragement.   We   now   have   supercon- ducting circuits roughly a centimetre across which behave as single quantum   objects. I would like to think   that   in due course these circuits will be   of   use in testing some   of   David Bahm's remarkable ideas concern- ing the nature   of   quantum   mechanics.  The   superconducting   state  In   1956   Cooper   1   demonstrated   that   the existence   of   an   arbitrarily small net attractive interaction between the conduction electrons of a metal leads inevitably to the formation of states   of   bound   pairs of electrons. Subsequently Bardeen,   Cooper   and   Schrieffer   2   showed   that such   an   attractive interaction could indeed exist in a metal. Pairs of electrons can interact attractively via the lattice ions. This attractive interaction   is   maximised when   the   pairing process occurs   between  121

These Cooper- pair   bosons   can,   through   Bose-Einstein   statistics,   occupy   a   single quantum   state extending over a macroscopic distance.   In   this state, which   we   identify with superconductivity, all the electron pairs have the   same   centre   of   mass   momentum.   It   is   useful   to   consider   the creation   of   the superconducting state in terms   of   pair overlap.   The electron-Iattice-electron interaction which leads to the formation   of Cooper   pairs   is   very weak   and   only has observable consequences   at low temperatures.   The   very small binding energy means   on   average the paired electrons are a large distance   apart,   roughly 10-   5   em in a typical superconductor.   Compared   with a single electron in a   normal metal,   an   electron   pair   in a superconductor occupies a large volume. However, it   can   only   do   so by co-existing in   that   same volume with approximately 10   6   other   pairs   3.   Obviously there exists a large overlap of   the wave functions   of   the   Cooper   pairs. This dictates   that   the phases of   these wave functions should be locked together over macroscopic length scales. This macroscopic phase coherence, which forces different points in a superconductor   to   have built-in phase relations, has far- reaching consequences.  Multiply   connected   superconductors  One   consequence   of   macroscopic phase coherence in superconductors appears   to   be   that   a state which is, in principle, many-bodied   can   be represented by a 'single particle' wave function,   i.e.   a single macro- scopic wave function for a very large   number   of   particles. This   can   be written as   4: [1J The   concept   of   a macroscopic single-particle wave function describing the correlated behaviour   of   a very large   number   of   superconducting pairs   leads   directly   to   the   requirement   for   lossless   diamagnetic screening currents   to   flow in the surface region   of   a superconductor in the presence   of   an   external applied magnetic field   5.   The   characteristic distance   over   which   external   magnetic   fields   are   screened   in   a superconductor is   known   as the   London   penetration   depth   ()"L)6. With the simple wave function [1J in mind, it   is   instructive to con- sider   the   case   of   a   superconducting   ring   with   a   thickness   large compared   with   )"L.   In   order   to   keep the wave function single-valued at   every point within the ring the phase   (<p)   of   the wave function [1J must change by zero   or   integer   (n)   x   211:   along a   path   around   the ring inside the bulk superconductor. This integer   n   is   known   as the winding number   of the superconducting ring.

Flux quantisation in thick superconducting rings   is   now a very well established experimental fact   7.   As   a phenomenon, however, it   is   of limited use since, for the case   of   a uniformly thick ring, the flux state can only be changed by warming the ring through its superconducting transition   temperature, followed   by cooling in a   different   ambient magnetic field. Fortunately another method exists for changing flux states which avoids this tedious procedure. In   1962 Josephson invented what   is   now known generically as the superconducting weak link   8.   In its simplest form the weak link con- sists   of   a tapered constriction roughly a   few   hundred angstroms across at   its narrowest section. This corresponds closely to the penetration depth   A L   in a superconductor. With dimensions as small as this, it   is relatively easy for magnetic flux to leak across the weak link and, as we   have shown   9,10,   this leakage takes place as a   quantum   mechanical process. Thus, in this context,   we   can consider a weak link as a device which couples together   quantum   mechanically different flux states   of a superconducting ring. From   the   above   discussion   it   is   clear   that   the   integer   (n<l>o'  n   =   0,   Â±   1,   Â±   2   ...   ) flux states exist in a   quantum   mechanical sense as macroscopically different states of a thick superconducting ring. These states, which have no classical analogue, are a consequence   of the macroscopic   quantum   behaviour   of   the ring.   In describing the behaviour of the thick ring it   is   useful to define the total included flux, which must be quantised as   n<l>o'   in terms   of   an   externally applied magnetic   <I> x   so that:  n<l>o   =   <l>x   +   AI s   [4] where A   is   the geometric inductance of the ring   and   Is   is   the super- conducting diamagnetic screening current flowing in the ring. The magnetic energy storage in the ring   is   just:  W n   =   AI;/2  so from [4]:  W n   =   (n<l>o   -   <l>x)2/2A [5] [6]

As can be seen from Figure   7.1,   the energies   En(<I>x)   are a set   of   inter- secting,   but   non-connecting, parabolas. Since for a thick ring there exists   no   mechanism   for   coupling   different   iz   states   together,   no transitions can occur between   these parabolas, even   at   the   points where they cross one another. The situation changes radically when a weak link   is   included in the ring.   In   this case two limiting regimes can be   discerned,   depending   on   the   strength   of   the   coupling   between integer flux states provided by the weak link.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   125  The   flux   mode   regime   -   weak   coupling   between nearest-neighbour   flux   states   of   a   superconducting weak   link   ring  It   is   convenient to consider a thick superconducting ring incorporating a   weak   link constriction as   an   inductor A enclosing a   weak   link capacitor   C,   as shown in Figure 7.2(a).   In   this model it   is   assumed   that charge   can   move   through   the weak link in integer units   of   q   =   2e   and flux   can   move across the weak link in integer units   of   <1>0'   both   pro- cesses being   quantum   mechanical in nature.   For   this weak link ring treated   as   a   single   macroscopic   quantum   object,   the   canonically conjugate variables are the magnetic flux   <I>   threading through the ring   and   c<i>,   effectively the charge   at   the weak link   11.

Let us again consider the thick superconducting ring. Here, the flux is extremely well defined   and   localised   at   discrete values   of  n<l>o.   To   see what has happened to the charge   we   can imagine making a cut across the ring   of   infinitely   narrow   section (Figure 7.2(b)) such that   C   ---.   00.   It   follows   that   charge   on   either side of this cut must be ill-defined   since   quantum-mechanical   pair   transfer   processes (0,   Â±   q,   Â±   2q   ...   Â±   Nq)   can occur across the cut up to extremely high order   in   N.   This   is   equivalent to saying   that   macroscopic screening supercurrents can flow in the ring.

Clark  <1>0   =   h/2e   will only be observed in circumstances where charge   can   be completely delocalised   around   the ring;   that   is, for the case   of   the thick superconducting ring.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   127  In   Figure 7.3(a)   we   show the ground-state energy, periodic in   <1>0' as   a   function   of   <l>x'   computed   using   a   small   value   of   Q   (hQ  =   0.05<1>6/   A).   As   can be seen, the introduction of a weak link into the ring creates a splitting   at   the crossing points   of   the energy parabolas in Figure   7.1.   It   can   also be seen   that   for small   Q   coupling between adjacent flux states is only   important   close to the maxima in   E   versus  <l>x,   at   which points   an   amplitude superposition (e.g.   n<l>o   ~   (n   +   1 )<1>0) exists   between   these   macroscopically different   quantum-mechanical states   of   the ring.   In   anyone   of   the almost parabolic sections between these maxima the flux state   of   the weak link ring   is   rather   well defined and   localised   about   a particular value   of   n<l>o.   As   implied by [9], this requires   that   the   weak   link constriction   is   large enough in   cross- section   to   accommodate   a   macroscopic   screening current;   that   is, quantum-mechanical   pair-charge   transfer   processes   Â± N   q   can   take place through the weak link   up   to very high   order   in   N.   This   is   de- monstrated   very clearly in Figure 7.3(b), where the screening super- current   Â«   Is   >   = -   dE(<I>x)/d<l>x)   is   plotted as a function   of   the ex- ternal applied flux   <I> x,   as calculated from   the ground-state energy  E(<I>x)   of Figure 7.3(a). The screening current response   Is(<I>x)'   shown in Figure 7.3(b), is necessarily the sum of harmonics   12   such that: 00  Is(<I>x)   = -   dE(<I>x)/d<l>x   =   L   1 m   sin   (2nm<l>x/<I>o)  m=l  [11] In   terms of the uncertainty relation [9], if the flux threading the ring inductor   is   relatively well defined   about   discrete values   of   n<l>o,   the charge   on   the weak link capacitor must be a superposition   of   a large number of integer pair-charge states. This   is   clearly   not   in the limit of weak link behaviour, as defined by Josephson   8,   where only nearest- neighbour superpositions   (Nq   ~   (N   Â±   1)q)   are considered.   In   the 'flux mode' limit (small   Q,   n<l>o   ---.   (n   Â±   1)<1>0   couplings)   we   can therefore treat the charge   Q   as continuous (i.e.   no   longer discrete)   and   write a wave function in terms   of   an   angular displacement   0   =   2nQ/q   as:  \11(0)   =   LDne-   inlJ  n  [12] which, from   [1],   yields for   the ground-state energy a   Schrodinger equation   of   the form: (1   /2A   ) [i<l>o(   v / vO)   -   <I> x]   2 \II( 0)   -   hQ cos   0\11 ( 0)   =   E( <I> x)\II(   0)   [13J We note, first,   that   [13J   is   not   the Schrodinger equation, based   on   the Josephson definition   of   weak link behaviour, which has been used previously to calculate the properties   of   weak link rings operating in the flux mode regime   10,   and, second,   that   [13J contains   just   one cosine in the potential.

If the effective capacitance of the weak link   is   C then these oscillator modes are created   at   a frequency: [14] Thus, neglecting the zero-point energy,   we   can introduce a new energy (from [6]): [15] If,   in the flux-mode limit, flux can move in   or   out   of the ring in units of   <1>0   while   at   the same time the   photon   number can change from   m  to   m',   with coupling   C mm   "   the matrix equation for all possible nearest- neighbour flux-state couplings now becomes: where: min{m.m'}  C mm   ,   =   L   (m!m'!)t [r!(m   -   r)!(m'   -   r)!]-lA(m+m'-2r)   [17] r=O A   is   a dimensionless parameter,   and   the combinatorial factors arise because photons are identical bosons. The energies calculated from [16] form a set of bands in   <l>x   space, with periodicity   <1>0   and   band   number   K.   It   can be seen   that   nand   m  are no longer good   quantum   numbers   and   are replaced as such by the   band   number   K.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   129  the macroscopic level, the actual experimental techniques required to make such an observation have turned out to be very demanding in terms of electronic technology. The principal technical problem   is   easy to appreciate. We are dealing with an electronic device, the weak-link ring, which displays quantised energy levels with separations of a   few hundred   GHz.   In   order to   probe   this energy level   structure elec- tronically the measurement system   (i.e.   the electronics external to the weak link ring) noise temperature must be reduced to   ""   few   K over a large   band-width   (nominally   DC   to   10   12   Hz).   Fortunately,   with modern liquid-helium cooled electronics, based   on   gallium arsenide (GaAs) devices, this   is   now a perfectly practicable proposition.

The experimental techniques   we   have devised to look   at   flux-space band structure do   not   require transitions to be made between bands. Instead,   we   have been able to use very low energy methods which allow us, in effect, to monitor the first and second derivatives of a particular band energy as a function of   <l>x,   while the weak link ring remains in this band. This can be achieved because the   quantum   object (the weak link ring) can be made larger   than   the measurement ap- paratus to which it   is   coupled. In this section   we   describe a quasi- static technique which allows us to monitor the in-band magnetic susceptibility   X,,(<I>x)'   proportional   to   the   second   derivative d 2   E,,(<I>x)/d<I>;   of the   band   energy.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   131  receiver consists   of   a chain of three   UHF   amplifiers, operating   at temperatures   of   4.2 K,   77   K   and   room   temperature   (~300   K), re- spectively.   Each   amplifier   has   electronically-adjustable   matching networks,   incorporating   GaAs   varactor   diodes,   on   the   input   and output. The power gain   and   approximate in-band noise temperature of each amplifier stage   is   given in Figure   7.5.   As   can be seen,   UHF circulators are provided for in-band isolation (40 dB) between the second-   and   third-stage amplifiers   and   the third-stage amplifier   and the   UHF   mixer.   Broad-band   attenuation   is provided between each amplifier stage (not shown)   and   between the third-stage amplifier   and the mixer. Very careful attention   is   paid in this receiver system to properly terminating, in a   broad-band   sense, the   output   terminal   of the mixer.   Without   due care being taken over this detail,   we   find   that the noise temperature of the receiver can easily increase by   an   order of magnitude.   In   addition,   we   arrange for   both   the cryogenically- cooled   and   room-temperature   receiver   electronics   to   be   extremely well-shielded electromagnetically, effectively   from",   1   Hz   upwards.   As a further precaution against unwanted external noise being injected into the   tank   circuit (and hence the weak-link ring), all active devices used in the receiver system (e.g. GaAs   FETs   and   GaAs diodes) are powered by very-low-noise FET-based power supplies, operated from car batter- ies. This combination   of   broad-band   (roughly a   few   MHz   to   >   3   GHz) reverse   isolation,   very-low-noise   amplifiers   and   effective   electro- magnetic shielding   and   power-supply noise-reduction techniques leads to   an   all-up   broad-band   receiver-noise temperature   at   the   tank   circuit of   approximately a   few   K.   In   practice this receiver-noise temperature is   only maintained if   we   use   an   extremely stable   UHF   local oscillator, with a   few   parts   in   10 10   frequency stability. The   experimental   method   used   by   us   to   monitor   the   magnetic susceptibility   X"   of the weak link ring   is   very simple. We adjust all the matching stages   and   GaAs   FET   gate-bias voltages in the   UHF   ampli- fier chain for minimum noise temperature. We then plot the mean- square   noise   voltage   <1~VtI2>   developed   in   the   tank   circuit   as   a function   of   a very-slowly-varying external applied flux,   <D   xDC   .   Typi- cally, this flux will increase (or decrease) by one flux   quantum   over a time scale   of   10   to 30 seconds. The UHF-receiver   output   is   displayed in a small bandwidth   (DC   to a   few   Hz)   on   a   standard   X-versus-time plotter. Susceptibility patterns extending over   10   to 20   <Do   of   external bias   flux,   both   positive   and   negative,   are   then   plotted   over   time periods   of   up   to   10   minutes. In   Figures 7.6(a), 7.6(b)   and   7.6(c)   we   show noise-voltage   data   for the   ground   state   and   first   and   second excited-state bands   (K   =   1,   2 and   3)   taken using a niobium point-contact weak link constriction ring   9,10.   As   <D   xDC   is   changed it can be seen   that   these susceptibility patterns, which are observed   on   a larger static noise-voltage back- ground, repeat themselves with   <1>0   periodicity. Experimentally, these

            Macroscopic quantum objects   133  susceptibility patterns display   no   hysteresis;   that   is,   when   <l>XDC   is reversed, even over large ranges in bias flux,   these patterns super- impose up themselves. This must be the case if the weak link ring   is maintaining itself in a single band. Within the practical limitations imposed by   our   existing   UHF   receiver system,   we   find that the weak link ring can remain stably in a particular   band   for a period as long as   10   minutes, although this time may be much shorter   C"-I30   seconds). A transition   is   then made   to   an   adjacent band. We assume   that   such transitions are caused by the absorption   or   emission   of   millimetre wave photons   of   energy comparable to the separation between the low-lying weak link ring bands   (~hwc).   Even with all the care   we   have taken' in shielding, isolation   and   low-noise amplification, and- given the   poor   coupling configuration   of   the weak link ring to millimetre- wave radiation, the stability   of   the ring in these first   few   energy bands is   remarkable. In   Figures 7.7(a), 7.7(b)   and   7.7(c)   we   show the theoretical best-fit band-susceptibility patterns for the ground state   and   first two excited states   of   the   ring.   This   best   fit   is   achieved   for   hQ   =   0.05<1>~/   A,  hwc   =   0.078<1>~/   A   and   A   =   0.5. The energy bands corresponding to the magnetic susceptibilities   of   Figur~   7.7   have already been presented in Figure   7.4.   The correspondence between the experimental   and   theor- etical susceptibility patterns   is   striking. We note   that   quite substantial changes in   A(0.5   Â±   0.2) have little effect   on   the theoretical suscepti- bility patterns   of   Figure   7.7   For   each pattern   hW   R   ~   hQ   and   hw   c   which means   that   we   can observe the ring in one   of   its eigenstates without causing a transition between states. This   is   a direct consequence of the essential measurement apparatus;   that   is,   the   tank   circuit, being smaller   than   the   quantum   object, the weak link ring. In a practical arrangement the tank-circuit coil inductor   is   actually placed inside the weak link ring   13.   As   far as   we   are aware, this non-invasive probing of   a single-quantum mechanical object by a macroscopic   apparatus constitutes a radical departure from conventional approaches to the problem of measurement in   quantum   systems. In this context it   is apparent from the susceptibility patterns of Figure   7.6   that, using non- invasive measurement techniques, it   is   perfectly practicable to observe a   macroscopic   quantum   object   in   an   amplitude   superposition   of macroscopically different states.   For   the case   of   the weak link ring of Figure   7.6,   these macroscopically different states are the quantised magnetic-flux states which   we   deliberately   do   not   choose to measure. This, therefore, provides one experimental retort to the often-posed paradox   of Schrodinger's   cat   14,   although,   of   course,   a   supercon- ducting weak link ring   is   an   extraordinarily coherent object compared with a room-temperature cat.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   135  Observation   of   the   flux-space   band   structure   of   a   weak link   ring   -   dynamical   method  The   circuit shown as a block   diagram   in Figure   7.5   can   form the basis for a   particular   version   of   the well-known AC-biased superconducting quantum   interference   device   (SQUID)   magnetometer   13.   The   only requirements for   turning   this system   into   a   SQUID   magnetometer are, first,   that   a high-frequency (AC)   current   lIN   be injected   into   the tank   circuit from   an   external   current   source and, second,   that   this current   source be frequency-   and   phase-locked   to   the local oscillator source. AC in this context is generally   taken   to   mean   a frequency range from a   few   MHz   to   roughly 0.5   GHz.   The   system now operates as a phase-sensitive detector   (PSD)   at   the frequency   of   the AC input. The   response   of   the coupled weak link ring-tank circuit   combination to   the injected   current   lIN   is   monitored   via   the   AC voltage V OUT   de- veloped across the   tank   circuit.   In   a   PSD   SQUID   magnetometer   the phase difference between V OUT   and   lIN   can   be adjusted by means   of   an AC   phase shifter   incorporated   into   the local   oscillator   arm   of   the system.   In   simple AC-biased   SQUID   magnetometers   the   PSD   system is dispensed with   and   the amplified   SQUID   signal V OUT   is displayed directly after diode detection   15,16. When   a high-frequency   current   is   injected   into   the   tank   circuit a high-frequency magnetic flux is generated in the tank-circuit coil. This flux couples   to   the weak link ring, which in response sets   up   a cir- culating screening supercurrent.   If   we   know   the form   of   this screening current,   that   is, its dependence   on   the external flux with the weak link ring in a   particular   energy   band,   it is possible   to   calculate   quantum mechanically the dynamical   (V OUT   versus   lIN)   characteristics   of   the ring-tank   circuit combination. This requires   that   the   current   lIN   be amplitude-modulated   so   that   its   peak   amplitude   increases   linearly with time.   In   a practical   magnetometer   lIN   cannot   increase   without limit, so a   triangular   amplitude   modulation   is invariably adopted.   The frequency   of   this   amplitude   modulation   is always   kept   very   small compared   with the AC carrier frequency. To   take one example, the   quantum-mechanical   expression for the rf cycle average in-phase   V OUT   versus   lIN   characteristic   (V OUT   at   zero phase with respect   to   lIN)   with the ring   operating   in a single-flux   mode band   (0   small)   is   given by   17: VouT(in phase)   =   QwRLt[IIN   sin   2   <5   +   ;J~"d'   cos   '<I.(<I>~0t,   0)]   [23] where   Is   is   the <l>x-dependent screening   current   in a given flux   mode band,   Q   is   the   quality   factor   of   the   unloaded   tank   circuit,   and  J.1   =   Mts/L   p   For   a   static   applied   flux   <l>xDC   and   an   AC   flux   <l>XAC coupled   to   the ring, the   argument   of   the screening   current   <Is>   is

In Figures 7.9(a)   and   7.9(b)   we   show experimental lowest   band   in phase   V OUT   versus   lIN   characteristics for   an   ultra-low-noise   SQUID magnetometer, operating   at   430 MHz, with   an   amplifier chain fre- quency bandwidth   of   50 MHz,   and   based   on   the circuit of Figure   7.5. This magnetometer uses a niobium point-contact constriction weak- link ring   13,15   which   is   maintained   at   a helium   bath   temperature of 4.2   K. The effect   of   changing the   DC   bias flux from   n<llo   (Figure 7.9(a)) to   (n   +   !)<Il o   (Figure 7.9(b))   is: 1   to   invert   the   triangular   features   in   the   characteristic; and 2   to create a cusp feature in   V OUT   at   the current origin following closely the theoretical characteristics   of   Figure   7.8. Although the features displayed in the   V OUT   versus   liN   characteristics of this very high performance magnetometer are roughly triangular in shape, as   is   to be expected if the flux transitions in the weak-link ring   take   place   quantum   mechanically,   the   more familiar   SQUID 'steps' are easily recovered   18.   This can be achieved in two ways. First, if the frequency   bandwidth   of   the   UHF   SQUID   electronics   is   re- stricted sufficiently, the higher harmonics associated with the trian- gular features are lost   and   all that can be seen experimentally are positively-sloped   steps.   Second,   if noise   of   sufficient   amplitude   is injected into the tank circuit the triangular features are again washed out   into steps. This arises because, from   an   electrical-circuit model viewpoint, these noise fluctuations create jitter in the times   at   which flux transitions occur in any particular cycle   of   the externally gen- erated   AC   flux   19.   It   is   noteworthy   that   within   the   quasi-classical treatment of the AC-biased   SQUID   magnetometer, where   quantum mechanical   flux   transition processes are   not   taken into account, the concept of a shunt resistor   R,   in parallel with the weak link super- current channel, has to be introduced in order to generate these step features   20,21.   Thus, in this treatment the dynamical behaviour of the weak link ring   is   described in terms of a quasi-classical non-linear equation of motion: [24] where the potential   is: [25]  Ie   is   the 'critical current'   of   the weak link (that   is,   the current required to drive the link normal)   and   <Il   is   the included flux in the ring.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   139  The resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model, where the shunt re- sistor   R   acts as a Nyquist noise source, has played a very important role in the development of weak link physics   22.   However, from the viewpoint of weak link rings, this electrical-circuit model really only parameterises   the   limitations   in   the   performance   of   the   SQUID magnetometer electronic system. The normal dissipation occurs in the finite Q-tank circuit   and   this   is   included in the   quantum   mech- anical   expression   [23]   for   the   magnetometer   V OUT   versus   lIN  characteristic. It   is   worth comparing the lowest-band dynamical characteristics of Figure   7.9   with the experimental susceptibility patterns of Figure   7.6. Again,   we   are making a radically different kind of measurement   on   a single-quantum object simply because this object   is   larger than the classical circuit measurement apparatus. In this dynamical experiment we   monitor the screening current in the weak link. We do not,   at   any time, make a measurement to decide which macroscopically different flux state the ring   is   in.   What   we   are seeing in both the   SQUID magnetometer   and   susceptibility experiments   is   the effect of a macro- scopic   quantum   object   on   a classical measurement apparatus while this object - the weak link ring - remains in   an   eigenstate of the system.  The   charge   mode   regime   -   coupling   between   all possible   flux   states   of   a   superconducting   weak   link ring  We have seen that it   is   possible to incorporate a weak link in a thick superconducting ring so that, to lowest order, quantum transitions are   only   made   between   nearest-neighbour   flux   states   of the   ring [n<1l   o   -+   (n   Â±   1)<1l   o ].   This requires   that   macroscopic screening currents should be able to flow   around   the ring and, as   we   have pointed out, this cannot correspond to the Josephson limit   of   weak link behaviour. We now consider the conjugate mode   of   a superconducting weak link ring, where the link   is   small enough in cross-section to couple all possible   flux   states   of   the   ring   together;   that   is,   couplings n<1l   o   -+   (n,   Â±   1,   Â±   2,   Â±   3   ...   )<1l   o   are allowed up to very high order in the number of flux   quanta   transferred. The ring   is   now in   an   amp- litude superposition   of   all possible flux states so that the flux in the ring   is   extremely ill-defined.   From   the uncertainty relation [9] this implies that charge, in units of   q   =   2e,   should become well defined (localised)   at   the weak link. This limit, which   we   shall term the 'charge mode', constitutes the macroscopic quantum-mechanical state   of   a weak link ring conjugate to the flux mode described by the matrix equations [10]   and   [13].   By   comparison with the quantised flux states of a superconducting ring,   we   can imagine the weak link capacitor possessing instantaneous polarisation states of different integer   (N)q

If   we   assume 1   to lowest order, only   weak   nearest   neighbour   Nq   ---+   (N   Â±   l)q  coupling between the localised pair-charge states   on   the weak link capacitor need be considered; 2   an amplitude   AN   for the weak link to be in the   Nqth   polarisation state; 3   a quantum-mechanical transition frequency between these polar- isation states   of   v 14n;   and 4   an energy storage   on   the weak link capacitor   of:  W   N   =   Q;ot/   2C  where: Qtot   =   N   q   -   c<i>x =   N   q   +   Qx  [26] [27] Given   that   Qx   is the displacement charge   on   the capacitor, so that: [28] then the matrix equation for all nearest-neighbour couplings   is   just: [29] For   relatively small values   of   hv   (compared with   q   2   /c),   equation [29] yields a ground-state 'charge band' in displacement charge   (Qx)   an- alogous to the flux-space   ($x)   ground-state   band   of Figure 7.3(a)   23,24. This ground-state charge band, calculated from [29] for   hv   =   0.05 q   2   I C, is   shown in Figure 7.10(a). The screening voltage for this band, defined as: [30] with electric susceptibility: [31] is   shown in Figure 7.10(b). By   analogy with the screening current in the flux mode (equation [llJ),   the screening voltage response   on   the weak link capacitor, due to an externally generated   Qx'   is   the sum of harmonics: as   is   obvious from Figure 7.10(b). Again, by analogy with [12J   and   [13J, in this charge mode limit (small   v,   Nq   ---+   (N   Â±   l)q   couplings)   we   can treat the flux   $   as continu-

            142   T.   D.   Clark  rewrite [34] explicitly in terms   of   flux, including a magnetic energy storage term and, again, with   Qx   =   0,   as   27   ,28: It   is   possible to solve [35] to yield energy levels   E,,(<I>x)'   K   =   1,2,3   ...   , and   magnetic susceptibilities: X"   = -   Ad 2   E,,(<I>x)/d<l>~  which correspond to the patterns shown in Figure 7.6, for a particular choice of   v   10   .   Now, from a   quantum   mechanical viewpoint [34],   and hence   [25],   can   only   be   arrived   at   by   assuming   an   amplitude superposition   of   all possible flux states   of   the ring;   that   is,   in the charge mode   or   the Josephson limit of weak link behaviour. This.'   is   a con- tradiction   in   terms   since   flux-mode   descriptions,   either   quantum mechanical (equations   [10]   and   [13])   or   quasi-classical (equations [24]   and   [25]) are concerned with the situation where the flux states of a weak link ring are relatively well-defined   about   the values   n<l>o (n   =   0,   Â±   1,   Â±   2   ...   etc.)   and   macroscopic screening supercurrents can flow   around   the   ring.   From   our   previous arguments a   better description of a flux-mode weak link ring should develop, starting with charge-mode equation [34], if   we   introduce higher harmonics into the potential.   Our   trial 'flux mode' Schrodinger equation then takes the form:  [ -   h 2   8 2   (<I>   -   <l>x)2   00   (21t   Yf <lÂ»J  2C   0<1>2   +   2A   -   h,,"5;t   v"   cos   ~   '1'(<1Â»   =  E(<I>x)'P(<IÂ»   [36]  We are now actively investigating solutions of [36].  Observation   of   the   charge   space   band   structure   of   a weak   link   ring -   dynamical   method  The   analogy   between   equations   [10]   and   [29],   which   yield,   re- spectively, the ground-state energy bands in external flux   and   dis- placement charge space, leads directly to   an   experimental method for investigating the charge-band behaviour of a weak link enclosed by a superconducting ring.   In   the charge-mode limit   we   can treat the ring simply as   an   inductive element to couple a time-dependent magnetic flux across the weak link. We can then use a   SQUID   magnetometer system as   we   have already described (Figure 7.5) to probe charge- band   behaviour dynamically. Assuming   that   the weak link   is   operating in a single charge mode band, the   quantum   mechanical expression for the rf cycle average in phase   V OUT   versus   lIN   characteristic   is   given  b y   17,29:

            Macroscopic quantum objects   143  Here,   L   t ,   Â£5,   OJ   R,   OJ r   and   j.l   have the same meanings as in [23].   The coupling coefficient is, as before:  K   ts   =   [M~/ALt]t  V   s   is   the Qx-dependent screening voltage in a given charge   band   (see [30]), with   an   argument:  Q~ot   = -   C[<i>x   +   j.l<i>XAC(()] where -   c<i>x   is   the static bias displacement charge corresponding to the magnetic flux   <l>x   in [23].   As   in this flux-mode dynamical expres- sion, the coupling   of   the   quantum   mechanical weak link ring   to   the dissipative external-circuit oscillator   mode   of   the   tank   circuit   is   taken into   account   rigorously in the charge-mode   equation   [37]. Examination   of   [23]   and   [37]   shows   that   a   scaling   factor   of  OJR<I>o:q/C   exists between the flux mode   and   the charge mode.

            146   T.   D. Clark  of   up to 1,000. The design   of   a SQ1JID electronics system, developed for charge-mode work,   is   shown in block form in Figure 7.11. This electronics   is   set up for diode detection   but   can   easily be rearranged to   become   a   phase-sensitive   system.   The   static   bias   displacement charge ( -   c<i>x)   is   provided by means   of   the 3   JIH   coil coupled to the weak link ring. In   Figure 7.12(a), (b)   and   (c)   we   show charge-mode characteristics for   Qx   =   -c<i>x   set   at   0,   q/4   and   q/2,   respectively   29,31.   The scale corresponding to flux   mode features   is   as indicated.   The   niobium point contact, set in a two-hole niobium block   15,   is   of   the usual mech- anically-stabilised   and   thermally-oxidised   variety   13.   The   actual adjustment   of   the point contact weak link is made   in   situ   in the cryo- stat   at   4.2 K. The weak link ring   is   coupled to   an   rf   tank   circuit   at 30 MHz. The   output   signal from this   tank   circuit   is   amplified   and then diode detected. This detection technique   is   well known to be noisy   13,30,31;   it also provides no phase information. The outcome   is that   the triangular features predicted by [37] are washed   out   into steps   19,31.   Even so, knowing the inductance   (3   JIH) of the static-bias displacement-charge coil   and   the amplitude   and   modulation frequency of   the current   input   to this coil,   we   can estimate the capacitance C   of the weak link   29,31,   provided the charge mode periodicity in   Qx   space is   q   =   2e.   For   a range of input current modulation frequencies   we find   C (average)   =   1.1   x 10-   15   F. We have used this technique,   at various cryostat temperatures, to determine the capacitance   of   a whole series of charge-mode limited point-contact weak link. We find capa- citances ranging from a   few   x 10-   16   F to a   few   x 10-   15   F. In   Figure 7.13(a)   we   provide one example   of   what can be achieved in terms   of   V OUT   versus   liN   charge-mode characteristics using a well- defined low-noise phase-sensitive detection system, again operating   at an   rf frequency   (w   R   /2n)   of   30 MHz,   but   this time   at   a cryostat tem- perature of   1.5   K. The characteristic shown corresponds to a static- bias displacement-charge   of.q/2.   In   Figure 7.13(b)   we   show the in- phase   V OUT   versus   liN   characteristic calculated from [37], assuming that   the weak link   is   operating in the ground-state charge band. Here,  Qx   =   q/2,   K;s   Q   =   1.58   and   hv   =   0.05 q 2/C,   as shown in Figure 7.10(a). The expression [37] predicts a spike   at   the origin of the   Qx   =   q/2  characteristic in Figure 7.13(b). This appears   not   to be resolved in Figure 7.13(a)   (cf.   Figure 7.9(b) for the   (n   +   !)<1>0   flux-mode character- istic)   but   the origin does move   up   and   down weakly   and   periodically on   the   V OUT   axis with changing   Qx.

            Macroscopic quantum objects   147  Charge-mode   effects   in a   normal   ring   containing   a superconducting   weak   link  Although   we   have chosen to consider the canonically conjugate roles of   magnetic flux   and   charge in a thick superconducting ring containing a weak link, this   quantum   mechanical description can be carried over to the case   of   a superconducting weak link enclosed in a normal metal ring. The concept still holds   that   for small enough cross sections flux can be transferred   quantum   mechanically back   and   forth across the weak link in units   of   Â±   <1>0'   Â±   2<1>0   ...   Â± n<l>o.   Thus equation [29J, which yields the ground-state charge-band energy,   is   not   dependent on   the   weak   link   being contained   within   a   superconducting   ring. Magnetic flux is still confined when the ring is normal,   at   least   on   a time scale short compared with the circuit time constant   of   the ring  (AIR,   where   R   is   the resistance   of   the normal section). We have started to investigate the rf behaviour of niobium point- contact weak links incorporated in normal copper rings. We find   that these hybrid rings, operated   at   frequencies between   17   and   30 MHz, display perfectly good   SQUID   charge mode V OUT   versus   lIN   character- istics which are split in the usual way by a static bias displacement charge   (Qx).   We have   not   observed flux   mode   behaviour in   these hybrid rings. The obvious difference between the normal copper   and superconducting niobium ring devices   is   that   for the former the   Qx-  bias   cannot   be   generated   by   currents   of   too   small   a   modulation frequency.   When   the inverse   of   this frequency becomes comparable with   AIR,   the time-dependent bias   flux<l>x,   which   is   required to generate  Qx,   simply leaks   out   through the copper ring   and   does   not   cut across the weak link. As   an   example   of   the behaviour   of   hybrid rings we show in Figure 7.14 the result   of   our   first   attempt   to   monitor   directly the ground- state charge   band   of   the superconducting niobium weak link. We plot the mean square noise voltage across the   tank   circuit coupled to the ring as a function   of   increasing bias displacement charge with   no   rf current drive applied   to   the   tank   circuit and, from [31 J, observe the second derivative   pattern   d 2   E(Qx)/dQ;   versus   Qx   with the weak link operating in the ground-state band. This   is   the charge mode analogue of   the   noise   spectroscopy   technique   used   to   plot   the   flux-mode magnetic susceptibility (d   2   E,,(<I>x)/d<l>;,   equation [19J, Figures 7.6   and 7.7) as a function   of   external applied flux   <l>x.   The susceptibility spikes in Figure 7.14, which were recorded using a linearly increasing   and decreasing (triangular modulation)   Qx   at   a frequency of 3 kHz, are somewhat truncated in height due   to   band-width limitations in the charge-mode receiver system.   Nevertheless, the power   of   the   noise spectroscopy technique   and   the correspondence between flux-mode   and charge-mode susceptibility   data   (Figure 7.6(a)   and   Figure 7.14) are obvious.

            8  Meaning   and   being   in contemporary   physics  Bernard d'Espagnat   Laboratoire   de   Physique Theorique et Particules Elementaires, Orsay, France  1   Introduction  Anybody   who   intends   to   ponder   on   the   foundations   of   contemporary physics   and   who   feels   a   need for   a   starting   point   should   read   in parallel   two   remarkable   recent articles   by   Wheeler   1   and   Bell   2.   No   ex- perience   can   show   more   clearly   than   this   the   fact   that   the   foundation problem   does   not   simply merge   into   what   we   normally   call physics. For,   in this   latter   field, we never get the impression   that   two   mutually incompatible   standpoints   are   both   valid, whereas this is   just   the   queer feeling   that   can   easily emerge from   the   experience in question. Indeed, although   the   contents   of   these   two   articles   are   mutually   exclusive, the articles themselves   are   so persuasive   that   we   must   think   hard   before we find   an   acceptable way   not   to   take   up   unreservedly -   at   the same time - the views expressed by   both   of   them. This   thinking   adventure   differs from   day-to-day   physical research also in the fact   that   it calls for   no   recourse   to   highbrow   mathematics or   to   long   sets   of   elaborate   formulae.   It   essentially consists in trying to   bring   some   more   light   into   the   question   of   the   implicit   views, assumptions, concepts   and   the like   that   tacitly underlie   our   way   of thinking   and   that   make   us agree in succession with the   arguments   of each article.   In   other   words   it   makes   us   aware   of   the   force   of   Einstein's assertion   that   what   is   most   basic in physics is   not   the   mathematics but   rather   the   set   of   the   underlying concepts. It   is   of   course clear   that   David   Bohm   ranks   first   among   the physi- cists   of   our   generation   who   illustrated   through   their   example   the deep   truth   of   Einstein's maxim.   Many   of   us -   including the present writer - were   awakened   from a   kind   of   'dogmatic   slumber'   (to   take   up 151

            152   Bernard d'Espagnat  Kant's words) by reading his 1952 papers. But most certainly (as his later work shows) Bohm would, more emphatically than anybody else, advise us not to   just   jump   from one dogma to another. This   is   why we   feel   entitled to dedicate to him the discussion presented here. In a way, the first of the quoted articles (although the developments of the present paper are inspired by the two authors quoted,   we   are quite far from giving here a mere transcription   of   what they assert; hence their responsibility   is   not   in the least involved in any statements given here which would be unpalatable to the reader) may be con- sidered as   an   explication of the main ideas of the Copenhagen group or, more precisely, of a way in which these ideas may be given manifest internal consistency.   As   is   well known, some of the most significant of these ideas were left in a not-completely-explicit   and   even somewhat ambiguous stage   by   their authors.   Moreover,   some   of   them   were obliterated to some extent by the considerable development of the quantum formalism. This   is   because this formalism was essentially rooted in Dirac's   and   von Neumann's works   and   laid therefore - compared to the Copenhagen views - a greater emphasis   on   the notion of a (microscopic)   quantum   state (or equivalently   on   that of a state preparation procedure)   and   correspondingly a smaller emphasis   on the consideration of the experimental conditions under which such and such a particular proposition (bearing   on   a physical system) can be tested. Because he neither shuns   nor   conceals behind general state- ments the most baffling consequences of the undiluted Copenhagen views, Wheeler gives us in his recent articles (and particularly in the one quoted) extremely valuable clues as to what the basic ideas are, on which the 'view in question should be anchored if   we   want them to be non-ambiguous   and   to constitute a fully self-consistent set. As   for the Bell article, it offers   both   a concise   and   extremely clear description of what requirements a theory of independent reality can reasonably be expected to fulfill   and   the basic outline   of   a   quantum field theory which, in line with Bohm's 1952 papers, actually satisfies them.   As   already stressed, Wheeler's and Bell's conceptions   and   con- clusions, as to 'what the world is' and as to   our   relationship with whatever may be called reality, are opposite   and   mutually exclusive. This, in a way,   is   fortunate because a challenge   is   thereby presented to us.   Each of these two articles should help us to discover what in the other one are the apparently obvious ideas that   we   too quickly took for granted. 2   A   view   of   Wheeler's   article  It   is   not the case that every physicist who considers himself as being a supporter of the Copenhagen views will necessarily agree with the content of Wheeler's article.   In the opinion of many among these

            Meaning   and   being   in   contemporary physics   153  scientists, the Copenhagen views are based   on   the assertion that the 'classical'   or   'macroscopic' objects   and   events exist in some absolute sense which   is   in no need   of   being defined. Indeed, trying to define it, or   even trying to speak   about   it, would (so they think) be idle talk.   Or if it   is   not, if such a task   is   not   entirely meaningless,   at   least it   is   one which, in their opinion, can   and   should be entirely left to the philo- sophers. They   then   claim   that   we   should   not   try   to speak   of   the quantum   objects by themselves   and   that   any valid description   of   the quantum   phenomena   must   be   anchored   on   the   notion   of   these obviously existing objects   and   events (and in particular   on   the two closely   related   notions   of   'complete   experimental   set   up'   and   of 'conditions   of   observation' so often appearing in Niels Bohr's works). Such a conception may conveniently be called macro-objectivism;   and we   may   then   assert   that   many   theoretical   physicists   identify   the Copenhagen view with a special case of macro-objectivism. Now, macro-objectivism   is   a view which works very well in practice but   which meets with conceptual difficulties   that   are actually quite serious. The most conspicuous   of   these   is   that   it seems unavoidable to consider macroscopic objects as ultimately composed   of   microscopic, i.e.   quantum, ones. And one   of   the notions which one was trying to discard, namely the notion   of   quantum   objects existing in some abso- lute   sense   independently   of   the   conditions   of observation,   seems thereby to be inescapably creeping back. Closely related with this diffi- culty   is   the one   that   macro-objectivism seems to require a rather sharp distinction to be made between classical   and   quantum   objects (and events), whereas physics proper does   not   seem really to give us any clue as to how such a distinction could be made objective in any sense that would be in harmony with the basic ideas   of,   precisely, macro-objectivism. Admittedly irreversibility has -   at   least as regards events -   been considered by many authors as   a   good candidate for playing the role   of   a criterion in   that   respect.   But, again, it seems difficult to define irreversibility in a way which would make no refer- ence whatsoever,   not   even   an   implicit one, to the limitations   of   the abilities   of   the community   of   observers.   In   fact, the proposals   that have been made along these lines   do   not   seem to comply with the requisites that, for consistency, a macro-objectivist must have in mind when he considers   an   'objective' macroscopic event. An alternative possibility, namely the idea   that   quantum   mechanics should only be an   approximate theory, remains open. But it   is   not   substantiated by any experimental fact   and   it would be quite a new thing if a mo- mentous scientific change were initiated neither by new findings   nor by new theoretical developments   but   just by considerations   that   can well be called philosophical   about   the nature of reality. Under   these conditions it seems   that   whoever wants to   ~remain  faithful' to the letter of the Copenhagen conception should preferably not   identify the latter with macro-objectivism. Moreover it seems   that

            154   Bernard d'Espagnat  he   will   thus   remain   closer   to   the   real   spIrIt   of the   Copenhagen founding fathers.   In   his   book   Physics   and   Philosophy,   Heisenberg, for instance, considers   that   a statement 'can be made objective' if   we   may consistently claim   that   its content does   not   depend   on   the conditions under which it can be verified.   And   when   he   then defines   several varieties of realism, he dismisses as meaningless any 'metaphysical realism' (this   is   the expression he used)   that   would   not   reduce either to what he calls practical realism   or   to what he calls 'dogmatic realism'; that   is,   to a conception asserting   that   most or, respectively, all of   our meaningful   statements   about   the   material   world   can   be   'made objective', in the sense   just   specified.   Now   what   is   most significant in this standpoint   of   Heisenberg   is   not   the distinction he makes between practical   and   dogmatic realisms (although this, of course,   is   important too).   It   is   the very fact, first,   that   this   author   does   define   what he calls objectivity   and   realism instead of considering   that   these are primary concepts and, second,   that   he defines them by referring to what can actually be done.   By   choosing to define these terms   and   to define them in this way, Heisenberg in fact makes   verification   the primary concept;   that   is,   he chooses as a primary concept in science one which basically refers   to   the actions   of   men.   This choice has implications which are in fact so momentous   that   most   of   the physicists who con- sider themselves as agreeing with the Copenhagen viewpoint seem somehow   not   to have   dared   taking them quite fully into account. This however   is   not   the case with   John   Wheeler.   In   Wheeler's   paper the ultimate referent   is   'meaning', a concept for which F011esdal's defi- nition 'Meaning   is   the   joint   product   of all the evidence   that   is   avail- able to those who communicate'   is   taken. Another key word of this paper   is   'phenomenon'. However let us   not   be abused by the fact   that in current scientific language the word 'phenomenon'   is   very often understood as   just   signifying a type of event taking place within a reality whose concept   is   tacitly understood as being   the   ultimate refer- ent. Wheeler's sentence   'no   phenomenon   is   a phenomenon until it   is   an observed phenomenon' very clearly dismisses this 'commonsense' view. Indeed his 'phenomena' should be understood in the etymological sense (which   is   also the one in which   Kant   used the word); namely, 'what   is observed   and   about   which   an   agreement gets established amongst the community of all people in their right mind'. It   is   important   to stress that   in Wheeler's   paper   there   is   no primary concept other   than   these two   (or   just   'meaning' if   we   consider   that   'phenomenon'   refers   to 'meaning').   In   particular,   we   shall   not   understand this article if   we consider   that   there   is   another   primary concept, namely 'reality', tacitly underlying it. The article in question makes no use of such a concept but   if it did there is no   doubt   that   reality would be defined relative to one of the aforenamed two concepts   or   to   both   - again, just as   is   the case in   Kant's   work. Consequently, Wheeler urges us   'to   abandon   for the foundation   of   existence a physics hardware located   "out   there"

There   is   no point in reviewing Wheeler's article further, except to notice   that   the   qualitative   ambiguities   and   difficulties   mentioned above are   of   course removed by such a drastic approach.   In   particular it   is   clear from the whole content   of   this   paper   that   its   author   does not   give any basic status to the concept   of   irreversibility. (He does mention the notion   of   an   'irreversible act   of   amplification' however, but   it seems   that   he considers it as a mere 'potential' phenomenon, unless   it   is   'put   to   use'   to   make   the   meaning.)   For   example,   the splitting   of   a uranium nucleus, though it is called irreversible, could be undone in principle.   It   then would   not   count   as a phenomenon. Indeed, if   we   are right, his way   of   solving the well-known   quantum riddle   'How   is   it possible   that   mere information   (that   is,   "software") should in some cases (e.g.   that   of the Schrodinger cat) modify the real state of macroscopic things (hardware)?'   is   as follows. He answers by just   denying to this postulated hardware any existence   of   its own. This way   of   solving the problem will be analysed   and   discussed in the next section. 3   A   dividing   line:   modal   logic   (necessity, cou   nterfactua   I   ity)  It   is   well   known   that   in   order   to make explicit   and   to formalize   our familiar (valid   or   invalid, this   is   another   question) way   of   thinking a number   of   logicians considered   that   they   had   to supplement 'ordinary' logic (and in particular its most elementary part, namely the propo- sitional calculus) by introducing the notions   of   'necessity'   and   of   'possi- bility', for which 'ordinary' logic has   no   symbol. This gave rise to the so-called   'modal   logic', the need   of   which, although it is questioned by some,   is   made plausible by the observation   that   in ordinary logic the relation 'if -   then' (called 'material implication', symbol   ~)   does   not  actually play the role it   is   intuitively expected to play.   For   example it does   not   make   it   possible   to   identify   the   definition   of   the   word  magnetic,   applied to some object   x,   to the sentence   'If   small iron specks are in the vicinity   of   x,   they get attracted', for according   to   ordinary formal logic this sentence is true, in particular, whenever it   is   the case that   no   small iron specks are in the vicinity   of   x,   whatever substance  x   is composed   of   ...   One   way   of   removing this difficulty (it   is   not   the only way,   se~   below) is obviously to introduce a new relation, called 'strict implication'   or   'entailment'   and   reading 'if -   then necessarily'. We   can   then define 'magnetic' -   and   more generally all the properties that   can be identified to dispositional terms (aptitudes) - by sentences of   the form   'If   small   iron   specks are in the vicinity   of   x,   then necessarily they are attracted.'

            156   Bernard d'Espagnat  Should all the properties   of   material objects be, in the last analysis, considered as 'dispositional terms'? This   is   a debatable point   but   it seems   that   the choice of a positive rather   than   a negative answer   is the   less   'metaphysical'   option   since,   at   least,   it   defines   properties through a reference to experience. Unquestionably -   and   this   is   par- ticularly obvious in   quantum   physics -   we   do   not   have any direct knowledge   that   an   object has   or   does   not   have a given property.   To gain such a knowledge   we   must make a measurement; so   that   it seems appropriate to identify a property of   an   object with   an   aptitude this object has of inducing a given definite result when subjected to a defi- nite test (measurement). This observation has the consequence   that   if we   choose the strict implication procedure for defining the disposi- tional terms, then it   is   the whole realm of all the properties of objects (including even their very existence)   that   must be defined this way. This   is   not   the proper place for describing the details   and   in par- ticular the formalism   of this method (see, for example, reference 3 and   the references given in reference   4).   Let it be mentioned however that, in order to define in a precise way the notion of strict implication, modal logic has to introduce the notion of 'possible situations' (or, as they are often called, 'possible worlds') differing from the actual situ- ation (or 'world'),   and   has to specify   that   the implication under study holds   not   only in the actual situation   but   also in all these possible situations. When applied to the definition of properties this method obviously implies   that   measurements which, actually, are   not   done, should be considered.   For   example, if it   is   asserted   that   a   photon   has some definite momentum   p,   because it has been so prepared, what   is meant, according to this method,   is   that   if a measurement (of the photon   momentum), which actually   is   not   made,   were   made with the help of some appropriate instrument (which   actually   is   not   present) it would give result   p.   For   that   reason the strict implications considered here may also be called 'counterfactual implications'. But one point should be stressed. We must specify what the set   is   of all the 'possible situations' used in the definition. Technically this set   is   sometimes called the 'sphere of accessibility' associated with the actual situation under study. Clearly a great many physically conceivable situations should not be included in it.   In   classical physics, for example, if   we   want to counter- factually define the fact for a system to have some given energy, quite obviously   we   must exclude from the corresponding sphere of accessi- bility all the conceivable physical situations in which the system in ques- tion interacts with other systems in such a way   that   its 'energy'   is   not definable. When - explicitly or, more often, implicitly -   we   try to apply this procedure of definition to   quantum   mechanics (see section 4 below), the restrictions   we   must impose   on   the sphere of accessibility are even more stringent (to avoid misunderstandings, let it be mentioned right away   that   the   thus-obtained   description   of   quantum   mechanics   is nevertheless nearer to von Neumann's   than   to Bohr's views).

            Meaning   and   being   in   contemporary physics   157  It   should be observed   that   the counterfactual implication method here   under   study   is   a   mere   explication   of   a   process   which   quite naturally   and   spontaneously takes place in   our   mind when   we   speak of properties   of   systems, including their very existence.   In   fact (and in this section this is the first point   we   want to make)   our   usual notion of   a reality 'existing   out   here'   is   essentially based   on   our   unconscious use   of   the counterfactual method.   My   car   really exists since, even when I lie in my bed   at   night, I   could   (though I   do   not) look through the window   and   see it   parked   in the street. Consequently   we   assert here that   counterfactuality   is   at   the   root   of   the (almost universally held) world-view   that   may be called 'physical realism'. Now   the second main point   we   want to make   is   that   the Copenhagen view   can   (and probably should) be understood as   not   making any use of counterfactual implications whatsoever,   and   that   Wheeler's   approach indeed makes no use,   not   even   an   implicit one,   of   the implications in question. The possibility   of   defining 'properties' without any resort to counterfactuality   is   technically known (to the epistemologists) as the 'partial definition' procedure.   For   brevity let us simply note here   that   if this alternative   is   chosen then, properly speaking, a system S may have property   A   only when the experimental set-up   is   such as to allow for a measurement of   A.   Otherwise the   sentence'S   has property   A'   is   'worse than   false', for it   is   simply meaningless. Although a   few   isolated sentences of the Copenhagen founding fathers seem to refer to a kind   of   macro- objectivism which, in turn, would tacitly refer to counterfactuality in the macroscopic domain, it remains true   that   in the microscopic domain,   at least, the method   of   partial definition   of   properties   is   actually the one which   is   in agreement with the   'hard   core' of the Copenhagen standpoint (and, in particular, with the substance of Bohr's reply to Einstein). It can be considered   that   in Wheeler's article - in which   no   sharp   distinction between these two domains   is   made   and   in which the notion of a hardware 'reality   out   here'   is   banned, as   we   saw -   even the physical properties of the macroscopic objects are supposed   to   be defined by this man-centred   method   (it   is   man   centred because in it the instruments can only be defined as the 'things'   that   serve to measure). At this stage   we   can   draw a provisional conclusion, which   is   that Wheeler's standpoint, although it   is   most baffling (except to   some followers   of Kant),   cannot   nevertheless   be   rejected   right   away   on technical grounds since a method (the partial definition procedure) does   indeed   exist   for   defining   properties   (and   therefore   for   doing physics) without having   to   rely conceptually   on   the pair counterfac- tuality-physical   realism.   Moreover   we   understand   somewhat   more precisely the   root   of   our   vague feeling   that   this conception   is   baffling. It lies in the fact   that   we   are   not   used to defining properties (and existence) by the partial definition method.   As   we   said, without being even aware   of   the fact,   we   always conceive of them as though they were defined by the counterfactual method.

            158   Bernard d'Espagnat  The best way   we   have of grasping how   and   to what extent a given conceptual   approach   removes   the   conceptual   difficulties   raised   by quantum   physics   is   to look   at   the way in which   the   approach   in question can help solve the central riddle of this physics, which - again - may be formulated as follows. While it   is   conceivable   that   a measurement may modify a small object, the idea   that   a measurement of the co-ordinates of the   moon   may grossly affect these co-ordinates should be avoided   at   all costs. Similarly   we   should avoid   at   all costs being trapped into the conclusion   that   the fact   of   ascertaining where the pointer   of   an   instrument lies (thus 'making a measurement' of this position, either with the naked eye   or   with some second instrument) may in some cases   'do   something' appreciable to this physical quan- tity. But in the Schrodinger cat   paradox   (in which, for simplicity,   we may replace the cat by a pointer) how   is   it possible to avoid the con- clusion in question?   How   is   it possible to remove the simple objection which reads 'After   we   look the pointer has a given definite position. Before   we   look it has not. Hence by looking   we   "do   something" to the pointer'? This   is   not   the   proper   place for discussIng whether   or   not   any of the   numerous   attempts   at   building   up   a   'quantum   measurement theory' succeeded in solving this riddle.   What   is of immediate interest to us   is   whether   and   how the two mutually exclusive views   adopted by Wheeler   and   Bell, respectively, succeed in doing so. Bell's view   is discussed below,   but   we   may right away make the qualitative remark that, since this   author   accepts the notion of 'hidden variables', his prospects of removing the difficulty seem   at   first sight to be quite good. At first sight,   on   the contrary, since Wheeler does   not   accept the 'hidden variables' notion, his prospect of removing the objection looks bad. But   we   claim the thesis can be upheld   that   this   is   just   an   appearance. Again, the objection seems insuperable to us because, without being even aware of the fact,   we   systematically think in terms of a counter- factually-defined reality (here the reality   of   the wave function;   that   is, the reality of the state in which   the object-plus-pointer composite system was prepared   or   happened to be). If   we   are really willing to take the   major   conceptual step   that   the Copenhagen founding fathers, somewhat ambiguously perhaps, invited us to take   and   that   Wheeler, frankly rejecting this ambiguity, explicitly claims   we   should   take -   that is,   if   we   give   up   altogether any idea of a knowable hardware reality existing   per se   out   here -   then the very basis of the objection dis- appears.   It   just   has no meaning to say, for example,   that   'before   we look the pointer has no definite position'.   To   understand why this   is so   we   may compare the complex situation under study with a simpler one.   For   example,   let   us   replace   the   whole   composite   system (measured   quantum   system   plus   apparatus)   by a spin one-half particle P   and   let us replace the fact of looking   at   the pointer by   that   of

            Remark  Meaning and being   in   contemporary physics   159  measuring its spin component   Sz.   In the case in which the preparation procedure consisted   in   passing   P   through   a   Stern-Gerlach   device directed   along   Ox,   we   then   normally   tend   to   say   that   before   the measurement P has   an   Sx   which has a definite value so that   Sz   can have no definite value   on   P. But actually, if   we   decide to define proper- ties exclusively by means   of   the partial definition method,   we   cannot even assert the premise since P   is   not   associated with   an   apparatus capable   of   measuring   Sx.   Be   it only for this reason,   we   then cannot derive from the axioms of   quantum   mechanics any falsification of the assertion that before the measurement   Sz   already has some definite but unknown value. Of   course, this argument can be carried over in a straightforward way to the actual problem under study. Hence   we   are right in asserting it   is   only the fact of the human mind spontaneously   not   following the partial definition method   and   tacitly thinking instead in terms of a counterfactually defined 'external reality' that gives to the objection under study the appearance of being valid. In fact it   is   not. Its validity is   restricted to the 'elementary' conceptual description   of   quantum mechanics   which   we   hinted   at   above,   and   which   counterfactually defines the state   of   the system before measurement. To repeat: if   we hold fast to the prescription of using exclusively the partial-definition procedure   we   cannot meaningfully say   that   we   'do something' to the pointer by looking   at   it (and   we   cannot say either that   we   are acting on the past by inducing it to 'have taken' a definite position when it interacted with the   quantum   system). This conclusion can also be reached by criticizing - in the objection under study - the use made of the phrase 'after   we   look, the pointer has a definite -position' for establishing the role of the observer as a cause. At least, this   is   true if   we   accept the definition of the (con- troversial) notion of cause which restricts its use to the case of events that,   although   they   may   just   happen   in   nature   without   any   in- volvement of man, nevertheless can   also   be induced by man's free   will. This definition   5   reads: 'If A   is   such   an   event and if it   is   the case that event B takes place (after   A)   in all the cases in which   we   made A to happen, and does not take place in the cases in which   we   refrained from doing so, then A   is   the cause of B.' To apply this definition to our   problem   we   must, of course, say   that   A   is   the fact   of   looking at the pointer. But what   is   B?   B (the effect) cannot be that the pointer co-ordinate takes a value within a given interval (say, between 4 and 5 on the scale) since it   is   not true that in all the cases in which   we   do look   we   observe that special result. Hence the effect can only be 'the pointer has   some   definite position' (by opposition to 'the pointer has a given definite position'). But in ordinary formal logic the sentence

            160   Bernard d'Espagnat  'the pointer has some definite position'   is   a mere tautology.   It   can acquire a non-tautological meaning only through a resort to modal logic (a V   a   is   a tautology   but   D   a V   D   a   is   not, where   D   a means 'necessarily a'). Hence in the approach considered here (no modal logic accepted) it   is   false to say that this sentence only became true when we   looked. Is it claimed here that Wheeler's approach removes all the conceptual difficulties   of quantum   physics? Certainly not.   In fact   the   present author, for one, pointed   out   6   that non-local indirect measurements of the   EPR   variety raise difficult questions in the partial definition ap- proach; and, more generally, Wheeler himself warns us that what he   is trying to do   is   mainly to indicate a direction,   and   that major diffi- culties still remain to be settled.   Our   purpose in this section   is   merely to point   out   the way in which, within the approach in question, a particular - but puzzling - question can be settled.  4   Some   comments   on   Bell's   views  Before leaving (for the time   being   at   least) Wheeler's article, it   is appropriate to mention a highly illuminating analogy therein con- tained. It consists in comparing the work of the scientific community to a very peculiar type of the well-known game of guessing a word by asking a group of friends questions such as 'Is it   an   animal?' 'Is it blue?', and so on. We say   'a   very peculiar type' because, in the analogy proposed by Wheeler, the friends of the guesser have decided not to choose a word in advance. Everyone could answer as he pleased, with the only proviso being that he had to have a word in mind compatible with all the previous answers.   As   Wheeler points out,   we   used to think of the electron as having a definite position, whether   we   observe it   or not, just as the guesser thinks the word exists in his friends' minds even before   he   starts asking questions. The analogy consists in the fact that both these ideas are wrong. And it   is   clear from the whole context - in the quoted article - that the analogy   is   supposed to hold just as well for a pointer position as for   an   electron position. In this analogy the guesser obviously corresponds to the scientist. But to what, may   we   ask, do the guesser's friends correspon,d? Wheeler answers: 'They play the role that "nature" does in the typical ex- periment.' Now, up to this point   we   were happy. We were somehow in the state of mind of a student who reads a textbook in mathematics   or physics; who grasps the transitions from one equation to the next; who sometimes, for better understanding, makes explicit for his own use some intermediate calculations   that   the writer left implicit; and who,   apart   from this, has no questions and no worry. But   now~   with this word 'nature' appearing just in this role which Wheeler assigns to

            Meaning and being   in   contemporary physics   161  it, suddenly a - highly non-technical   but   all the same highly worrying - question does appear.   For   is   not   physics the science of nature? Is it not   true   that   its aim is   to   try to know   at   least some features   of   nature itself? But then how   can   we   escape the following remark? The just- recalled analogy -   the fitness   of   which   we   do   not   question -   shows just   the   contrary.   It   shows   that,   if Wheeler   is   right,   the   scientist actually does no more increase his knowledge of   'nature'   than   the guesser increases his knowledge of his friends. They   both   build up a knowledge,   but   just   not   that   one. Does this objection destroy   our   previous opinion   that   Wheeler's argument   is   strong?   Not   at   all,   but   nevertheless,   and   particularly if   we recently read some of the very explicit statements (presumably inspired in   part   by David Bohm   and   at   least   consonant   with   important   ideas of the latter) contained in some of Bell's articles (see, for example, reference   7),   we   must be specially receptive to the objection in ques- tion; for in several of these texts Bell's views link   up   with those of Einstein in   that   they   both   consider   that   a satisfactory physical theory should tell us   about   what   is,   instead of endlessly playing with such concepts as observables, measurements, state   preparation   procedures, and   so on. In   a number of classical, very general, assertions of philosophy (such as 'ideas can only be related to ideas',   and   so on)   some may see grounds for   a priori   rejecting this requirement. But such arguments do   not   look binding since, as   we   saw, a technically respectable means - namely counterfactual implication - exists for defining the properties of   at   least the macroscopic objects (and their existence as well) in such a way that, although the definitions   do   involve man's experience, nevertheless   the   reality   of their described   union   may   without   any contradiction be considered as independent   of   man's mind. On   the   other   hand, as soon as this latter view (commonsense real- ism)   is   accepted as regards the macroscopic objects it   is,   as   we   saw, difficult to reject the requirement   that   it should be extended to physics in general. Indeed, so   natural   is   this requirement   that   most of the physicists   (including even   quantum   theorists)   who   have   not   given special attention to these problems implicitly believe   that   somehow it is   fulfilled as regards contemporary physics. If   we   try to follow these lines explicitly,   a priori   two possible ways seem to be open for   our   query.   One   of them   is   to try to dispense with supplementary (or 'hidden') variables; the other   is   not   to exclude the existence of the latter.   It   may be said   that   the first way   is   the one which   is   followed by most physicists (without them always being fully aware of it).   It   consist's (commonsense realism again) in systematically using the counterfactual implication method of definition, in extending it, therefore, also to the properties of the   quantum   systems,   and   in trying to avoid the well-known conceptual difficulties (two-slits ex- periment   and   so on) by restricting in some suitable way the relevant

Technically this   is   achieved by specifying   that the sphere   of   accessibility corresponding to (a given value of) a given property   of   the system does   not   include possible situations ('worlds') in which   an   instrument capable of measuring a quantity incompatible with the property in question   is   associated to the system. Practically, this way   of   thinking leads very directly to the view   that   the   quantum states (as described by state vectors) are 'physically real' in the sense explained in the foregoing section. The advantages of this conceptual   approach   (which   we   may call the conventional one, since it   is   in the minds   of   so many working phy- sicists)   lie   in   its   formal   simplicity   and   in   its   practical   efficiency. Nevertheless, its inconveniences are serious. First   of   all it should be noted   that   it does   not   entirely fulfill the Einstein-Bell requirement as defined above, since it defines a property by means   of   a sphere of accessibility, the specification   of   which incorporates the use of the man-centred concept of   an   instrument. But even if this special diffi- culty can be removed,   other   ones remain.   As   soon as the state vector is   considered as being 'physically real', the Schrodinger 'cat paradox' reappears. In a sense it may be said   that   the whole content of the so- called   'quantum   measurement theory' (or 'theories')   is   nothing   but   an effort to remove this paradox. But, as   we   briefly noted above, it seems that   the price these theories have to pay for success   is   always the same. It consists in making somewhere (preferably   at   some not-too- conspicuous place) some reference to the practical inability of man- kind   at   making   particularly   difficult   measurements.   Hence   these theories   cannot   be said to satisfy the Einstein-Bell requirement. Another inconvenience   of   the conceptual   approach   under study was pointed   out   by Aharonov   and   Albert   8.   These   authors   could show   that in   quantum   theory there exist   some   non-local physical quantities   that are measurable in principle,   at   least   "in   the restricted sense   that   it can be checked whether   or   not   the physical system under study   is   in   an eigenstate   of   the considered quantity. Moreover, the measurements in question   are   non-demolition measurements;   that   is,   they leave   the system in this state. They   can   thus be repeated as often as desired. The point then   is   that   we   can   monitor   such a non-local eigenstate (that   is,   we   can continuously check   that   the system still   is   in it) in any referential   we   choose.   Under   these   conditions   an   ordinary   local measurement of some   other   quantity pertaining to the system   cannot reduce the state other   than   on   the hyperplane defined by the time of this measurement in this chosen   referential (any other assumption would lead to a contradiction between two sets of predictions which are   both   verifiable in the referential in question). Hence the collapse of the   quantum   state   cannot   be considered as being a covariant pro- cess. This does   not   imply a violation of relativity conceived   of   as   an operational theory since, as several   authors   including the quoted ones have shown, relativistic causality   in   this sense   is   not   violated. However

            Meaning and being   in   contemporary physics   163  it would imply a violation   of   this same relativistic causality -   but   now conceived of in a realistic sense - if   we   were to assume   that   the non- local state under consideration   is   'physically real' (in the sense made precise by the counterfactual method)   and   is   reduced by the ordinary measurement considered above (the Everett approach, in which no collapse takes place,   is   thereby immune   to   this criticism). Now the necessity   of   reducing the state vector   upon   measurement has always been viewed as   an   unpleasant feature of the conception discussed here that   state vectors   of   micro-systems are, by themselves, elements of reality. But now   we   see   that   this necessity implies the existence of   an actual   contradiction   between such a conception   and   relativity, also understood in some realistic sense. We are therefore confronted, within this conception, with a difficulty which can no more be reduced to the status of a mere 'unpleasant feature'. A difficulty complementary to the one   just   described emerges if   we choose to remove the latter by   just   deciding   that   no state vector re- duction ever appears, for   we   then are led to one   or   other   of   the differ- ent versions of the Everett theory. And these versions all have features (such as superposition   of   macroscopically distinct states of conscious- ness, multiplication   of   universes   and   so on), the discussion of which must, for the sake   of   brevity, be omitted here   but   the acceptance of which   is,   at   any rate, a heavy price to pay for regained consistency. If   we   have all these difficulties   of   the conventional approach in mind, we   are well prepared to listen   to   Bell's assertion   that   'professional theoretical physicists ought to be able to   do   better',   and   to appreciate his proposal for doing so in the spirit   of   the de Broglie-Bohm version of non-relativistic   quantum   mechanics. This   is   of   course   not   the proper place for describing the thus-obtained theory. Let it   just   be mentioned that   it works   and   that   it   is   free from the following defects which   mar the conventional approach: necessity of dividing the world into two parts, 'system'   and   'instrument'; absence, in the mathematics,   of   any clue telling us what   is   'system'   and   what   is   'instrument'; and, correspond- ingly, the non-existence   of   any objective criterion distinguishing, among the natural processes, those which have the special status   of'measure- ments'. Moreover, the fact   that   theories of the de Broglie-Bohm type have supplementary variables (supplementary means, here, present in addition to the state vector) entails of course   that   the 'Schrodinger cat' paradox   is   far less acute there   than   in the conventional approach. In   its gross features   at   least, the objective state of the pointer was the same before   we   looked as it   is   after   we   did.  5   Veiled   reality?  The first of the conclusions to be derived from this comparison be- tween Wheeler's   and   Bell's approaches   is,   I think,   that   as regards self- consistency   and   definiteness   (absence   of   ambiguity)   both   are   far

            164   Bernard d'Espagnat  superior to what   we   called the 'conventional approach'.   Moreover, the foregoing analyses show   that   these superiorities stem from the fact that   the conventional   approach   applies ill-defined rules for specifying the cases in which counterfactual implication should be used in the definition   of   properties. By contrast,   both   Wheeler's   and   Bell's ap- proaches have clearcut prescriptions in   that   respect.   In   fact, Wheeler's answer   is   'never'   and   Bell's answer implicitly   is   'always,   unless   of course the alleged property under consideration   is   but   a secondary quality,   not   to be taken into account in the formulation   of   the basic rules of physics'.   In   his theory, many   of   the observables of ordinary quantum   mechanics are in fact reduced to this low status   of   secondary qualities,   but   the positions   of   the particles -   or, more precisely, the numbers of fermions   at   any point in space -   are not,   and   in the last analysis   we   must indeed consider   that   these quantities are there im- plicitly defined,   just   as in classical physics,   through   the counterfactual implication   method   (since,   at   any rate, it   is   clear they are   not   defined through the partial definition method). This is why   we   may say   that Bell's   approach   is   openly in agreement with physical realism, while Wheeler's   approach   is openly   not   (and the conventional   approach makes unsuccessful efforts   at   trying to make us believe it is). Shall   we   then choose between these two theories and, if so, which one of them will have   our   preference?   If   we were pure positivists (and if pure positivism could actually be consistently maintained, a hypo- thesis which now seems doubtful)   we   would have to choose Wheeler's, or, more precisely (but this specification   is   important),   we   would have to   choose Wheeler's   approach   while   at   the same time refraining, in our   comments   concerning   it,   from   any   allusion   to   what   he   calls 'nature'   in the   quotation   commented   on   above. This   is   because, as   we observed, the entity which he designates there by this name (the name 'independent reality'   would   be a   more precise one since the   word 'nature'   has many different interpretations)   cannot   be operationally defined   and   is in fact unknowable in his theory;   and   strict positivism has idealist connotations in   that   it instructs us to deny any meaning to such entities. Since Wheeler's allusion to this independent reality   is merely incidental   we   feel   we   would   not   thereby substantially deviate from   his views. Nevertheless, if   we   are neither pure positivists   nor pure idealists   we   can hardly dispense with the notion   of   a reality which somehow   is   more   than   just   a   'product'   of   man's mind. But, as already noted,   we   may then be seriously worried by the   unknowability of 'nature'   (of independent   reality)   in   Wheeler's   approach.   For   that reason   we   may,   at   first sight, be tempted to choose Bell's theory. However, along with their nice formal approaches, all the theories of this type also have well-known drawbacks.   One   of these   is   their lack   of   predictive   power   as   regards   original   experimental   results. Another,   and   probably more serious, one has to   do   with relativistic covariance   and   corresponds in fact to the Aharonov-Albert difficulty

            Meaning   and   being   in   contemporary physics   165  in the conventional approach.   As   Bell himself points out, although his theory   agrees   with   the   observable   predictions   of (operational)   re- lativity theory, 'it relies heavily   on   a particular division of spacetime into space   and   time', a fact   we   can express by saying that, in this theory, relativistic covariance has, for a realist, the low status of a mere   appearance.   Correlatively   it   implies   the   presence   of   non- observable   but   nevertheless existing non-local influences (non-separ- ability). Now,   an   important   point   is   that   such non-local features do   not constitute just a particular defect   of   this special theory,   of   which   we could hope other 'realistic' theories to be free. The well-known Bell theorem shows indeed   that   any theory which correctly reproduces some elementary (and experimentally well verified)   quantum   predic- tions   and   in which reality ('matter, things')   is   considered as being in spacetime (so   that   it views spacetime as existing independently of our- selves)   must   have the very peculiar non-local features   in question. These, however, are worrying in two respects. First, in spirit   at   least (not   in   the   equations),   they   somehow   run   counter   to   the   very assumption (of space   and   time embedding   of   reality)   on   which the theory   is   based. Indeed it would   se~m   that   the basic motivation for constructing a theory such as Bell's, in which the positions of things are considered as being 'more real'   than   anything else,   is   that   we   do observe things as occupying definite positions in space   and   that   we consider   our   theory will be simplest if it allows us to interpret this as corresponding to reality instead of   just   being   an   appearance. But then, the fact   that   in the theory under study: 1   we   find highly non-local influences   and   fields (in particular the 'beable'   It>   );   and 2   these influences   and   fields 'manage' to be completely   unobservable  except in highly sophisticated indirect ways; certainly constitutes   both   a surprise   and   a disappointment since, to a large extent, it re-introduces in the relationship between observation and   reality   that   very 'distance'   that   we   tried to suppress. And, of course - this   is   the second point - surprise   and   disappoint- ment are even amplified by the (related) fact   that   relativistic covariance is,   in this theory, just   an   appearance. For, again, it seems to be in the spirit   of   this approach to try to identify as much as possible appear- ances   and   reality (or, in a more philosophical language, phenomena and   reality) and,   at   this point, the result obtained   is   the contrary (some physicists   9   claim   they   can   reconcile   relativity   with   a   variety   of superluminal action   at   a distance   but   it   is   doubtful!   0   that the type of action they consider can account for the correlations observed in the EPR   experiments). Under these conditions, although   we   cannot disprove Bell's theory, we   may be justified in suspecting   that   after all there   is   perhaps a sign of some great   truth   in the mismatch between the   quantum   rules   and

            166   Bernard d'Espagnat  the notion   of   locality; a mismatch   that   keeps showing up in various aspects   of   physics. If this were the case, it would mean   that   we   are wrong when   we   believe the notions   we   have of space, of time, of spacetime,   of   the positions   of   things   and   of   events, are faithful de- scriptions   of   features possessed by independent reality. This   is   not   a view   that   I,   for one, would have taken   a priori.   In other words, methodologically I   am   not   a Kantian. But,   a posteriori,   I feel   somehow forced, by the foregoing analyses, to take up a stand- point, some features   of   which are   not   very far from some views ex- pressed by Kant.   More precisely, I think   we   should make a sharp distinction between empirical reality -   the set   of   the phenomena - and   independent reality. Empirical reality   is   all to which   we   have a strictly cognitive access.   Kant   would have said   'It   is   in space   and   time but   this   is   essentially because space   and   time are the ways   we   have of describing   our   experience.'   Modern   physicists tend to say instead   'It   is in   spacetime',   and   the   followers   of   Einstein   point   out   that,   since spacetime   is   not   an   a priori   mode   of   our   sensibility, the very fact   that physics forces us to this assertion shows   that   spacetime   is   real, quite independently from   us.   I   do   not   go as far as this. In view of the results of   the foregoing discussion I   feel   inclined to consider   that   even space- time   (and   locality,   and   events   and   so   on)   is   a   notion   that   owes much to the structure   of   our   mind   and   that   independent reality   is   in no way embedded in it. However, the argument   of   the Einsteinians remains impressive. Notions such as   that   of spacetime   and   everything that   goes with it are   not   primitive modes of thought. They therefore must have come to us from somewhere,   and   it   is   natural to think   that they reflect something   of   independent reality. But, again, in view   of the foregoing analyses, it seems   that   they reflect this 'something' in such a distorted way   that   it   is   impossible for mankind to reconstruct with full   clarity, from   such a   poor   information, what independent reality 'really is'.   In   short, independent reality   is   -   and   will remain - veiled to   us. Again, within this conception, empirical reality   is   all   that   is   scien- tifically   (i.e.   precisely) knowable.   Basically, it   is   what   our   present- day   quantum   physics describes for   us.   Now, if this   is   true, a question arises as   to   whether, within the realm   of   this empirical reality, which after all corresponds to the whole   of   our   scientific experience, such difficulties as the Schrodinger cat paradox, non-separability   and   the rest are   not   still present. If they are,   and   if they remain as acute as when the distinction between empirical   and   independent reality   is   not made, then this distinction should be considered as useless   and   there- fore as irrelevant. The answer to this last question   is   that   to some extent these diffi- culties are still there   but   that   they are   not   as acute as they were before. In its strict form, for example, non-separability   is   merely the assertion that the principle   of   separability   is   not   valid,   and   this principle cannot

            Meaning and being   in   contemporary physics   167  even be formulated in terms   of   empirical reality alone since it makes references to the 'objective states'   of   the systems. Within a description of   physics centred   on   the partial definition method it   is   replaced by a kind   of   indivisibility between system   and   instrument which   is   also non- local in some cases,   but   this non-locality   is   then hardly more surprising than   the very restriction   to   the partial definition   method   in which   we saw   that   a consistent description   of   empirical reality may be based. Similarly, as   we   saw, the central conceptual difficulty of   quantum physics, which   is   'How   can   we   avoid being forced to say   that   it   is   the observer, when he looks   at   the pointer, who fixes it   up   in one definite macro-state?', can be removed in principle   just   by giving   up   what   we called the 'conventional   approach'   and   its dual reference to the partial definition method   and   to the counterfactual implication method   of definition.   In   particular the difficulty disappears (at least as long as only local measurements are considered) in the   approach   (to which we   believe   that   Wheeler holds fast) which consists in defining proper- ties   and   states exclusively by means   of   the partial definition method and   which therefore allows no counterfactual interpretation whatso- ever to be given   of   the so-called 'initial state' of the system (or, in better words, of the state   preparation   procedure to which this system was subjected).   On   the   other   hand, as   we   said, the indirect, non-local measurements of the   EPR   type raise, in this approach, some problems of their own   6   that   can hardly be considered as being solved and   that could, therefore, create some   doubts   concerning the internal consis- tency   of   any 'physics   of   the phenomena'. This comes in addition to the difficulty   that   empirical reality   is   of   course the one   we   have to deal with   both   in scientific   and   ordinary   life.   Especially in ordinary life,   we   are so accustomed to think   of   macroscopic systems in terms   of the   counterfactually   defined   properties   they   have   that   we   find   it extraordinarily difficult to think   of   them   and   of their properties within the exclusive framework   of   the partial definition approach. It   is   at   this stage   that   I consider   that   the notion of independent reality (even of   an   unknowable one) may help   us.   For   example, al- though - for the above described reasons - I   do   not   'believe' in Bell's description of independent reality (in the sense   that   I would not swear it   is   true), I must observe   that   it   is   a contradiction-free model of what could conceivably be. And the mere existence of one such self-con- sistent possibility makes it clear   that   some (knowable   or   unknowable but   at   least contradiction-free) structures   of   independent reality may 'produce' the observed features of empirical reality so correctly pre- dicted   by   quantum   physics.   It   shows   therefore   that   the   meaning- centred approach   of   empirical reality   which   is   so characteristic of modern physics is,   at   least,   not   hopelessly inconsistent. But it shows this under the condition   that   empirical reality, even if it   is   final   for   us  - due to the limited powers   of   human   mind -   is   not   considered as the ultimate thing. This, I think, backs up my conception   that   a distinction

            168   Bernard d'Espagnat  between empirical reality   and   a knowable   or unkno\;vable   independent reality   is   relevant   11. To   those readers who would consider that this way of thinking   is too peculiar to be respectable, I would like to point   out   that   a some- what similar one was used a long time ago by Epicurus, when he tried to convince his contemporaries   that   the phenomena could be accounted for rationally, without referring to a pandemonium   of   deities   and   of good   and   evil spirits. At the time of Epicurus an enormous number of simple questions could not be answered scientifically   and   in the course of showing   that   deities were unnecessary Epicurus therefore had to point   out   that   we   must sometimes make specific hypotheses.   For   ex- ample, concerning the respective sizes   of   the earth   and   the sun   he advocated the choice of the more natural assumption, which   is   of course that the sun   is   smaller,   and   he stressed that, qualitatively   at least, it   is   possible to explain many phenomena this   way   without having recourse to the notions he did   not   like. Now, clearly he was too daring in putting forward the idea   that   the sun   is   smaller than the earth, as   we   might perhaps be too daring if   we   claimed that Bell's theory   is   correct. But   we   shall understand this philosopher somewhat better if   we   observe   that   the point he really wanted to make was just that   at   least one solution to his problem could be consistently thought to exist (my thanks are due to Miss Anne Richard for drawing my attention to this aspect   of   Epicurus' assertion). It   is   a similar idea I am trying to convey here. Let it be pointed   out   moreover that Epicu- rus' argument would be considered as correct even if a decision as to which one of the two heavenly bodies   is   larger finally turned out to lie outside human intellectual abilities, and that the analogy with what I have in mind concerning the present problem would then be even closer.

            9 Causal particle trajectories and the   interpretation   of   quantum mechanics  J.-P.   Vigier, C. Dewdney, P. R. Holland   and   A.   Kyprianidis   Institut Henri Poincare.  1   Introduction  The fundamental disagreement between   Bohr   and   Einstein   at   the 1927 Solvay conferences concerned   not   only the interpretation   of   quantum mechanics   but   also general philosophical orientations as to the nature of physical theory. Although these two aspects   of   the debate can never be fully separated, it is clear that, since   quantum   mechanics   is   after all a theory   about   the behaviour   of   matter, specific claims of the various interpretations can be more   or   less adequate in the face of experi- mental evidence,   and   even shown   to   be false in certain cases   1   ,2. In   relation   to   this   debate   perhaps   the   greatest   significance   and contribution of Bohm's causal interpretation of   quantum   mechanics   3 is   that   it   not   only exposes the arbitrary philosophical assumptions underlying   the   claims   of   the   Copenhagen   interpretation   but   also brings into relief the essentially new content   of   quantum   mechanics, which   is   reflected in different ways in Bohr's interpretation. Indeed the claim   that   the   quantum   formalism itself requires us   not   only to abandon   the quest for explanation of   quantum   phenomena   but   also the   concepts   of causality,   continuity   and   the   objective   reality   of individual micro-objects, is shown to be false. However the existence of the   single counter-interpretation proposed   by   Bohm constitutes sufficient grounds for   rejecting   the   absolute   and   final   necessity   of complementary   description   and   indeterminacy,   along   with   the   in- herent unanalysable   and   closed   nature   of   quantum   phenomena. This in itself was a   major   contribution,   but   further   than   this, since the possibility of alternative interpretations   is   not   ruled out, specific models may   be   proposed   which   allow   a   space-time description   of individual micro-events   and   the possibility of a deeper understanding, perhaps leading to   an   approach   which transcends current perceptions.  169

            170   J.-   P.   Vigier   et al. Although the causal interpretation has in effect been in existence since the very beginnings   of   quantum   mechanics, in the form of the pilot-wave model   proposed   by de   Broglie, it has   not   been widely adopted in the physics community, perhaps for reasons more ideo- logical   and   metaphysical   than   physical,   and   many people remain ignor- ant of it. In this contribution   we   wish to reconsider Bohm's interpretation in the light of recent developments   and   to   return to the question of the interpretation   of   quantum   mechanics.   In   particular   we   examine the adequacy   of   the   Copenhagen   interpretation   (CIQM),   the   causal stochastic interpretation (SIQM -   an   extension of Bohm's original approach)   and   the statistical interpretation in accounting for   quantum interference phenomena   and   quantum   statistics. We further demonstrate that the assumption   of   the existence of particle trajectories entails the elimination   of   negative probabilities from   quantum   mechanics. Such phenomena are at the heart   of   quantum   mechanics   and   inter- ference   experiments   were   crucial in   the early stages   of the   Bohr- Einstein debate, in   whi~h   the discussion was centred   on   the two-slit experiment.   In   fact they have become of central concern once again since   the   recent   neutron   interferometry   experiments   present   more strikingly the same puzzling behaviour,   and   offer wider possibilities to examine the adequacy of the various interpretations. However, let us consider first the three interpretations   of   the two-slit experiment.  2   Interpretation   and   the   two-slit   experiment  (i)   Bohr   and the   Copenhagen   interpretation  Although several versions of this approach to   quantum   mechanics exist, the most consistent and coherent version was formulated   by Bohr. 4   For   Bohr   science   is   only   possible   through   unambiguous communication   of   results. A necessary condition for this   is   that   a clear distinction be possible between subject   and   object (system   and   in- strument). The concepts   and   language of classical physics automatic- ally entail such a distinction and   we   have to communicate within its framework. If in any situation the subject/object distinction can be made   in   alternative   ways,   then   the   descriptions   arising   are   to   be termed   complementary   rather   than   simply   contradictory.   Bohr regarded complementarity as a general relationship evident in all areas of knowledge.   The   similarity   between   diverse   domains   regarding complementary description was not based   on   a more   or   less vague analogy,   but   on   a thorough investigation of the conditions for the proper use   of   our   conceptual means   of   expression. Complementarity, then,   is   not derived from   quantum   mechanics; it simply has a well- defined application in this area of knowledge where the existence   and indivisibility   of   the   quantum   of action implies the unanalysability of

The placing   of   the division between system   and   instrument becomes arbitrary   and   un- ambiguous   communication   impossible.   From   Bohr's   philosophical position the only possibility   is   to retreat to the classical description   of the results   of   experiments. Their classical nature   is   taken as given,   but then   quantum   phenomena become hermetically sealed. The funda- mental   unit   for   description   in   these   terms   is   then   the   whole 'phenomenon' constituted by the system   and   experimental   apparatus which together form   an   indivisible   and   unanalysable whole. Altering a   part   of   the   apparatus   in order to define more closely the   quantum process, by elucidating a conjugate quantity, simply produces a com- plementary phenomenon.   In   this view, 'There   is   no   quantum   world, there   is   only   an   abstract   quantum   physical description's. Quantum   mechanics only concerns the statistical prediction of the results   of   well-defined experiments   and   nothing more; it represents   an ultimate limit to   our   knowledge. The wave function   l/J   is   the most complete description   of   an   individual state; it   is   merely a probability amplitude which states the odds   on   various results   and   is   subject to instantaneous   changes   during   measurement.   If   some   preparation device (source, shutter, collimator)   is   designed   to   produce a   wave packet, then all   we   can say   is   that   the wave packet represents the fact that a single particle has a probability   of   appearing   at   a position   x  given by   1l/J(x)1   2 ,   if a measurement   is   made. Until such a time it   is   not legitimate even to conceive   of   a particle, let alone its properties. In   the specific case   of   the two-slit experiment (see Figure 9.1), what happens   between source   and   screen when interference   is   observed cannot   be described, even in principle.   In   fact the   quantum   system, detected   at   the plate, cannot even be said   to   have   an   existence in the usual sense. There   is   no   possibility   of   defining the process giving rise to the interference pattern.

Vigier   et al. description in terms   of   space-time co-ordination,   or   we   design   an   in- compatible   arrangement   to   determine   more   closely   the   space-time motion,   particle   properties,   and   forgo   the   possibility   of observing interference.   The   two are complementary phenomena. When   Einstein   6   proposed   a   gedanken   experiment   which   would enable the   path   of   the particle to be determined by measuring the momentum   it transfers to the slits,   Bohr   argued   that   if a screen   is   to be used in this way then its own   momentum   must be controlled with such a precision   that   by application   of   the uncertainty relations its position becomes uncertain by   an   amount   sufficient to destroy the interference.   It   is a curious fact   that   in   order   to arrive   at   this con- clusion   Bohr   must   assume   rectilinear   particle   trajectories   between source   and   slits   and   slits   and   screen.   The   quantum   object behaves classically   whereas   the   macroscopic   slit   system   behaves   quantum mechanically. Indeed, to be consistent it   must   be said   that   the screen actually has   no   position; its existence has become   Iofuzzy',   not   that   its definite position   is   just   unknown. Greenberger   7   has shown in detail how the interaction with such a   Iofuzzy'   object (in the   neutron   case) destroys the coherence   of   the overlapping wave functions. In proscribing the possible in   quantum   physical description,   Bohr has ruled   out   explanations in terms   of   determinate individual physical processes   taking   place   in   space   and   time.   This   is   not   the   task   of physics; the   quantum   theory   is   just   an   algorithm for predicting results and   its   theoretical entities need   no   interpretation.   In   this   way,   by epistemological re-definition,   Bohr   can   avoid all the   problems   and paradoxes   which   arise   when   an   attempt   is   made   to   provide   the formalism   and   its rules with a physical interpretation in terms of the behaviour of matter.   In   Bohr's   view   the   Ioobserver'   plays   no   more special a role in   quantum   mechanics   than   in any   other   area   of   know- ledge,   and   his   or   her consciousness   of   a given situation has   no   special effect. This   is   the core of Bohr's position   and   the unambiguous basis of   the   Copenhagen   interpretation.   Many   other   versions   of   the Copenhagen   interpretation   exist   and   these   have   led   to   extended discussions as a result of attempting   to   provide a physical,   or   psycho- physical, interpretation of the entities   and   laws of   quantum   mechanics, in terms of which the   phenomena   and   the interphenomena may be described   and   explained. These should really be distinguished from Bohr's position, which does not constitute a physical interpretation in the usual sense. In   the following   we   separate Bohr's position from those versions of CIQM   which   attempt   to interpret the formalism physically.  (ii)   The   statistical   interpretation  As   emphasized by Ballentine   8 ,   the statistical interpretation   is   to be distinguished from the   Copenhagen   interpretation.

            Causal particle trajectories   173  wave function simply represents   an   ensemble of similarly prepared systems   and   does   not   provide a complete description of   an   individual system:   'In   general,   quantum   theory predicts nothing which   is   relevant to a single measurement.'   8  The interpretation of a wave packet   is   that, although each particle has always a definite position   r,   each position   is   realized with relative frequency   1t/J(r)1   2   in   an   ensemble of similarly-prepared experiments.   It follows   that   each particle has a well-defined trajectory,   but   its speci- fication   is   beyond the statistical   quantum   theory; probabilities arising in the predictions   of   the theory are to be interpreted as in classical theory. In   the two-slit experiment this means   that   each particle in fact goes through one   or   other   of   the slits. Clearly the interference   of   particles is   something   new   in   quantum   theory   which   this   model   must   re- produce.   If   the particle goes   through   one   or   other   of   the slits, the two possibilities are in principle distinguishable;   we   should write a mixture instead   of   a pure state   and   the interference disappears.   In   order   to explain the persistence   of   interference in this interpretation Ballentine refers   to   the   work   of   Duane   9   in   1927,   more   recently   revived   by Lande   10   .   The result   is   obtained by considering the possibilities for momentum   transfer between the individual particle   and   the screen containing the slits. The   matter   distribution   of   the screen   is   Fourier analysed into a 'three-fold infinity of sinusoidal elementary lattices   of spacings   1 1 ,   '2'   1 3   â¢â¢â¢   and   amplitude   A(/J'.   According to   an   extension of the   Bohr-Sommerfeld   quantum   conditions,   each   such   lattice   is capable   of   changing its   momentum   in the direction   of   the periodicity only by amounts; The intensity of   an   I   component in the harmonic analysis   is   propor- tional to the statistical frequency   of   the corresponding   momentum transfer.   Thus   each particle does   not   simply interact locally with the screen   but   non-locally with the   matter   distribution   of   the screen as a whole.   Now   a change in this   matter   distribution, e.g. closing a slit, results in   an   instantaneous change in the components of the harmonic analysis   and   thus   in   a   corresponding change in   the   possible   mo- mentum transfers, resulting in a single-slit distribution of intensity. We are   bound   to ask what, in this analysis, determines which of all the possible   momentum   transfers actually occurs in   the individual particle's passage. There   is   no   answer   and   so individual events are inherently statistical. It   is   not   clear in this model why the   matter   distribution consisting the screen should be   Fourier   analysed   but   not   the   matter   distribution which constitutes the particle. The screen   is,   after all, made of particles. The physical status   of   the   Fourier   components which exist with certain amplitudes   is   also unclear. Einstein originally denied   that   the wave

            174   J.- P.   Vigier   et al. function gives a complete description of   an   individual because he saw that   this assumption contradicted the   notion   of locality   11.   If   we   assign the wave function only a meaning in a statistical ensemble   and   resort to the above arguments to explain interference   and   diffraction, then clearly non-locality is introduced,   but   in a way which   is   not   intuitively clear. If   we   reconsider Einstein's modification of the two-slit experiment in this model then   we   see   that   the meaning of the uncertainty in the position   of the   slits,   resulting in   the   loss   of interference,   is   to   be interpreted differently.   In   each experiment the screen has a definite position (this position has a statistical dispersion in the ensemble,   ~x)  and   so in each individual case the particle   is   forbidden to land in the positions of the minima of the pattern. (This incidently   is   a definite prediction   for   the   outcome   of   an   individual   experiment,   in   con- tradiction   to   Ballentine's   statement   above.)   However,   because   the position of the maxima   and   minima in each case is different, in the ensemble interference   is   lost -   a different explanation to   that   of the Copenhagen interpretation   but   with the same results. The statistical interpretation claims to be a minimal interpretation which removes the   'dead   wood'   of the Copenhagen interpretation. However, nothing is gained in the understanding of the   quantum   world and   the mysteries remain complete   ..  (iii)   The   causal   interpretation  This   interpretation   was   originally   proposed   by   de   Broglie   12   and independently by Bohm   3 .   It   has recently been extended by Vigier   13 to   include   a   sub-quantum   Dirac   ether   as   an   underlying   physical model. In   fact it   is   the only known interpretation   of   quantum   mechanics in terms of which all   quantum   effects can be explained   on   the basis   of causal continuous motions in space   and   time. The   quantum   mech- anical description   of   an   individual   through   the wave-function   is   held to be incomplete in the sense of Einstein. The description may be supplemented   with   real   physical   motions   of   particles,   without ambiguity   or   contradiction,   but   in a   manner   which introduces severely non-classical features. Bohr's epistemological position   is   set aside   and the task of physics   is   held to consist   not   only of the   attempt   to predict the statistical frequency of results in ensembles   but   also to provide explanations   and   descriptions   of the   individual   processes   between source   and   detection.   No   problems arise in the analysis of 'phenom- ena' into constituent parts, as the essential feature of their unity   is now manifested by the   quantum   potential which arises from the non- locally correlated stochastic fluctuations of the underlying covariant ether (see Introduction). The   quantum   potential exhibits radically new properties.   In   the single-particle case its form depends   on   the state of

Clearly if   we   consider   that   individual particles really exist in the interphenomena between source   and   screen   and   follow determinate trajectories,   then   the motion   of   each   particle must   be inextricably linked with the structure   of   its environment. Any change in the ap- paratus   affects   the   whole   ensemble   of   possible   trajectories.   This undivided connection is mediated by the   quantum   potential which arises as   an   extra potential term in the Hamilton-Jacobi-like equation, which may be derived by substituting   t/J   =   ReiS/th   in the Schrodinger equation   and   separating the real   and   imaginary parts, as Bohm did in 1952.   In   addition to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation:  as   (VS)2   h   2   V   2   R  --=--+   v--- at   2m   2m   R  one finds a continuity equation with   P   =   R   2 : ap   (VS) -   +   VÂ·   P-   =   0  at   m  [1] [2] Rand   S   are interpreted as the amplitude   and   phase   of   the real   t/J   field. The possible real average motions   of   a particle may be represented by trajectories derived from the relation   that   the particle   momentum   is given   by:  ft   =   VS   [3] In   the   many-body   case,   particle   motions   are   correlated   by   the quantum   potential in a non-local way, although in the scalar case this action at-a-distance does   not   give rise to any special problems. Even in the relativistic case, where non-locality may be thought to conflict with the requirements   of   relativistic causality, it   can   be shown   that this connection   is   mediated superluminally, yet causally,   and   cannot lead   to   any   results   conflicting   with   the   predictions   of special   re- lativity   15,16. An exact calculation has been carried   out   in detail by Philippidis   et al.   17   in   the   causal   interpretation   of   the   one-particle   Schrodinger equation description   of   the two-slit experiment. Here   we   represent the form   of   the   quantum   potential   and   the associated trajectories in Figure 9.2   and   Figure   9.3   respectively. The intensity distribution   at   the screen depends   on   the density of trajectories along with their occupation probability,   and   of   course agrees in the Fraunhoffer limit with   that expected from the usual considerations. The precise form   of   each trajectory   is   sensitive to changes in vari- ables describing the particle's environment. The distribution of tra- jectories demonstrates   that   each particle travelling in the   apparatus

Yet   we   are not required to relinquish the attempt to explain the interphenomena   in   terms   of space-time   co-ordination   and   causal connection simultaneously. The unity of system and environment, so clearly demonstrated in the double-slit trajectories,   is   then revealed as the essentially new non- classical feature of quantum mechanics.   Of   course the single-particle description   is   an   abstraction and this unity   is   really a reflection of the non-local character of the correlations that arise in the many-body case.

None   of the tra- jectories crosses the line   of   symmetry (a point confirmed by Prosser, who calculated lines   of   energy flow in the electromagnetic case   21   )   and this   is   a new macroscopic prediction.  (iv)   Wave-packet   collapse  In   the Bohr-Einstein debate, Bohr was able to defend the comple- mentarity principle by showing   that   attempts to use detailed energy or   momentum   conservation   in   individual   processes   to   determine particle trajectories more closely requires a change   of   the experimental arrangement   which   results   in a   loss   of   interference   and   the   wave aspect.   Bohr never referred to wave-packet collapse in these argu- ments. However, many   of   his supporters did   and   the concept   is   asso- ciated   with   his   interpretation.   Using   the   concept   of   wave-packet collapse to provide a physical interpretation   of   the   quantum   formalism is   contrary to the spirit   of   Bohr's epistemological position. Never- theless the argument   is   often   put   in the following way in   CIQM.   The introduction of a device capable   of   determining through which slit a particle passes induces a collapse   of   the wave function in the apparatus and   a consequent loss   of   interference. Such a collapse follows from the assumption   that   the wave function provides a complete description of   an   individual   system.   In   fact   it   is   an   hypothesis   added   to   the quantum   formalism   and   not   an   integral   part   of   that   formalism, al- though   this   is   not   the impression given in most   texts.   Arguments demonstrating the redundancy   of   this   ad   hoc   postulate in   quantum theory have existed for a long time. Bohm, followed more recently by Cini   22   ,   have argued   that   wave packet collapse does   not   correspond to any objective real physical change in the state   of   a system.   By   including the interaction with the measuring device in the   quantum   description, it can be shown   that the interference between the components of a pure state   is   destroyed as a result   of   the interaction between the system   and   the macroscopic instrument,   which   is   in   effect   irreversible.   That   is,   there   are   no observable differences between the description   of   the composite in terms   of the   pure-state density   matrix   with   vanishing   interference terms   and   that   in terms of the mixture density matrix (with wave- packet collapse). If   we   find   out   which component of the pure state   is actualized in the process, the others may be disregarded as they can have no further influence   on   the behaviour   of   the system after the (irreversible) interaction with the macroscopic instrument has taken place. Wave-packet collapse   is   now simply a matter of convenience. The physical interpretation   of   individual   quantum   processes in terms of particle   trajectories   excludes   the   necessity   of introducing   wave packet collapse.

Also let the wave function   of   an   apparatus   introduced only in   path   II be   qJi   initially   and   qJ   f   finally, then   we   have:  qJi   ==   qJit/J1   +   qJit/Jn   ~   qJ   f   ==   qJit/J1   +   qJ   ft/Jn   [4J If,   through   its functioning the states,   qJi   and   qJ   f   become   orthogonal then interference   is   destroyed: qJ;   qJ   f   ==   qJ   t qJit/J   i   t/JI   +   qJ;   qJ   ft/Jilt/Jn   [5J and   the system (neutron,   photon,   electron) acts as a particle   that   goes either   on   path   I   or   path   II. Observation of the measuring instrument merely tells us which alternative   took   place   and   thus   we   replace   qJ f  by   qJit/J1   or   qJ   ft/Jn.   This   is   a collapse   of   the wave function which simply represents a change   of   our   knowledge   and   does   not   correspond to any real physical changes in the state   of   the system. If   qJi   and   qJ   fare  not   orthogonal   then interference persists: qJ;   qJ   f   ==   qJ   t   qJit/J   i   t/JI   +   qJ;   qJ   ft/Jilt/Jn   +   qJit/JlqJ;   t/Jil   +   qJ   ft/JnqJ   t   t/J   i   [6J and   the system acts as a wave in   both   paths. If by observing the   apparatus   we   could still in fact determine the path   of   the particle, then in   CIQM   the act of observation would have to cause real physical changes in the particle's state as a consequence of   a wave-packet collapse, since, if neutrons, electrons   and   photons are conceived as   particles   that   go one way   or   the other,   equation   [6J should reduce to   equation   [5J. Thus   CIQM   concludes   that   all   measurements   capable   of   de- termining the   particle's   path   imply orthogonality   of   the   apparatus wave functions initially   and   finally.   In   SIQM,   determination of particle path   need   not   imply orthogonality of   apparatus   wave functions   in order   to exclude the intervention   of   consciousness in physical pro- cesses.   What   appears as a 'pseudo-collapse'   is   the action of a macro- scopic measuring device which makes the interference terms negligible, as   is   consistently shown by Cini in a detailed application   of   the time- dependent Schrodinger   equation   to the interaction between a system and   a measuring device.   Thus   there   is   no   a priori   impossibility   of   path determination   and   persisting interference;   one   has   only to   find   an appropriate   measuring   device   that   during   an   interaction   with   the micro-system does   not   undergo a change to   an   orthogonal   state,   i.e. preserves the interference terms,   and   still offers a possibility to decode this small   quantum-number   change.   The   use   of   SQUIDS   and   no- demolition measurements could be considered in this context. The possibility to go beyond   CIQM   was   known   to Bohm, in his original   paper   3 ,   albeit in a different context. He remarks, in relation to the loss of interference properties   on   measurement:   'In   our   inter-

Neutron   interferometry   has   the   advantage   that   it   reproduces   the double-slit   configuration   with   massive particles   and   introduces   new possibilities for   interaction   through   the   neutron   spin,   thus   essentially altering   the   situation.

            Causal particle trajectories   181 waves have the same ambiguity as   other   pictorial descriptions   of   the interphenomena; only the classical concepts   of   material particles   and electromagnetic   waves   have   an   unambiguous   field   of   application. However, if we wish   to   discuss the   interphenomena   we   must   set Bohr's position aside (as in fact   most   physicists actually do).   Then   a clear choice exists between two possible explanations. Either: 1   we   say   the   neutron   does   not   exist   as   a   particle   in   the   inter- ferometer;   or 2   we say the   neutron   actually travels   along   path   I   or   II   only,   but   is influenced by the physical conditions   along   both. (a) The   CIQM   Suppose, with the usual   interpretation   of   the   quantum   for- malism, a particle were actually   to   travel   along   one   path,   then   the existence   of   the   other   would be irrelevant   and   interference   cannot occur. Interference arises   not   from   our   lack   of   knowledge   of   the   path but   from the fact   that   the   neutron   does   not   have one. Any   attempt   to reveal the particle between source   and   detector   induces a wave-packet collapse, i.e. localizes the particle in   one   beam,   and   interference effects disappear.   The   wave   and   particle   nature   of   matter   are   complementary aspects. Since in this view the   neutron   is   not   to   be conceived   of   as a particle before detection localizes it, questions concerning which   beam a given   neutron   enters   at   the region   of   superposition   cannot   be formu- lated   and   the question   of   explanation   is summarily closed. (b) The causal stochastic interpretation   If,   contrary   to   the usual   interpretation outlined   in   (a),   we   believe   with   Einstein   25   and   de   Broglie   12   that neutrons   are particles   that   really exist in space   and   time,   then   Rauch's statement, ruled   out   in the   CIQM,   can   be made; namely that: 'At the place   of   superposition every   neutron   has the information   that   there have been   two   equivalent   paths   through   the   interferometer,   which have a certain phase difference   causing the neutron   to   join   the   beam   in the forward   or   deviated direction'26. It   is   then   possible   to   suggest physical models   to   explain the caus- ation   of   individual events, a   non-existent   option   in   CIQM.   In   the SIQM   neutrons   can   be   thought   of   as particles accompanied by waves simultaneously;   the   particle   travels   along   one   path   through   the interferometer whilst its real wave is split   and   travels   along   both.   The waves   interfere   in   the   region   of   superposition   and   give   rise   to   a quantum   potential which carries information concerning the whole apparatus   and   determines the particle trajectories.   The   changing phase relations between the waves in I   and   II   lead   to   a changing   quantum potential   structure   that   determines   which   beam   each   individual neutron   enters according   to   its initial position in the wave   packet   and phase shift   x.   The   detailed   explanation   provided for the two slit ex- periment   and   square   potential   phenomena   27   may   be easily extended to   this case.   The   details   may   be found in reference   28;   here we simply

The results   of   the numerical calculation show that varying the phase shift factor   X   be- tween 0 and   2n   produces the correct type   of   interference figure. When  X   =   0,   n,   the effective potential (quantum   +   classical), as shown in Figure 9.5,   is   symmetric about the barrier centre. A series of violent oscillations develops on each side   of   the barrier potential. These arise when the incident wave interferes with the combination of its own reflected wave   and   the in-phase transmitted wave from the other side. Figure 9.6 shows the associated trajectories. Figure   9.5   The effective potential   at   the last 'set   of   crystal planes' with phase shift   n.   Corresponding to region   x   =   0.6 to   x   =   0.9,   T   =   4.0 to   T   =   12.0   on trajectory plot. With   X   =   n/2   the   situation   is   very   different.   In   this   case   the quantum potential oscillations are greatly reduced on one side of the potential barrier, in the region   where the density   of   trajectories   is large, and this allows the particles   to   be transmitted (see upper section of Figure 9.7). In the lower section notice that the quantum potential oscillations are enhanced and occur   at   an   earlier time, ensuring that all   the   trajectories constituting beam   II   are   reflected   (Figure 9.8). Those   constituting   beam   I   now   enter   the   potential   barrier   and emerge after the reflection of those in beam II,   both forming   the single emerging beam. In this case the reflected wave from beam I is   (almost completely) cancelled by the anti-phase transmitted wave from beam II.

Then   initially the wave function   of   the whole   (neutron   and   coil)   is:  'Pi   =   qJi(at/J1   +   bt/Jn)  and   the final state   is: 'P f   =   qJiat/J1   +   qJ   fbt/JII  [11] [12] [13] and   the   condition   for the observation   of   interference is   qJi   ~   qJ   f;   that is, the state   of   the coil is virtually unaltered   and   no   measurement   in the usual sense takes place. Then: 'P f   =   qJi(at/J1   +   bt/JII)  and   intensity:  I='P!t/Jf=2  with polarization:  p   =   (cos   (wrft   -   X),   sin   (wrft   -   X),O)  entirely in the   xy   plane.

The   observation   of   interference implies the wave aspect; hence the particle   cannot   even be said   to exist   during   the time between emission   and   absorption   in the detector. A particle   cannot   exist in   one   beam   (or   pass   through   one slit in the double-slit experiment)   and   take   part   in interference. However in   order to   describe the functioning   of   the coil we   must   use the complementary

            Causal particle trajectories   187 localized particle aspect. The energy transfer   that   takes place giving rise to the change   of   t/JII   is   described by Rauch in terms of   photon exchange between the neutron   and   the field   in the coil. Thus   the neutron   is   conceived as a   particle in one beam   to explain energy transfer   and   simultaneously as a wave existing in   both   to explain interference. The complementarity   of   wave   and   particle descriptions is   broken;   both   aspects must be used simultaneously in one   and   the same experimental arrangement. Complementary description   is   thus incomplete,   or   can energy be exchanged with a probability wave? (b)   The causal stochastic inter.pretation   InÂ· the   SIQM   we   use the   Feynman- Gell-Mann   equation for spin half-particles as a second-order stoch- astic equation for the collective excitations   of   the assumed underlying covariant random vacuum, Dirac's ether   31   .   32   . A spin half-particle   is conceived as a localized entity surrounded by a real spinor wave due to perturbation   of   the vacuum. While the particle really travels one way (path I   or   II), the spinor wave propagates in both paths. In path II the interaction with the rf spin-flipper inverts the spinor symmetry of   the wave while in   path   I the initial state   is   maintained.   What happens in the interference region can be now represented by the action   of   a   spin dependent   quantum   potential   Q   and   a   quantum torque r which can be shown to produce a time-dependent spinor symmetry in the   xy   plane. The particle travelling, for example, in path I   is   constrained by the spinor symmetry in the interference region   and its   + z   spin   is   twisted into the   xy   plane by the   quantum   torque. If it travels along   path   II it suffers   an   additional spin inversion due to the rf coil, yielding this energy to the coil while in the intersection area its  -z   spin   is   twisted again to the   xy   plane. Consequently, a coherent picture   is   established   which   accounts   for   both   particle   and   wave aspects.  (iii)   Measurement   and   time-dependent   spin flippers  Now, Badurek   et   al.,   who performed the experiment, have stated: 'This experiment has shown explicitly   that   the interference properties of beams can be preserved even when a real energy exchange takes place, which   is   intuitively a measurement'29. But does it constitute a mea- surement? The situation must be analysed carefully. Clearly   if the   functioning   of the   coil   is   a   measurement   in   the quantum   mechanical sense, then   qJi   would be orthogonal to   qJ f   and interference would disappear. The reasons for considering such   an interaction   as   a   quantum   measurement   process   are   the   following. First, there   is   an   energy exchange taking place unidirectionally from the passing neutron   to   the rf-circuit, since the energy   of   the initial state differs by   ~E   from   that   of the final state. This energy exchange, if decoded   and   extracted   from   the   resonator   circuit.   could   reveal

            188   J.-   P.   Vigier   et al. the passage   of   the neutron. Second, this energy transfer in the form of a   photon   transition establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the change   of   the   neutron's   spin state from spin   up   to   spin down. If   qJi   and   qJ f   are   not   orthogonal,   then   interference   and   spin superposition persist,   but   in   order   to   demonstrate   the coexistence   of particle   path   and   interference some means   must   be found   to   decode the small   quantum   number   change involved between   qJi   and   qJ f.  If, in spite   of   the   non-orthogonality   of   qJi   and   qJ f'   the particle   path could be observed,   then   in   CIQM   the act   of   observation itself (i.e.   our knowledge) would have   to   destroy the interference terms (wave-packet collapse), whereas this is   not   ruled   out   a priori   in the   quantum   po- tential   approach,   in which particle   path   and   interference are   not   ex- clusive   and   the wave function   of   the   apparatus   does   not   provide a complete description   of   an   individual   apparatus.   Within the   quantum potential   approach   one could consider, as we have suggested, the pos- sible   adaptation   of   quantum   non-demolition measurements to detect the passage   of   a neutron. Does   the possibility exist   of   detecting the passage   of   a   neutron   from the energy it transfers   to   the rf coil?   For   Bohr   the question   of   an individual energy transfer   to   the coil when it   is   part   of   the interfer- ometer set-up   cannot   arise, as this   amounts   to   an   attempt   to   subdivide the experiment. Actually changing the experiment   to   allow the de- tection   of   the energy transfer results in a complementary   phenomenon in which interference would   not   be observed.   In   the   quantum   potential approach   there is   no   contradiction between energy transfer   and   inter- ference. Consider the following possibilities. 1   If   the   single   energy   transfer   is   detectable   with   certainty   by inspecting the coil's state, then its final state   must   not   overlap with the initial state. However the   addition   of   a single   photon to the field in the coil does not, even   under   the   most   favourable assumptions   concerning   the   state   of   this   coil,   lead   to   any observable change (consider the field to be in a coherent state, for example). 2   If   it   is   possible, by introducing a superconducting   quantum   inter- ference   device   (SQUID)33,   to   detect   the   exchange   of   a   single photon,   then   according   to   the usual application   of   the   quantum formalism the implied orthogonality   of   SQUID   states destroys the interference. This experiment, if performed, would, if inter- ference   is   not   observed, confirm the non-separability   of   neutron and   SQUID   states.   If   on   the   other   hand   interference persists, then the experiment would contradict   quantum   non-separability; the SQUID   state would be decoupled from the   neutron   state. 3   If a single energy transfer is   not   detectable,   can   some device be added   that   stores the individual unidirectional energy transfers eventually leading   to   a detectable   amount?   Is so then this energy can   only   have   come from   the   passage   of   individual   neutrons

(iv)   Energy   conservation   and   the   double-coil   experiment  Consider   now   the   situation   with   two   time-dependent   rf coils,   one   in each   beam   34   .   In   this   proposed   experiment   the   doubts   raised   by Badurek   et   al.   29   concerning   the   phase-number   uncertainty   do   not apply   at   a1l   34   ,   since the resulting interference   pattern   is   stationary.   No theoretical objection arises for a possible detection   of   single   photon transitions   in the field   of   the rf spin flipper   on   this count. Ignoring   all   common   phase   factors,   the   wave   functions   of   the superposed   beams   are: with polarization:  P   ==   (0,0, -   1)  and:  \11   1 \11 f   ==   2(1   +   cos   X)  [14J [15J [16J [17J Spatial interference   is   recovered.   The   results   of   this single   appara~~s  are: each emerging   neutron   has lost   an   energy   ~E;   its spin   is   now 4odown'   in the guide field; 2   each   neutron   takes   part   in interference. In   order   to   explain the   measured   loss   of   energy, the   neutron   must pass as a particle   through   one   or   the   other   coil   and   exchange a   photon with the field.   In   the   quantum   potential   approach   this   is   consistent with   the   observation   of   interference;   in   a   description   based   on wave/particle duality it   is   not, as   both   particle (loss   of   energy)   and wave (interference) properties   must   be manifest simultaneously in   one and   the same experimental   arrangement. A   measurement   of   the   polarization   of   the   neutron   behind   the interferometer reveals   that   each   neutron   has suffered a spin flip.   Each emerging   neutron   has lost   an   amount   of   energy   ~E   where   ~E   ==   2f.lB  represents   the   Zeeman   splitting.   If   energy   is   to   be   conserved   this energy   must   have gone   to   one   or   other   of   the coils. This   is   only pos- sible if the   neutron   passes as a   particle   through   one   or   other   and gives   an   indivisible   photon   of   energy   E   ==   hW   rf   ==   ~E   to   the rf-field. The   spatial interference   can   only be explained by assuming   that   the neutron   does   not   pass   through   one   or   other   of   the coils.

            190   f.-P. Vigier   et al. Since here both interference   and   spin direction can be measured simultaneously, according to   CIQM   the neutron actually travels path I   or   II and   at   the same time does   not   exist as a particle at all. In the Bohr-Einstein debate the application of particle momentum conservation in individual events always led   to the consistency of CIQM. Here the energy conservation leads to the inconsistency of CIQM,   since wave   and   particle aspects must be used together to ex- plain the observed results. If it   is   insisted in   CIQM   that neutrons do not travel one way   or   the other in this experiment, no energy can be transferred to the coils   and   then there   is   no conservation of energy in individual   events.   Further,   if a   statistical   ensemble   of individual neutron passages   is   considered,   we   see that, even there, there   is   no conservation of energy in   CIQM   when the interference   is   observed. We are confronted by a stark alternative. Either: we   renounce   any   possibility   of   describing   what   happens   in the   neutron   interferometry   experiments;   there   exists   then   no possibility of explaining   quantum   phenomena, not even in terms of a   wave/particle duality   which   only   leads   to   ambiguity;   in- dividual quantum   phenomena are in principle and   irreducibly indeterminist in character   and   there can be no form of physical determinism appropriate in the quantum domain;   or 2   we   adopt   the   quantum   potential approach as the only known con- sistent manner in which the   quantum   world can be conceived and explained in terms of a physically determinist reality; then, even if the quantum potential approach   is   not taken as the finally satisfac- tory description of quantum mechanical reality, it   at   least shows in a clear way the features   that   such a description must entail. Consider the question of energy conservation in a more general way in SIQM and   CIQM.   In   CIQM,   as emphasized by Bohr,   we   may only consider the energy of a system to be definite when the system   is in a stationary state. The system may only be in a stationary state in the absence of perturbing forces, such as those necessarily introduced in a measuring process. Such interactions are necessary to localize the system in order to allow a space-time description. Thus, in a transition between stationary states, energy conservation can be applied to the initial   and   final states but this excludes the conditions necessary for a space-time description. Bohr would say   that   when   we   are in a position to speak of space-time location there can be no question of energy conservation and, when energy conservation can be applied, the con- cepts of space-time co-ordination lose their immediate sense. In   SIQM   a stationary state means the particle energy given by   as/at  is   a constant. The quantum potential   is   time independent and the particle's motion   is   conservative in that:  (VS)2   as  ~   +   Q   = -   at   =   constant

            Causal particle trajectories   191  The particle can gain   or   lose kinetic energy   at   the expense   of   quantum potential energy.   For   example in   an   S   state   of   an   H atom, the particle is   stationary with energy   E,   this energy being held as   quantum   po- tential energy whilst the   quantum   force -   VQ   balances the Coulomb force - V V.   In   a different example, when   t/J   is   a plane monochromatic wave, the particle energy   is   a constant since the   quantum   potential vanishes. A more complex case   is   that   of the double-slit experiment discussed above. For   stationary states   and   systems which undergo changes between them, conservation   of   energy may be established in   both   SIQM   and CIQM,   but   SIQM   can also provide a space-time description. The case in which   'II   is   a superposition   of   stationary states   is   rather different, as discussed by Bohm   3 â¢   35   and   de Broglie   12   â¢   36   .   Consider the state: [18] where   'II   is   a sum   of   stationary states with energy   E k â¢  In   CIQM   we   simply say   that   the energy   of   the individual system   is not   well defined   but   that   upon measurement the value   En   will be found with probability   IC n   I 2 â¢   Thus any   ~ndividual   process   that   includes (as part   of   its initial   or   final state) a superposition   of   states of different energy cannot be described in terms   of   energy conservation. If   we insist   that   infinite plane waves represent   an   excessive abstraction   and the more realistic description   of   a free particle   is   a wave packet   or superposition   of   plane waves   of   different momenta, then   we   are led to conclude   that   energy conservation   cannot   be   applied even   to   the motion   of   an   individual free particle. The particle, in so far as it exists in   CIQM,   has potentially all the energies   E   k   with probabilities   IC   k   I   2 â¢  In   SIQM   a particle represented by a superposition of stationary states with different energies has a well-defined energy   at   each moment (dependent   on   its initial position) in the wave packet   but   this energy is   continuously variable with time. (However, the mean particle energy averaged over the ensemble   is   equal to the usual   quantum   mechanical result for the energy operator.) The variation   of   energy   is   due to the influence   of   the   quantum   potential which fluctuates with time. Thus in a wave-packet representation   of   the free particle   we   find   that   energy is   not   conserved for   an   individual particle since   as/at   =F   constant. Let us reconsider from this point   of   view the neutron interferometer experiment with one rf-coil in   path   II. Before entering the interfer- ometer the neutron has a well-defined energy   E   corresponding to   liz). On   leaving it   is   a superposition   of   states   of   different energy   E(i   z)   on path   I   and   (E   -   AE)(lz)   on   path   II. Thus the spin can be found in the  xy   plane,   by   the   measurement   procedure   described   above,   clearly demonstrating the principle   of   spin superposition (interference),   i.e. the state   is   not   a mixture   of   i   z   and   lz.   However this interference

            192   J.-   P.   Vigier   et al. observation requires us to relinquish the possibility of a description in terms   of   energy conservation. The   attempt   to apply energy conser- vation would require the use of a definite spin state in the guide field; that   is,   the state would have to be either   i   z   or   !z   (a mixture).   In   that case energy conservation could apply in individual processes since superposition   and   interference   is   lost. A neutron in beam   I   with   i   z retains its original spin energy whilst one beam II exchanges   ~E   with the coil. Thus   we   may choose to measure the   z   component of the spin   and   apply conservation   of   energy   or   observe the superposition and   deny energy conservation. The two are complementary. A similar situation exists in the two-slit experiments. If   we   wish to consider conservation   of   momentum   of   an   individual electron, then it must be described as passing through one slit   or   the other in order to exchange momentum. If it passes through one slit,   or   the other, then interference   is   not   possible. In   SIQM   the particles have definite positions, momenta, energy   and spin   at   all times, their associated (spinor) waves producing interference properties through the action of the (spin-dependent)   quantum   po- tential.   In   the   neutron   interferometer experiment   described   above there are then two possibilities depending   on   the   path   taken   at   the first crystal plane when interference   is   observed,   i.e.: interference region  ~E  incident beam   /(i)E   )   [E]   -   -  /pathI   2   ~   /'i.E  (j)E~pathII   (-)E   --  ~   i1E il /'i.E   ~E   2 (!)E   -   ~E   ---+   [E   -   ~E]   +   2   =   E   -   2  If   we   choose to measure the   z   component no superposition effects can be observed   and   energy   is   conserved   on   both   paths. If interference   is   observed then a neutron which travels in   path   I has an   overall loss   of   energy   ~E/2   while a neutron which travels   path   II has   an   overall gain of energy of   ~E/2   (~E   transfer to coil). Thus for SIQM, in   an   ensemble, energy   is   conserved when interference occurs. This   is   not   the case in   CIQM.   Also in   SIQM   when   we   include the possibility of energy exchange with the ether, through the action of the   quantum   torque which rotates   i   z   and   !z   to   ~xy   it   is   seen   that energy may be conserved even in the individual case. In general   we   see that in   CIQM   there   is   no possibility of recovering energy conservation in non-stationary situations; indeed, individual processes have no real independent existence. Such a possibility does exist in   SIQM   if   we   assume   that   the particle exchanges energy with the sub-quantum Dirac ether. Indeed the re- covery   of conservation of energy in   real individual processes   is   a strong reason for accepting the existence of such   an   ether.

            Causal particle trajectories   193  We should note   that   the prediction   of   variable   or   non-constant energy made by   SIQM   does   not   contradict any experimental results of   quantum   mechanics. Indeed all the results of   quantum   mechanics can be reproduced by SIQM. Thus, as Bohm points out, when des- cribing the scattering of a particle wave-packet by   an   atom   whilst the interaction   is   still taking place   and   the   wave   packets   overlap the particle   and   atomic electron energies fluctuate violently   and   it   is   only when the packets separate   that   the energies obtain a constant value. The corresponding feature in   CIQM   is   given by the uncertainty re- lations   AEAt   >   11,   and   the energy of each system can only become defi- nite after a sufficient time has elapsed to complete the scattering. Thus the prediction of the existence of variable energies in   SIQM does   not   contradict any result of   quantum   mechanics.   In fact   the SIQM   can provide detailed information concerning the energy vari- ation along well-determined trajectories in space-time in particular experimental situations.   CIQM   simply does   not   deny the possible exist- ence of such energies if they are measured. The implication of this   is that   SIQM   can make predictions which do   not   contradict   CIQM   but, in going beyond what   CIQM   allows to be possible, in the sense of being more precise, clearly demonstrates its incomplete character. In particular,   some   effects   in   non-linear   optics   experiments,   i.e.   the ejection   of   a photo-electron 37   ,   photo-ionization of a gas   38   and fluo- rescence   39   ,   occur even when the laser frequency   is   in fact below the necessary threshold for the process (provided the beam   is   put   in a non-stationary state by focusing   or   by creation of a pulse). These effects can be interpreted in both   CIQM   and SIQM. However, by providing a   detailed   description   of the   individual   trajectories   and particle energies involved,   SIQM   can make testable predictions which are   not   possible in   CIQM.   In   SIQM   it   is   possible to predict   at   which points the particles of increased energy will be found   and   hence exactly where the effects should be observed   40   .   If such predictions can be confirmed the   CIQM   would be shown to be incomplete in the original sense of Einstein.  4   Quantum   statistics  In orthodox theory the wavelike density fluctuations of collections   of like particles are described using Bose-Einstein   or   Fermi-Dirac sta- tistics based solely   on   the notion of indistinguishability and the sym- metry   or   antisymmetry   of the   wave function.   However any   inter- pretation of   quantum   mechanics which asserts the existence of indi- vidual particle trajectories   is   faced with a problem when the question of quantum statistical behaviour arises.   Brillouin   41   had already in 1927 considered this problem. He argued   that   even if particles are identical   a priori,   it   is   easy nevertheless to distinguish them by their history. He then finds the auxiliary assumptions that enable quantum

When the elements are assumed to be independent classical statistics result, in order to   obtain   quantum   statistics some correlation between the dis- tinguishable elements must be assumed. Further, as has been more recently   emphasized   by   Feynman 42   ,   no   classical model   with   local interactions between the elements can ever reproduce all the results of quantum   mechanics. This represents a serious problem in the statis- tical interpretation,   and   in   SIQM. In   the derivation of the formulae of classical statistics with dist- inguishability,   the   assumption   that   the   elements   are   free   between random   local collisions   and   that   each distinct state has equal prob- ability leads, for   N   elements distributed   among   M   available discrete states, to the result   that   the probability of a set of occupancies   {nJ i   =   1   ...   M   is   proportional to the   number   of   distinct configurations corresponding to   {nJ: P{n i }   =   M-   N   N!/n   1   !   ...   11   M   !   [19J However, Tersoff   and   Bayer   43   have shown   that   Bose-Einstein statistics can be recovered with distinguishable particles if the assumption of equal probability distribution   among   available states   is   replaced by that   of arbitrary probability weighting.   It   has also been shown 44   that such   an   arbitrary probability weighting is a natural consequence of the   causal   interpretation.   In   this   interpretation   the   assumption   of random   local collisions   and   independent particles no longer holds. The average motions   of   N   particles given by: 1  V~   = -   a~s   (K   =   1   ...   N)  m   [20J are   determined   from   the   non-local   action   at-a-distance   quantum potential: [21J This potential acts instantaneously in the centre   of   mass rest-frame and also implies   that   the interaction   is   causal (since the individual Hamiltonians   H   k   =   ~P~PkJ1   +   Qk   satisfy   the   causality   constraints  {Hk,H j }   =   0)   so   that   all colliding particles are permanently correlated and   can   never   be considered free. This implies   that   ~ach   individual state   is   not   identical with all others, so   that   we   should attribute to each   one   a   different   probability   weighting   Wi   of course   requiring  M  o   ~   Wi   ~   1   and   L   Wi   =   1.   This weight depends   on   all former possible  l=   1  different real subquantal   random   motions in phase space, so   that   the total statistics results from   an   averaging over all possible   (J)i   in all possible configurations.

As   an   illustration   we   now show in a particular physical situation how the individual motions of particles under the influence of the many-body   quantum   potential   lead   to   different   statistical   results according to the type of wave function assumed   46   .   The causal inter- pretation of   quantum   statistics can thus be shown to provide an intui- tive understanding of   quantum   statistical results   (in terms   of cor- related particle motions), classical statistics arising as a special case when the particles are not correlated by the   quantum   potential. The case examined here   is   the following. Consider a harmonic oscillator potential:  kx 2   mw 2   x   2  v=-=-- 2   2 and   construct, by solving the Schrodinger equation, a wave-packet solution   35   :  ljJ(x,t)   =   exp ( -   iwt)   exp [   -tx   -   xo   cos   Wt)2]   exp  [ i(   sin   2wt   .)] "2   x~--2-   -   2xxo   SIn   wt   [24J This wave-packet solution   is   non-dispersive and, depending on the time parameter   t,   defines in the causal interpretation a set of possible trajectories for a particle located   at   the position   x,   where   X   o   is   the centre of a wave packet. Now consider the case of two particles, one in each of the wave packets   t/J   A(X 1   ,t)   and   t/JB(X 2   ,t)   in the harmonic oscillator potential. The packet   t/J   A   (x   1   ,t)   is   assumed to be centred   at   Xo   and, in order to simplify the calculations, the packet   t/Jn(x 2   ,t)   centred   at   -   x o.  It   is   clear that, depending   on   the assumed statistics (MB, BE   or FD), three wave functions can be written. These are:

A   standard   quantum   mechanical   calcu- lation yields the mean squared separation of the particles   and   it can be shown   that   the mean squared separation of the particles is in the BE case decreased   and   in the   FD   case increased with respect to the MB case. In   SIQM   individual pairs   of   trajectories   can   be calculated from suit- able initial positions in the wave packets   and   the results are shown in Figure 9.11. This figure provides us with the basic physical features of the process. The MB particles, being independent, possess trajectories that   cross one another. They propagate undisturbed   and   produce no interference. This   is   not   the case for BE   or   FD   particles. They   do   not cross   but   form interference patterns in which the two particles are   on the average closer together in the BE case   than   in the   FD   case. The correlation effects mediated by the   quantum   potential between the two particles determines their physical behaviour   and   conditions their different statistical averages   of   physical variables   or   observables. This can be easily understood in the   SIQM,   where particles obeying quantum   statistics are constantly submitted to the stochastic   random motions of the underlying subquantal medium, the Dirac ether. The symmetric   or   antisymmetric character of the system's wave function   is a consequence of the existence (or not) of local repulsive gauge fields and   not a first   quantum   mechanical principle. Thus it can be seen   that   MB   statistics (and independence) arise as a special case   of   the more general   quantum   statistics (and correlation) when the many-body   quantum   potential   is   separable in the particle variables.  5   Negative   probabilities  We have seen how accepting the physical idea   of   particle trajectories in the   quantum   domain   can   lead to the formulation of new physical questions which one would   not   be led to   on   the basis of the   CIQM. We end this   paper   by discussing   an   interpretative problem raised by relativistic   quantum   mechanics, namely the mathematical existence of negative probability density   and   negative energy solutions to second- order   wave equations, which, as in all   other   quantum   processes,   we argue can only be coherently treated by assuming the real physical existence   of   paths. Indeed, this   is   an   important   issue in the   SIQM since the very existence of paths in space-time implies positive pro-

Hamiltonian method due to Feshbach   and   Villars   47   ,48   that for certain well-behaved external potentials the   KG   solutions may be split into positive   and   negative energy parts associated respectively with positive and negative probability. To   see this, let us   start   from the charged scalar wave equation: [28] where   D   Il   =   all   -   ieAIl' e   and   m   are the charge   and   mass of the par- ticle moving in the external field   All'   the metric has the signature (-   + +   +)   and   the units are chosen so   that   h   =   c   =   1.   [28] may be expressed in the form:  i~   =   H(e)qJ   [29] where   qJ   is   a two-component wave function   and   H   is   a 2 x 2 matrix Hamiltonian.   One   can show   that   for the inner product  <<1>,'1'>   =   f<1>*lJ   3   '1'd   3 X   =   fjOd3X  where: [30] is   the conserved current, the mean value   of   H   in any state   is   positive:  < qJ,HqJ   >   >   O.   It   follows that, with   HqJ   =   EqJ,   the space   of   solutions of   equation   [29]   splits   into   two   disjoint   subsets:   {E   >   0,  <qJ.qJ>   >   O}   and   {E   <   0,   <qJ,qJ>   <   O}.   The   latter   subset   of solutions   may   be   mapped   into   positive-energy   positive-probability anti-particle solutions   by   means   of   the   charge conjugation   opera- tion: since from equation [29]:  H(   -e)qJc   =   -EqJC   andi~   =   -io  Thus, within the   CIQM,   one can show formally how, for stationary states, the signs   of   energy   and   integrated probability are correlated and   that negative probability solutions may be physically interpreted. Note though,   that   the local values of probability density may become negative   and   that   such motions remain interpreted. We shall now show how in the causal interpretation   we   are able   to   prove a stronger result   than   that   just   given,   and   in a way which   is   technically easier and   physically clearer.   Our   approach extends some brief remarks of de Broglie   49   concerning this problem. Substituting   t/J   =   e P   +   iS   ,   where   P,   S   are real scalars, in [28] yields the Hamilton-Jacobi   and   conservation equations: [31]

            Causal   particle   trajectories   199  8~1l   =   0   [32] where  M   2   =   m 2   -   DP   -   8 1l   p8 1l   P  is   de Broglie's variable rest mass and:  jll   =   2e   2P   (8   1l   S   -   eAIl)  is   the current (equation [30]). The assumption   of   the   SIQM   is   that   the   KG   particle has a drift velocity  u   ll   =   dx ll /dr  where   r   is   the proper time along paths parallel   to   jll.   In   terms of the momentum   pll   =   8 1l   S   -   eAIl,   u   ll   =   M-   1   pll   with   u   ll   u   ll   = -   1,   from equation   [31]. Defining a scalar density   p   =   Me 2P   we   may express equation [32] in the form   50:  Dp  -   ==   8   (pUll)   =   0 Dr   11  From   this it follows   that   along a line of   flow:  wMe 2P   =   K   [33] where   w   is   a volume element   of   fluid   and   K   is   a real   or   pure imaginary constant (which, however, varies from one drift line to another). If   on an   initial spacelike surface the motion   is   timelike, then from equation  [31] M   is   real   and   so   is   K.   Now, in the rest frame,   Uo   E   =   M   where the   particle energy   E   =   8   0   S   -   eA   0 .   It   follows   that   if initially   the motion   is   future-pointing,   with   E   >   0,   then   M   >   0 which   implies  K   >   0 (since   e 2P   >   0   and   w   >   0 always)   and   we   see from equation [33]   that   the timelike   and   positive energy character of the motion is   preserved all along a trajectory. Moreover, the sign of the prob- ability   density   jO   =   2e   2P E   is   correlated   with   the   sign   of   E   and will remain positive along a line of flow   if the initial motion   has  E>   O. Identical   arguments   lead   to   an   association   of   past-pointing negative-energy motions with negative probability densities   and   this coupling   is   preserved along a line of flow if initially   E   <   O.   Such solu- tions   may   be   mapped   on   to   positive   energy,   positive   probability density anti-particle solutions by the charge conjugation given above:  .   t/Jc   =   t/J*.  These results, proved in the rest frame, evidently remain valid under orthochronous Lorentz transformations. We have thus succeeded in separating the solutions to the causal

KG   equation into two disjoint subsets   {E   >   0,   jO   >   O}   and   {E   <   0,  jO   <   O}   and   shown   that   the causal laws   of   motion   prevent the de- velopment   of   one type   of   solution into the other. This reasoning holds for   all   external   fields   All   which   maintain   the   timelikeness   of the momentum   pll.   Should the external potential be strong enough, pair creation may occur   and   the separation   of   the solutions breaks down. In   addition,   we   assume   that   the initial   motion   is   associated with a wave packet so   that   the initial total probability   is   unity. This   is   an important   point, since de   Broglie   12   has shown how, with a   plane KG   wave   incident   on   a   partially   reflecting   mirror,   superluminal motions apparently occur in the region of the Wiener fringes. It seems that   these unphysical motions are a consequence of the excessive abstrac- tion implied by the use   of   plane waves. It   is   emphasized   that   we   have only been able to overcome the diffi- culty   of   negative probabilities by assuming   that   particles possess well- defined space-time trajectories,   and   that   they are subject to action by the   quantum.potential   (contained in   M).   With these assumptions,   we can immediately associate the sign   of   particle energy with the sign of local probability density,   an   energy moreover which   is   well-defined and   continuously variable for all possible particle motions (and   not just   for stationary states). The initial character of these motions   is preserved   for   all   time   by   the   Hamilton-Jacobi   and   conservation equations. If one accepts   that   the   quantum   mechanical formalism   is   complete then one must accept Feynman's statement   51   that   there   is   no   way of eliminating negative probabilities from the intermediate stages of, for example,   an   interference calculation. The problem   of   their physical interpretation then   cannot   be avoided. However, if one accepts the introduction of trajectories in the des- cription,   then   our   demonstration   above   shows   how   the   positive character   of   probability is preserved   at   every stage of the calculation. The association   of   positive probabilities with positive energy   is   of course in accordance with the principles   of   relativity theory. We note finally that, although   our   discussion here has been confined to a single   KG   particle   52   ,   our   method may be applied to the elim- ination   of   negative probabilities from the theory   of   the many-body KG   system,   the spin-l   Proca   equation,   and   the   spin-t   Feynman- Gell-Mann   equation   53. Finally,   we   wish to stress   that   the causal interpretation does   not reinstate the mechanistic classical world view. Particles may be de- scribed as possessing definite values   of   physical variables   but   these variables   depend,   through   the   quantum   forces   arising   from   the quantum   potential   and   torque,   on   the whole   quantum   state which includes the influence   of   the environment. The lessons   of   Bohm's work are clear. We   can   adopt   Bohr's idealist epistemology   and   deny the very possibility   of   analysing what happens

            Causal particle trajectories   201  within quantum phenomena, such as neutron interference. However we   should then be consistent   and   refuse to speak of the   quantum world as if it actually exists. The only other known alternative, which is   capable   of   reproducing all the results of quantum mechanics in terms   of   a physically determinist reality,   is   the non-classical causal interpretation.   Far   from   returning   to classical mechanics it   shows exactly how radical a revision of   our   concepts   quantum   mechanics entails. Even if it   is   not   taken as a fully satisfactory description of quantum mechanical   reality,   it   at   least shows in a   clear   way   the features that such a description must entail. The interpretations of Bohr   and   of de Broglie-Bohm-Vigier both emphasize   that   the fun- damentally new feature exhibited by   quantum   phenomena   is   a kind of wholeness   completely   foreign   to   the   post-Aristotelean   reductionist mechanism in which all   of   nature in the final analysis consists simply of separate and independently existing parts whose motions, deter- mined by a   few   fundamental forces   of   interaction, are sufficient to account for all phenomena. The difference arises in the methods for dealing with the situation. One thing however   is   clear; the organ- ization   of   nature   at   the fundamental level   is   far more complex than mere mechanistic models can encompass. The ghost cannot be exor- cized from the machine.  Conclusion  Throughout this contribution   we   have discussed various 'interpreta- tions' of the quantum formalism,   and   what has emerged   is   that the problem   is   not simply one of interpreting the same results in various ways. In fact there are good reasons for the argument that   CIQM   and SIQM   are essentially different theories between which a choice can be made in a no arbitrary manner. Moreover: 1   They   have   different   ontologies   since   the   real   existents are   different.   In   SIQM   individual   processes   are   real,   take place in space   and   time   and   have well-defined properties. In fact SIQM   can account for all the quantum properties of matter, in- cluding all the so-called paradoxes, within this framework without conflicting with the requirements   of   special relativity. Further it does this in terms   of   a model which   is   immediately intuitively clear and which allows a visualization   of   the actual   processes taking place. 2   All   events occurring in space   and   time can be attributed to material causes which are also processes taking place in   space-time~   albeit non-locally.   In   CIQM   the   behaviour   of matter   is   irreducibly indeterminate; for example,   nothing   causes the decay of an un- stable nucleus. 3   In some versions of   CIQM   the behaviour of matter depends on the cognizance of observers. Such a possibility does not exist in

            202   J.- P.   Vigier   et al. SIQM   in which the material world has   an   existence independent of the knowledge   of   observers. 4   Since   SIQM   allows a description   of   the causation of individual events, it enables a deeper analysis   and   understanding of phenom- ena with the possibility of developing more penetrating theories of these events which   CIQM   shrouds in mystery by the dogmatic insistence in the absolute   and   final character of complementarity and   indeterminacy. 5   The possibility exists in   SIQM   to   make testable predictions which go beyond, by being more precise,   but   nevertheless   do   not   con- tradict those   of   quantum   mechanics. 6   Complementarity   is   inadequate in the description of time-depen- dent   neutron   interferometry   and   requires   the   renunciation   of energy conservation in interference situations, whereas   the de- scription   of   SIQM   is   consistent   and   apparent   non-conservation of energy may   be explained   through   the   possibility   of   energy exchange with the ether.

            10 Irreversibility,   stochasticity   and non-locality   in classical dynamics  Ilya Prigogine   and Yves Elskens  Universite Libre   de   Bruxelles and Center   for   Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics, University   of   Texas at Austin  It   is   a privilege to contribute to this volume honouring   David   Bohm. There   is   no   need to enumerate his   basic contributions to   modern theoretical physics; these are well   known   to the scientific community. What   IS   however unique   about   David   Bohm   is   his deep involvement in epistemological problems.   In   this perspective, there is probably   no single concept more fundamental   than   time in its connection with cosmology.   As   Karl   Popper   beautifully writes   1:   'There is   at   least one philosophic problem in which all thinking men are interested.   It   is   the problem of cosmology: the   problem   of   understanding the world - including ourselves,   and   our   knowledge, as   part   of   the world.'  1   The   problem   of   time  It   is   interesting to recall   that   one of the deepest analyses   of   the concept of time is due to Aristotle   2,3   and   dates back twenty-three centuries. Aristotle's analysis, as developed in his   Physics,   is   very subtle,   and introduces the idea of a radical polarity in time; the celebrated defini- tion   of   Physica   iv,   219a-b   says   that   time   is   something connected with motion,   in   the perspective   of   the earlier and the later.   This   can   lead to divergent interpretations; the distinction of the earlier   and   the later may be   an   objective feature of the cosmos,   or   it   may   be due to the counting activity of the 'sou!'. We then have two different viewpoints: one which unites us with the universe;   and   one in which it   is   man   who introduces time in a timeless universe. This problem   is   still with   us. However, the reconceptualisation which physics   is   presently under- going places the problem in a new perspective. 205

            206   Ilya Prigogine and Yves Elskens  It   is   well known that the formulation of modern science by Isaac Newton occurred in a period of absolute monarchy, under the sign of   an   Almighty God, 'supreme garant' of rationality. The Western concept of 'law of nature' can simply not be separated from its judicial and religious resonances; the ideal of knowledge   is   patterned according to the omniscience   we   may ascribe to a Ruler.   For   Him, there would be no distinction   between past   and   future.   Therefore, in this   per- spective, in which the scientist represents the human embodiment of a transcendental vision, Time could indeed only be an illusion, in the words of Einstein 4 .  However, the atemporal world of classical physics was shaken by the industrial revolution. One of the greatest intellectual novelties   5,6 of that period was the formulation of the laws of thermodynamics by Rudolf Clausius in   1865:   'Die   Energie der   Welt   ist   constant.   Die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu.' In this view the world has a history. But beware: this history   is   a history of decay, of degrada- tion; a history expressed by the increase of entropy. At present, physics   is   in search of a third time, reducible neither to repetition   nor   to decay. One of the major developments of this century is   associated with   the study of non-equilibrium systems.   We have already mentioned the second law of thermodynamics, which expresses the increase of entropy for isolated systems.   For   a long time, the interest of thermodynamics was limited to equilibrium systems; today, interest shifts to non-equilibrium systems interacting with their sur- roundings through   an   entropy   flow.   Let us emphasise   an   essential difference   with   the   description   of classical   mechanics.   In   thermo- dynamics   we   are dealing with 'embedded' systems; interaction with the outside world through entropy flow plays   an   essential role. This immediately brings us closer to objects like towns   or   living systems, which can only survive because of their embedding in their environ- ment. The inclusion of dissipation leads to a drastic change in the concept of stability. If some foreign celestial body approached the earth, this would lead to a modification of the earth's trajectory, which would remain for ever; conservative dynamical systems have no way to forget perturbations. This   is   no longer the case when   we   include dissipation; a damped pendulum will reach a position of equilibrium, whatever the initial perturbation. We can now also understand in quite general terms what happens when   we   drive a system far from equilibrium. The 'attractor' which dominated the behaviour of the system near equilibrium may become unstable, as a result of the flow of matter and energy which   we   direct   at   the system. Non-equilibrium becomes a source of order; new types of attractors, more complicated ones, may appear,   and   give to the system remarkable new space-time properties (in phase space).   . We   cannot go further   into   these   questions,   which   are   now   the

            Irreversibility, stochasticity   and   non-locality   207  subject   of   an   extensive literature   7,8,9,10.   Let us only mention that, because   of   the constructive role   of   irreversibility,   we   need to reappraise the role   of   irreversibility   on   the fundamental level, be it classical   or quantum. Here a confrontation with the traditional point   of   view becomes unavoidable.   Indeed, the conventional viewpoint   is   that   the funda- mental   laws   of   physics   being symmetric with   respect   to   the   time- reversal transformation, there   can   be   no   fundamental physical basis for oriented time.   The   appearance   of   irreversibility in physical pro- cesses   and   the related   'arrow   of   time' are only the result   of   statistical averaging   (or   'coarse   graining'),   which   is   necessitated   not   by   any objective   aspect   of   physical   phenomena   but   simply   to   take   into account   our   ignorance   (or   lack   of   interest)   of   the exact dynamical state of the system.   Thus   Born, for instance, asserts   11   that   'irreversi- bility   is   a consequence   of   the explicit   introduction   of   ignorance into the fundamental   laws'.   This   would   make   a   chemical   or   biological structure   the   outcome   of   our   personal   ignorance,   which   is   para- doxical. However, the difficulties in introducing irreversibility   on   the funda- mental level are obviously very serious, as they lead us to question the meaning   of   trajectories in the case   of   classical dynamics, as well as   the   relevance   of   fundamental   theorems   such   as   the   Liouville theorem   12.13.   In this note,   we   want to emphasise that, in spite   of   such difficulties, the   programme   initiated by Boltzmann 100 years ago   can now   be   rigorously   worked   out   for   well-defined classes   of   unstable dynamical systems. As   a result,   we   now begin   to   decipher the message   of   the second law   of   thermodynamics:   we   are living in a world   of   unstable dynamical systems (in a sense to be specified later); moreover,   our   physical world has a   broken   temporal symmetry. There exist classes   of   initial con- ditions which are admissible while their time-inverse   is   not.   To   some extent   these considerations apply also   to   quantum   theory   and   re- lativity;   for   lack   of   space   we   li~it   ourselves   here   to   classical systems. Probably   the most fascinating aspect involved in the transition from dynamics to thermodynamics   is   the deep change in the structure   of space-time which   the   introduction   of   irreversibility requires   on   the microscopic level. Irreversibility leads to a well-defined form   of   non- locality   14.15   in which a point   is   replaced by   an   ensemble   of   points according to a new space-time geometry determined by the inclusion of   the privileged   arrow   of   time. We   cannot   hope to present a extensive account in this paper,   but   we   intend   to   describe some   of   the basic concepts involved in this new   approach   to dynamics. It   is   interesting to note   that   the need to go beyond the dynamical concepts, to include   among   the fundamental notions those   of   random- ness   and   irreversibility,   has   been   recognised   recently   by   various

It   is   also the direction which our   group   is   pursuing for more   than   two decades   20,   but   the novelty of the subject required for forging   of   appropriate mathematical tools and   framework, which were   not   available   at   the start   7,21,22.  2   Classical   and   modern   dynamics  Classical dynamics rests   on   the notion of   trajectories   in   phase space.   If we   let   w   =   (w   1   â¢â¢â¢   wn)   E   r   describe the state of a physical system, the system's evolution   is   represented by a one-to-one mapping: [1] from   r   to itself.   For   Hamiltonian systems,   and   more generally for flows, the mapping   St   is   invertible:   St   -   1   =   S_t   is   also defined as a one-to-one mapping of   r   onto   itself; the present configuration   w(O)   uni- quely defines all the past   and   future configurations   w(t),   -   00   <   t   <   00. Modern   analysis developed   an   alternative   approach   to   classical dynamics with the description of the system's state by a set of symbols  s,   taking values in   an   'alphabet'.~   according to the following rule. Let us first choose a partition   f!}J   of   r,   i.e.   a set   of   subsets   P   s,   s   E   ~,   covering  r,   such   that   P s   n   P r   =   0   if   s   =f.   r.   Then   we   say   that   a state   w   is   de- scribed by a symbol   s   if   WE   P   s   (s   is   a 'coarse-grained' description of   w).  If   we   make   sequential   observations,   say   at   every   time   t   E   7L,   the system's evolution defines the sequence s   =   (St),   t   E   7L,   of   the successive symbols   for   the   successive   states   w(t).   Then   the   dynamics   of   St  induces   on   the   sequence s a   symbolic   dynamics   in   the form   of a 'shift' mapping: [2] This   description   expresses   clearly   the   reversibility   of   classical mechanics: the sequence   (sn)   exists once   and   for all,   and   the flow of time leads to a mere relabelling   of   the symbols   Sn.  In the study   of   complex systems, involving many degrees   of   freedom, a description   of   the system's state by a single point   w   in phase space is   unrealistic. We thus resort with Gibbs to a statistical description, by a probability measure   d,u   =   p(w)dw   over   r.   The physical inter- pretation   of   this   ensemble   (through this paper, when speaking of the classical ensemble theory   of   Gibbs,   we   do   not   refer to Gibbs invariant ensembles - which   playa   fundamental role in the statistical mechanics of ergodic systems   7,23   -   but   rather to his presentation   24   of   the concept of   an   ensemble as a collection   of   systems: this presentation takes no account   of   time asymmetry)   is   an   assembly   of   identical systems with the same macroscopic properties; the evolution of the ensemble   is induced by the microscopic motion as: [3]

Moreover, for   Hamiltonian   systems in canonical co-ordinates,   Liouville's theorem   states   that the evolution   operator   U t   *   preserves the measure   dw:  r.   dW   =   f   dw  J'A   S-tA U   t   *1   =   1 2   for   any   measure   p(w)dw   and   functionf(x): f/(U/P(W))dW   =   f/(P(W))dW  [5] [6] [7] In   particular, the   Boltzmann   H-functional:  H[p]   =   Lpln   p   dO) is   constant   in time. However, while the volume (the 'measure')   of   sets in phase space is preserved, their shape   may   be highly deformed   or they   may   even fragment (see Figure 10.3 below). This deformation   or fragmentation gives the   appearance   of   an   approach   to   equilibrium - where all   points   would be uniformly distributed in the phase space. But   this is only   an   appearance, as   H[l]   =   0,   whereas for   any   non- equilibrium distribution:  H[Ut*p]   =   H[p]   >   0   [8] In   the classical view, the world is thus similar   to   a   museum   in which information is   stored   once   and   for all. Time could   then   be   compared to   a   patient   demolition   of   artefacts   into   pieces, which   are   preserved and   could be used   to   reconstruct the artefacts in full detail. For   nearly   three   centuries   after   Newton,   classical   dynamics appeared   as   a   closed   method   enabling   one   to   compute   whatever physical   quantity   from first   principles   and   well-defined initial data. This holds true,   but   only for a limited class   of   dynamical systems, for the recent developments in dynamics show (see examples in section   3) that   'many'   dynamical systems are   unstable; in such systems, each region   of   phase   space (whatever its size)   contains   many   diverging

In this context, it   is   interesting   to   recall the classification   of   dynami- cal systems recently proposed by Ford, Eckhardt   and   Vivaldi   25,26: 1   for   'algorithmically   (A-)integrable' systems,   the action   of   St   is coherent enough for the trajectory   of   a point to be computable with arbitrary precision over any time lapse quite easily from prescribed   initial   data;   the   orbits   of   neighbouring   points   are (marginally in general) stable; examples   of   such systems include all analytically integrable systems, 'rational' planar billiards, etc.; 2   to the opposite, 'Kolmogorov' (K-) systems exhibit a complex behaviour   of   individual trajectories, like exponential divergence, to   the effect   that   no   finite   algorithm   (including   its   data)   can reliably compute the motion   of   phase points sensibly faster   than the dynamics itself; systems   of   this kind include geodesic flow   on surfaces with negative curvature,   hard   spheres in three dimensions, the planar Lorentz gas model, etc. The essential difference between the two classes   is   that   the concept of 'the phase-space trajectory   of   the system'   is   operational in A-integrable systems   and   useless in   Kolmogorov   systems.   It   becomes   therefore natural to look for a formulation   of   dynamics which eliminates for the K-systems the unobservable concept   of   a   trajectory.   One   may expect   that   this elimination would also permit us to include in the frame of dynamics the concept   of   irreversibility; accordingly,   we   con- sider   that   the natural theoretical framework for unstable dynamical systems   is   a theory   of   semi-groups rather   than   groups. The main object   of   this   paper   is   to   provide   an   elementary presenta- tion   of   this transition from dynamical groups to semi-groups in the framework of statistical mechanics   and   ergodic theory. Before showing this construction, let us give two simple examples   of   K-systems.  3   The   baker   transformation   and   the   hard-point   gas  To   clarify the mathematical properties involved in this discussion, let us   introduce two simple K-systems. We first consider the baker trans- formation of the unit square   27:   on   the phase space   r   =   [0,1[   x   [0,1[, we   define the mapping   Sl:   r   ----.   r:   (x,   y)   ~   (x',   y')   where (see Figure 10.1   ):  { X'   =   2x   (mod   1)  y'   =   (y   +   2x   -   x' )/2   [9]

Each particle moves freely   at   constant   velocity until it meets   another   particle - in which case it reverses its velocity (see Figure 10.2).   The   motion   of particle   k   is   thus   completely specified by the   data   of   its initial position  xk(O)   and   velocity   vk(O),   along   with a sequence   (Ck(t)),   t   E   7L,   where  Ck(t)   =   -1   (resp.   +   1)   if the particle suffers a collision (resp.   no   col- lision)   at   time   t.  It   can   be shown   that   the   motion   of   a single particle (say   k   =   0) for all times   -   00   <   t   <   00,   determines completely the initial   data  (xk(O),   vk(O)),   k   E   7L,   and   hence the   motion   of   all particles for all times. Besides, the evolution   of   the sequence   Co(n), n   E   7L,   under   the dynamics  St   reduces   to   a shift   O"tCo(n)   =   Co(n   -   t).   The Bernoullian distribu- tion   of   initial positions   and   velocities translates in this picture   to   a Bernoulli distribution   B(y,   1 -   y)   for the sequence   Co(n), n   E   L,   on {-1,   +   1}Z   and   an   independent distribution   P(vo(O)   =   -1)   =   P(vo(O)  =   +   1)   =   1/2.   In   particular, if   y   =   1/2, the use   of   xo(O),   vo(O)   and  Co(n),   -   00   <   n   <   00,   maps   our   lattice gas model   onto   the   abstract baker   model.   The   hard-points   model is also a K-system,   and   the explicit determination   of   a particle's trajectory   during   a lapse   (t)   requires   an information   about   initial   data   of   'incoming particles' over a spatial interval with length   (2t).  Examples   of   unstable   dynamics   appear   today   in   many   fields   of physics.   In   celestial mechanics, for instance (the   paradigm   of   classical mechanics!),   a   statistical   approach   has   facilitated   the   study   of   the parabolic   restricted three-body   problem   8,29,   and   of   the distribution   of asteroids   in   the   solar   system   30,   for   which   orbital   perturbation methods   prove insufficient. These   examples   illustrate   the   inadequacy   of   the   concept   of   a trajectory   for   unstable   dynamical   systems.   For   such   systems   it proves impossible   to   verify by a   computer   experiment the validity   of Liouville's   theorem   or   the   invariance   of   Gibbs'   H-functional   over arbitrary   time intervals. Classical dynamics   thus   appears   as   an   ideal- isation which   cannot   be reached experimentally, be it in 'real world' experiment   or   through   a   computer   experiment.   Furthermore,   the breakdown   of   classical mechanics occurs   on   an   intrinsic   time scale (inversely   proportional   to   the   K-S   entropy   or   the   Lyapunov   ex- ponents), which   can   only decrease if in   addition   computational   errors are   taken   into   account. One   of   the reasons for introducing a new conceptual frame   at   the basic level   of   description   of   dynamics   is   to   develop   methods   able to deal   with   real-world   situations   without   introducing   unobservable concepts (such as initial   data   known   with infinite precision) in the theoretical scheme.   In   this sense,   our   approach   follows the trails   of quantum   theory   and   relativity.

The appearance   of   this concept   of   probability in the context of deter- ministic dynamics   can   only have two possible causes: it may result from   our   ignorance   of   some relevant variables   or   functions;   or   from the   actual   inadequacy   of   the   fundamental   concepts   of   classical dynamics.   The   analogy   with   the   problem   of   'hidden   variables'   in quantum   theory, to which David Bohm has so much contributed,   is obvious. For   time-dependent phenomena, a basic probabilities description may be formulated in terms   of   Markov   processes. These are charac- terised by a transition   operator   W   t *   acting   on   densities   p(w)   over   r:  Pt(W)   =   Wt*Po(w)   [12] whose   kernel   is   given   by   transItIon   probabilities.   The   transition operators   W   t   *   for a   Markov   process form a semi-group:  W o*   =   ~,   Wt*W r   *   =   W t   +   r   *   (t   ~   0,   r   ~   0)   [13] Most   physical   Markov   chains   have   a   single   invariant   probability measure   Peq(w):  Wt*Peq   =   Peq   [14] Let   Peq   =   1 for simplicity.   Then   the action   of   W t *   on   a non-equilib- rium distribution   P   i=   1 relaxes it towards equilibrium, as measured in a   natural   norm   II-II:  lim   II   W   t   * P   -   111   =   0 lim   r pt(m)   In   Pt(m)dm   =   0 t-+ooJr [15] [16] Thus   Markovian   processes   contract   the discrepancies between the non- equilibrium function   P and   the invariant equilibrium function   1,   where- as classical dynamics does   not   damp   non-equilibrium discrepancies but   only hides them by mixing pieces   of   phase space more   and   more intimately as time proceeds (see Figure 10.3); the   relaxation   to equi- librium (equations [15]   and   [16])   can   only   be   obtained   by means   of   a  non-local   description   of   the system's evolution.

Clearly, such a passage   cannot   follow from a uni- versal construction, as we expect it   to   be possible for K-systems   but not   for integrable systems.   Moreover   this breaking   of   locality   can   only occur   at   the level   of   distribution functions.   We   thus   associate with any   distribution function   p(w)   over   r   another   distribution function:  P   =   Ap   [17J obtained   from   p   by a   linear deformation.

The   evolution   of   P   itself must   also   be   consistent   with   the   deterministic   evolution   of   p   as imposed by the dynamics   St;   this implies   an   intertwining relation:  Wt*A   =   AU t*   [19J [20J between the unitary   operator   U t   *   and   the   contracting   operator   W t   *, describing the system's evolution in its two representations:  Pt   =   Ut*Po Pt   =   Wt*Po  The   role   of   A   in   the   transItIon   from   deterministic   to   Markovian dynamics deserves   more   physical considerations. First, such a deforma- tion   is   meaningful only for dynamically unstable systems, in which the notion   of   a trajectory is inadequate; this suggests   that   A   must   be   non- local,   which validates the   introduction   of   the probability concept   into

Second, it must guarantee the decay of distribution func- tions to equilibrium in the future, with no restrictions   on   their past behaviour; A must   break the dynamics'   symmetry   under time-reversal.  We shall return to these points in sections 7   and   8 after presenting   an explicit construction   of   such a deformation. Transformation   operators,   leading   from   classical   or   quantum mechanics to   Markov   processes, were first   introduced in   1973   by our   group   31,32   in   connection   with   kinetic   theory,   but   there   the large number   of   degrees of freedom causes supplementary complica- tions   21,13.   We therefore restrict ourselves in this paper to situations first considered by Misra, Courbage   and   one   of   us   (I.   Prigogine), where the mathematical construction can be worked   out   with full rigour   33,34.  6   Markov   processes   equivalent   to   deterministic dynamics  For   K-systems, non-local deformation operators can be constructed naturally as follows. The phase space   of   a K-system can be partitioned in a family   ~   =   {P   s   },   s   E   ~,   of disjoint subsets, which: 1   is   'generating': two points   w,   w'   almost surely visit different cells for   at   least one moment in their motion; 2   has 'trivial tail': the motion   of   a point   w(t)   across the partition's cells for   t   >   T   bears no correlation, as   T   -+   00,   with its motion across the cells for   t   <   O. This characteristic enables one to construct   an   operator   g-   conjugate to the evolution operator   35,22: [21J which   is   interpreted as   an   internal time   or   age   operator   on   the Hilbert space   $'1-   of functions with vanishing sum   (L   cp(w)   dw   =   0)' The existence of   an   age operator also yields   an   orthonormal basis  {qJtJ(   -   00   <   t   <   00,   i   E   I)   of   $'1.,   in which any distribution function in  L   2   admits a unique decomposition:  p(w)   =   1   +   L   atiqJti(w) ti  [22J In terms of eigenfunctions: [23J [24J

We   actually   require   that   A(t)   decrease   mono- tonically from   A(   -   (0)   =   1   to   A(   +   (0)   =   0,   and   that   it be log-concave  (A(t   +   n)/A(n)   is a non-increasing function   of   n,   for   any   t).   A genuine form for this function is   Ac(t)   =   min(l,c   t )   with 0   <   c   <   1;   the   constant c   depends   on   the   dynamics   under   consideration.   This   exponential decrease   of   A(t)   for   t   ---+   00   plays   an   important   role in   the   physical interpretation   of   the   operator   A,   which   we   discuss   in   the   next section. The   meaning   of   the profile function   A(   t)   is easily derived from the simple example:  Fop   =   P   =   1   +   LatiqJti  t~O  i.e.:  A O(   t)   =   1 if   t   ~   0,   Ao(   t)   =   0 if   t   >   0 [33] [34] [35] In   this case, for   any   non-equilibrium ensemble,   one   observes only the coefficients   ati   for   t   ~   0   and   not   ati   (t   >   0). As   the   initial   conditions on   p   involve all   the experimental   knowledge   on   the ensemble,   no reference   to   idealised   data   such   as   Dirac   distributions   (for which all coefficients   ati   are   needed with a precision   inaccessible   at   initial time) can   be   made   in   our   formulation. However,   the   choice   A(t)   =   Ao(t)   in   equation   [33]   is   particular   as the resulting   deformation   A   =   Fo   is   not   invertible;   in   general,   A(t)   >   0 V t,   so   that   A -   1   is defined densely over   L   2 .   Both   A   and   W t   *   are   non- local   operators,   because   the   functions   Ap   and   W t   * P   are   computed through   the coefficients   ati,   which   depend   on   the   values   of   p   over   the whole   phase   space   and   whose values affect   Ap   and   W   t   * P   over the whole   r.  7   Geometrical   aspects   of   the   A-transformation  The   construction   and   the   action   of   A-deformations   are   best presented for dynamical systems satisfying Anosov's conditions, like   our   two examples   27,36.   For   simplicity, we only discuss   the   baker   model. The   baker   transformation   (equation   [9])   contracts   all   vertical segments by a factor 2   and   dilates   horizontal   ones   by   the same factor. Therefore,   two   points   w,   w'   differing only   by   their   ordinates   move   along converging trajectories,   but   the slightest difference   in   their abscissae would   make   them   diverge exponentially.   For   any   point   w,   one   defines the   contracting   (stable)   and   dilating (unstable) fibres (see   Figure   10.4):  X~(w)   =   {w'   E   r:s j   =   S'j   Vj   ~   n,   Sn-l   ::f:.

            220   Ilya Prigogine and Yves Elskens  The   radical change in scope, which   our   theory introduces,   is   best realised by studying the   entropy   functional   38,39:  n[p]   =   -H[p]   = -   tP(W)   In   p(w)dw   [38J which   measures   the   amount   of   information contained in   the   non- equilibrium distribution   p   in   comparison   with   Peq   =   1.   It   is   easily seen   34   that,   under   the   action   of   the   semi-group   W t *,   the   entropy Q[PtJ increases with time   t   towards its equilibrium value like a macro- scopic entropy.   In   this context, the second law   of   thermodynamics appears as a   selection principle,   excluding ensembles with   an   infinite (negative)   entropy   like a   Dirac   distribution   b o( w, wo)   or   a distribution  pS(w, wo)   supported   by the contracting fibres   of   the point   Wo0   These distributions   (though   not   belonging to   L   2)   are admitted by the clas- sical   extended   Gibbs-Koopman   formalism   and   do   not   decay   to equilibrium. On   the   other   hand, a classical coarse-graining   40,24   would replace  b o   or   pS   by a distribution uniform over a finite cell   of   phase space, whose points generally belong to different stable manifolds; the asymp- totic evolution   of   the coarse-grained ensemble   is   then very different from   that   of the original one.   As   we   see, the classical coarse-grained ensemble's   approach   to equilibrium results from the mixing   of   images of   the partition's cells (see Figure 10.3)   and   does   not   follow from a definite   dynamical scheme,   since it corresponds to   no   group   or   semi- group   description   41. We would like   to   add   a   few   more technical remarks. We already saw   that   the action   of   A-transformations   on   phase-space distributions is   non-local. This non-locality   can   be expressed in a more precise way for systems like Anosov's   27   where one introduces a metric over the phase space   and   the instability   is   characterised by   Lyapunov exponents,  which measure the rates   of   exponential divergence   of   trajectories along all directions; for a metric   adapted   to the dynamics, the stronger the instability, the shorter the typical distance between the points (for   an 'infinitely strong' instability, all points would be mixed instantane- ously). The interval of time over which the   motion   can be predicted   is inversely   proportional   to   the   Lyapunov   exponents;   they   are   also related to the   K-S   entropy.   For   the   baker   example, the Lyapunov exponents are   (J   Â±   =   Â±   In   2,   associated to the horizontal   and   vertical directions   at   each point.

            Irreversibility, stochasticity and non-locality   221  is   that   the A-transformation, which remained to some extent arbitrary, can now be completely specified as   we   find   that   ),,(t)   is   then [40] The A-transformation acts as   an   effective cut-off for non-equilibrium states   on   a time-scale   ~   1/(1.   For   the hard-point model, this   is   just   the collision time-scale.  8   The   fundamental   entities   of   dynamics  The development of   modern   dynamics invites us to reconsider the traditional view   that   the microscopic description of irreversible pheno- mena should be justified by   our   ignorance of the exact microscopic states of physical systems.   To   the opposite, it   is   the very property of instability in dynamical systems as realised in Kolmogorov flows   that leads to the construction   of   Markov   chains, with their probabilistic and   time-irreversible character.   The statistical ensembles   on   which these   Markov   chains   act   differ   radically   from   Gibbs   ensembles, because of their non-locality   and   their   broken   temporal symmetry leading the system to equilibrium in the future. Indeed, the classical ensembles admit as a particular case the Dirac distribution,   and   the unitary   group   propagates it in time, following a single trajectory in phase space.   In   contrast,   our   Markovian   equations do   not   propagate Dirac distributions and, as   we   saw,   do   not   even admit them for initial conditions.   In   this sense, the basic objects   of (unstable) dynamics are no longer phase points   and   trajectories,   but extended distribution functions with   broken   time-symmetry evolving under non-local semi-group relations. For   Anosov systems, the instability of the dynamics   is   expressed by the appearance of new geometrical structures in phase space, relating the temporal concepts of past   and   future to the spatial ones of con- tracting   and   dilating manifolds. The flow   of   time, which was often considered as a macroscopic notion   that   eluded the microscopic laws of nature, here appears as intrinsically determined by the (microscopic phase-space) directions along which the instabilities manifest them- selves,   e.g.   by non-zero Lyapunov exponents. The example of abstract K-systems shows how deeply dynamics   is changed when instability   is   taken into account in the theoretical frame- work. We expect   that   similar considerations hold in general relativity and   quantum   physics,   whose   traditional   formulations   do   not   dis- tinguish between stable   and   unstable systems.   As   this distinction   is now universally accepted in the frame of the phenomenological de- scription   of   nature,   the   solution   to   the fundamental   problems en- countered by these theories today should come from the incorporation of new concepts in their formulation, as the ones discussed in this paper   42,43,44

            11 The issue   of   retrodiction in   Bohm's   theory  Y.   Aharonov   and   D.   Albert   Tel Aviv University and University   oj South Carolina  Bohm's pathbreaking hidden variable theory of 1952   1   is   often accused of artificiality   and   inelegance,   and   doubtless it   is   guilty of both. But to make such accusations,   and   to leave it   at   that, is to entirely miss the point.   What   Bohm was after in his theory was   not   elegance   and   not naturalness; Bohm's intentions were simply to produce a theory which,  whatever   its   other   characteristics,   had   logically clear foundations.   It   is for   that   clarity which Bohm's theory   is   highly   and   rightly praised. We should like to point to one very straightforward example of that   logical clarity here, one which   is   related to   an   ancient debate within   quantum   mechanics,   and   to some recent work   of   ours   2,3,4.   It concerns the question   of   retrodiction. The question   of   retrodiction might be posed like this.   Can   we   know more of   the past history   of   a quantum-mechanical   system   than   we   can in principle predict   about   its future? Or, more time-symmetrically   and more precisely, like this.   Can   we   know more   of   quantum-mechanical systems within the interval   between   two complete measurements   than can in principle be known   about   the past   or   the future of any single complete measurement? The conventional quantum-mechanical answer, the answer which follows   from   von   Neumann's   non-time-reversal-symmetric   collapse postulate,   is   'No.'   That   postulate dictates   that   the   quantum   state of any system   at   any time   is   determined (via the equations of motion) entirely by the result   of   the most recent complete measurement of that   system.   Upcoming   measurements,   whatever   they   may   be   (ac- cording   to   this view), determine nothing whatever   about   the state of the system   now;   they, rather, produce information   about   the state of the system   subsequent   to their execution. 224

            The issue   ofretrodiction   in   Bohm's theory   225  On   the other hand, the probability   that   a given experiment, carried out   within the interval between two other complete measurements   on the same system, will produce a given result,isknown   todependsymmetric- ally   on   the results   of   the measurements   at   the beginning   and   at   the end   of   that   interval (see references 2-4). Albeit   that   all this can be derived from the non-time-symmetric formalism, the time-symmetry of the experimental probabilities suggests   that   the   correct   underlying description   of   the   quantum-mechanical systems   ought to   be time- symmetric as well;   that   the results   of   experiments   on   both   ends of a given time-interval ought to be regarded as producing information about   the system   within   that   interval. This question, the reader   is   doubtless aware, has been   and   continues to   be the subject of a long convoluted   and   mirky debate; but, within Bohm's theory (and this   is   the point   of   the present note), this question can be posed   and   answered definitively,   and   with stunning clarity. Can   we   know more   of   the past   than   of   the present   or   the future? Bohm's answer   is   yes.   A very simple example will suffice to make the point. Suppose   that   a small impenetrable box   is   located   at   the point   Xl'  and   that   another   such box   is   located   at   the point   X2.   A single-particle system   is   prepared   at   time   to   in the state: (where   Ix 1)   is   a state wherein the particle   is   located within the box   at  Xl'   etc.) by means   of   a measurement   of   some complete set of com- muting observables   A   at   that   time,   and   that   at   some later time   t   2   the particle   is   found to be in the box   at   X 2 â¢  According to the conventional quantum-mechanical account, the state   of   such   a   particle   as   that   within   the   interval   to   <   t   <   t 2   is  Ix   l )   +   Ix 2   ),   and   its position (within   that   interval)   is   undefined. The fact   that   any measurement   of   X   within   that   interval would with cer- tainty have produced the result   X   =   X 2   has a very different explana- tion, within this account,   than   the fact that any measurement   of   A  within   that   interval would with certainty have produced the result  A   =   lJ..   According   to   the retrodictive (or, rather, the time symmetric) picture   of   references   2-4   both   A   and   X   are well-defined within the interval   (A   =   lJ.   and   X   =   X 2   there); within   that   picture it   is   in some sense the case   that   either   of   two   quantum   states (or, in some other sense,   both   of them) can be associated with the particle within that interval. Within Bohm's account, all this   is   splendidly clear   and   definite. The quantum   state, the   wave-function   of   the particle within the interval  to   <   t   <   t   2,   is   certainly   and   unambiguously   Ix   l )   +   IX2)'   and   the   posi- tion   of the particle   is   clearly   and   unambiguously   X   2   (it   is   hoped, by the way,   that   the reader will find this somewhat perplexing;   and   this

            12 Beables   for   quantum   field   theory  J.   S. Bell   CERN  1   Introduction  Bohm's 1952 papers   1,2   on   quantum   mechanics were for me a revela- tion. The elimination   of   indeterminism was very striking. But more important, it seemed to me, was the elimination   of   any need for a vague division of the world into 'system'   on   the one hand,   and   'ap- paratus'   or   'observer' on the other. I have always felt since that people who have   not   grasped the ideas   of   those papers (and unfortunately they remain the majority) are handicapped in any discussion of the meaning of   quantum   mechanics. When the cogency   of   Bohm's reasoning   is   admitted, a final protest is   often this: it   is   all non-relativistic. This   is   to ignore that   Bohm himself, in   an   appendix to one   of   the 1952 papers   2,   already applied his scheme to the electromagnetic field. And application to scalar fields is   straightforward   3.   However, until recently   4,   5   to my knowledge, no extension covering Fermi fields had been made. Such   an   extension will be sketched here. The need for Fermi fields might be questioned. Fermions might be composite structures of some kind   6;   but   they also might not be,   or   not   all. The present exercise will not only include Fermi fields,   but   even give them a central role. The dependence   on the ideas of de Broglie   7   and   Bohm   1,2,   and   also   on   my own simplified extension to cover spin   8,   9,10   will be manifest to those familiar with these things. However, no such familiarity will be assumed. A preliminary account of these notions was entitled   'Quantum   field theory without observers,   or   observables,   or   measurements,   or   sys- tems,   or   apparatus,   or   wave-function collapse,   or   anything like that'. This could suggest to some that the issue in question   is   a philosophical one. But I insist   that   my concern   is   strictly professional. I think that conventional formulations of   quantum   theory,   and   of   quantum   field theory   in   particular,   are   unprofessionally   vague   and   ambiguous. 227

            228   J.   S.   Bell  Professional theoretical physicists   ought   to be able to   do   better. Bohm has shown us a way. It   will be seen   that   all the essential results of ordinary   quantum field   theory   are   recovered.   But   it   will   be   seen   also   that   the   very sharpness   of   the   reformulation   brings   into   focus   some   awkward questions. The construction   of   the scheme   is   not   at   all unique. And Lorentz invariance plays a strange, perhaps incredible, role.  2   Local beables  The usual approach, centred   on   the   notion   of   'observable', divides the world somehow into parts: 'system'   and   'apparatus'. The   'apparatus' interacts from time to time with the 'system', 'measuring' 'observables'. During   'measurement' the linear Schr6dinger evolution   is   suspended, and   an   ill-defined 'wave-function collapse' takes over. There is nothing in   the   mathematics to tell what   is   'system'   and   what   is   'apparatus'; nothing to   tell   which   natural   processes   have the   special   status   of 'measurements'. Discretion   and   good taste,   born   of experie'nce, allow us   to   use   quantum   theory   with   marvellous   success,   despite   the ambiguity   of   the concepts   named   above in   quotation   marks. But it seems clear   that   in a serious fundamental formulation such concepts must be excluded. In   particular   we   will exclude the   notion   of 'observable' in favour   of that   of   'beable'.   The beables   of   the theory are those elements which might correspond to elements of reality, to things which exist. Their existence does   not   depend   on   'observation'. Indeed observation   and observers must be made   out   of   beables. I use the term   'beable'   rather   than   some more committed term like 'being'   11   or   'beer'   12   to recall the essentially tentative nature   of   any physical theory. Such a theory is   at   best a   candidate   for the description of   nature.   Terms   like   'being',   'beer',   'existent'   11-13,   etc.,   would seem to me lacking in humility.   In   fact 'beable'   is   short for 'maybe- able'. Let us try to   promote   some of the usual 'observables' to the status of   beables.   Consider   the   conventional   axiom:   the   probability   of observables   (A, B   ...   ),   if observed   at   time   t,   being observed   to   be  (a,   b   ...   )   is: [1] where   q   denotes additional   quantum   numbers which together with the eigenvalues   (a,   b   ...   )   form a complete set. This   we   replace by: the probability of beables   (A, B   ...   )   at   time  being (a, b   ...   )   is: [2]

            Beables   for   quantum   field   theory   229  where   q   denotes   additional   quantum   numbers   which   together   with the   eigenvalues   (a,   b   ...   )   form a   complete   set. Not   all 'observables'   can   be given   beable   status,   for   they   do   not   all have   simultaneous   eigenvalues, i.e.   do   not   all   commute.   It   is   important to   realise therefore   that   most   of   these   'observables'   are   entirely re- dundant.   What   is essential is   to   be able   to   define   the   positions   of things, including   the   positions   of   instrument   pointers   or   (the   modern equivalent)   of   ink   on   computer   output. In   making   precise   the   notion   'positions   of   things"   the   energy density  Too(x)   comes immediately   to   mind. However,   the   commutator  [Too(x), Too(Y)]  is   not   zero,   but   proportional   to   derivatives   of   delta   functions. So   the  Too(x)   do   not   have   simultaneous   eigenvalues for all   x.   We   would   have to   devise   some   new way   of   specifying a   joint   probability   distribution. We   fall   back   then   on   a   second   choice -   fermion   number   density. The   distribution   of   fermion   number   in   the   world   certainly includes the   positions   of   instruments,   instrument   pointers,   ink   on   paper   ... and   much   much   more. For   simplicity we replace   the   three-space   continuum   by   a   dense lattice, keeping time   t   continuous   (and   real!).   Let   the   lattice   points   be enumerated   by:  I   =   1,2   ...   L  where   L   is very large. Define lattice   point   fermion   number   operators: \fJ   +   (I)   \fJ(/)  where   summation   over   Dirac   indices   and   over   all   Dirac   fields is   under- stood.   The   corresponding   eigenvalues   are   integers:  F(/)   =   1,   2   ...   4N  where   N   is   the   number   of   Dirac   fields.   The   fermion   number   con- figuration   of   the   world   is a list   of   such   integers:  n   =   (F(I),   F(2) .   ..   F(L))  We   suppose   the   world   to   have   a definite   such   configuration   at   every time   t:  n(t)  The   lattice fermion   numbers   are   the   local   beables   of   the   theory, being associated with definite   positions   in space.   The   state   vector   It>   also we   consider   as   a   beable,   although   not   a   local   one.   The   complete specification   of   our   world   at   time   t   is   then   a   combination:  (It>, n(t))  It   remains   to   specify   the   time   evolution   of   such   a   combination. [3]

            Beables   for   quantum field theory   231  thought of as   just   a way   of   expressing the probability distribution. For   us   It)   is   an   independent beable   of   the theory. Otherwise its appear- ance in   the   transition probabilities (equation   [5])   would   be quite unintelligible. The stochastic transition probabilities (equation [5]) replace here the deterministic guiding equation   of   the de Broglie-Bohm 'pilot wave' theory.   The introduction   of   a stochastic element, for   beables with discrete spectra,   is   unwelcome, for the reversibility (I ignore here the small violation   of   time reversibility   that   has shown up in elementary particle physics; it could be   of   'spontaneous' origin, and, moreover, peT   remains good)   of   the Schrodinger equation strongly suggests that quantum   mechanics   is   not   fundamentally stochastic in nature. How- ever I suspect   that   the stochastic element introduced here goes away in some sense in the continuum limit.  4   OQFT   and   8QFT  OQFT   is   'ordinary'   'orthodox'   'observable'   quantum   field   theory, whatever   that   may mean.   BQFT   is   de Broglie-Bohm beable   quantum field theory.   To   what extent   do   they agree? The main difficulty with this question   is   the absence of any sharp formulation   of   OQFT.   We will consider two different ways   of   reducing the ambiguity. In   OQFTI   the world   is   considered as one big experiment.   God prepared it   at   the initial time   t   =   0,   and   let it run. At some much later time   T   She will return to judge the outcome.   In   particular She will observe the contents of all the physics journals. This will include of   course the records of   our   own little experiments - as distributions of ink   on   paper,   and   so   of   fermion number.   From   equation [13] the OQFTI   probability   D   that   God   will observe one configuration rather than   another   is   identical with the   BQFT   probability   P   that   the con- figuration   is   then one thing rather   than   another.   In   this sense there   is complete agreement between   OQFTI   and   BQFT   on   the result   of God's   big experiment- including the results   of   our   little ones. OQFT1,   in contrast with BQFT, says nothing   about   events in the system in between preparation   and   observation. However adequate this may be from   an   Olympian point   of   view, it   is   rather unsatisfactory for   us.   We live in between creation   and   last judgment -   and   imagine that   we   experience events.   In   this respect another version   of   OQFT   is more appealing.   In   OQFT2,   whenever the state can be resolved into a sum   of   two (or more) terms:  It)   =   It,   I)   +   It,2)   [14] which are 'macroscopically different', then in disregard for the Schro- Â· dinger equation, the state 'collapses' somehow into one term   or   the other:

The   words   'macroscopic'   and   'collapse'   are   terribly   vague. Nevertheless this version   of   OQFT   is   probably   the nearest   approach to   a   rational   formulation   of   how   we use   quantum   theory   in practice. Will   OQFT2   agree with   OQFTI   and   BQFT   at   the final time   T?  This is the   main   issue in   what   is usually called   'the   quantum   meas- urement   problem'.   Many   authors,   analysing   many   models, have con- vinced themselves   that   the   state   vector collapse   of   OQFT2   is con- sistent   with   the   Schrodinger   equation   of   OQFTI   'for all   practical purposes'   14.   The   idea is   that   even when we retain   both   components in   equation   [14], evolving as required by   the   Schrodinger equation, they remain so different as   not   to   interfere in   the   calculation   of   any- thing   of   interest.   The   following   sharper   form   of   this hypothesis seems plausible   to   me:   the   macroscopically distinct   components   remain so different, for a very   long   time, as   not   to   interfere in the calculation   of  D   and   J.   In   so far as this is true, the trajectories   of   OQFT2   and BQFT   will agree macroscopically.  5   Concluding   remarks  We   have seen   that   BQFT   is in complete accord with   OQFTI   as regards the final outcome.   It   is plausibly consistent with   OQFT2   in so far as the   latter   is unambiguous.   BQFT   has   the   advantage   over   OQFTI   of being relevant   at   all times,   and   not   just   at   the final time.   It   is   superior to   OQFT2   in being completely formulated in terms   of   unambiguous equations. Yet even   BQFT   does   not   inspire complete happiness.   For   one   thing, there is   nothing   unique   about   the choice   of   fermion   number   density as basic local beable; we   could   have   others   instead,   or   in addition. For   example the Higg's fields   of   contemporary   gauge theories could serve very well   to   define   'the   positions   of   things'.   Other   possibilities have been considered by K.   Baumann   4.   I   do   not   see   how   this choice can   be   made   experimentally significant so long as the final result   of experiments   are   defined so grossly as   by   the   positions   of   instrument pointers   or   of   ink   on   paper. And   the   status   of   Lorentz   invariance is very curious.   BQFT   agrees with   OQFT   on   the   result   of   the   Michelson-Morley experiment,   and   so on.   But   the   formulation   of   BQFT   relies   heavily   on   a   particular division   of   space-time   into   space   and   time.   Could   this be avoided?

            Beables   for   quantum field theory   233  There is indeed a trivial way   of   imposing Lorentz invariance   4.   We can imagine the world   to   differ from   vacuum over only a limited region of infinite Euclidean space (we forget general relativity here). Then   an   overall centre   of   mass system   is   defined. We can simply assert that   our   equations hold in this centre   of   mass system.   Our   scheme   is then Lorentz invariant.   Many   others could be made Lorentz invariant in the same way; for example, Newtonian mechanics. But such Lorentz invariance would   not   imply a null result for the Michelson-Morley experiment   ...   which could detect   motion   relative to the cosmic mass centre.   To   be predictive, Lorentz invariance must be supplemented by some kind   of   locality,   or   separability, consideration. Only then, in the case   of   a more   or   less isolated object, can   motion   relative to the world as a whole be deemed more   or   less irrelevant. I   do   not   know of a good general formulation of such a locality requirement.   In   classical field theory,   part   of   the requirement could be formulation in terms   of   differential (as distinct from integral) equations in   three-plus-one-dimensional   space-time.   But   it   seems   clear   that quantum   mechanics requires a much bigger configuration space.   One can formulate a locality requirement by permitting   arbitrary   external fields   and   requiring   that   variations thereof have consequences only in their future light cones.   In   that   case the fields could be used to set measuring instruments,   and   one comes into difficulty with   quantum predictions for correlations related to those   of   Einstein, Podolsky   and Rosen   18.   But the introduction   of   external fields   is   questionable. So I am   unable to prove,   or   even formulate clearly, the proposition   that   a sharp formulation   of   quantum   field theory, such as   that   set   out   here, must disrespect serious Lorentz invariance. But it seems to me   that this is probably so. As   with relativity before Einstein, there   is   then a preferred frame in   the   formulation   of   the   theory   ...   but   it   is   experimentally   in- distinguishable   I9   ,2o,21.   It seems   an   eccentric way to make a world.  References  1   D. Bohm,   Phys. Rev."   85,   166   (1952). 2   D. Bohm,   Phys. Rev.,   85,   180   (1952). 3   D. Bohm and   B.

            13  Negative   probability  Richard P. Feynman   California Institute   of   Technology  Some twenty years ago one problem   we   theoretical physicists   had   was that   if   we   combined the principles of   quantum   mechanics   and   those of   relativity plus certain tacit assumptions,   we   seemed only able to produce theories (the   quantum   field theories) which gave infinity for the answer to certain questions. These infinities are kept in abeyance (and now possibly eliminated altogether) by the awkward process of renormalization.   In   an   attempt   to   understand   all   this   better,   and perhaps to make a theory which would give only finite answers from the start, I looked into the 'tacit assumptions' to see if they could be altered. One   of the assumptions was   that   the probability for   an   event must always be a positive number. Trying to think of negative probabilities gave me a cultural shock   at   first,   but   when I finally got easy with the concept I wrote myself a note so I wouldn't forget my thoughts. I think   that   Prof. Bohm has   just   the combination   of   imagination   and boldness to find them interesting   and   amusing. I   am   delighted to have this opportunity to publish them in such   an   appropriate place. I have taken the opportunity to   add   some further,   more recent,   thoughts about   applications   to   two-state systems. Unfortunately   I   never did find   out   how   to   use   the   freedom   of allowing probabilities to be negative to solve the original problem of infinities in   quantum   field theory! It   is   usual to suppose that, since the probabilities of events must be positive, a theory which gives negative numbers for such quantities must be absurd. I should show here how negative probabilities might be interpreted. A negative number, say of apples, seems like   an   absurd- ity. A   man   starting a day with   five   apples who gives away ten   and   is given eight during the day has three left. I can calculate this in two 235

The final answer   is   satisfac- torily   positive   and   correct,   although   in   the   intermediate   steps   of calculation negative numbers appear. In the real situation there must be special limitations of the time in which   the various apples are received   and   given since he never really has a negative number, yet the use of negative numbers as   an   abstract calculation permits   us freedom to do   our   mathematical calculations in any order, simplifying the analysis enormously   and   permitting us to disregard inessential details. The idea   of   negative numbers   is   an   exceedingly fruitful math- ematical invention. Today a person who balks   at   making a calcu- lation in this way   is   considered backward   or   ignorant,   or   to have some kind   of   mental block.   It   is   the purpose of this paper to point out   that   we   have a similar strong block against negative probabilities. By   discussing a number   of   examples, I hope to show   that   they are entirely rational   of   course,   and   that   their use simplifies calculations and   thought in a number   of   applications in physics. First let us consider a simple probability problem,   and   how   we usually calculate things,   and   then see what would happen if   we   allowed some of   our   normal probabilities in the calculations to be negative. Let   us   imagine   a   roulette   wheel   with,   for   simplicity,   just   three numbers:   1,   2,   3.   Suppose, however, the operator, by control   of   a switch under the table, can   put   the wheel into one of two conditions, A,   B,   in each   of   which the probability of   1,   2,   3 are different.

Now, however, suppose   that   some   of   the conditional probabilities are negative; suppose the table reads so that, as   we   shall say, if the system is in condition B the probability   of   getting 1   is   - 0.4 (see Table 13.2). This sounds absurd,   but   we   must say it this way if   we   wish   that our   way of   thought   and   language be precisely the same whether the actual quantities   Pia   in   our   calculations are positive   or   negative.   That is   the essence   of   the mathematical use of negative numbers - to permit an   efficiency in reasoning so   that   various cases   can   be considered to- gether by the same line of reasoning, being assured   that   intermediary steps which are   not   readily interpreted (like - 5 apples) will   not   lead to   absurd   results.

            238   Richard   P.   Feynman  probability greater   than   unity presents no problem different from   that of negative probabilities, for it represents a negative probability   that the event will   not   occur. Thus the probability of result 2   is,   in the same way:  P2   =   0.7 (0.6)   +   0.3   (1.2)   =   0.78 Finally, the probability of result 3 presents no problem   for:  P3   =   0.7 (0.1)   +   0.3   (0.2)   =   0.13 The sum   of   these   is   1.00 as required,   and   they are all positive   and   can have their usual interpretation. The obvious question   is   what happens if the probability   of   being in condition B   is   larger; for example, if condition B has probability 0.6, the probability   of   result 1   is   negative 0.4 (0.3)   +   0.6   (-0.4)   =   -0.12. But suppose nature   is   so constructed   that   you can never be sure the system   is   in condition   B.   Suppose there must always be a limit   of   a kind to the knowledge   of   the situation   that   you can attain. And such is   the limitation   that   you can never know for sure   that   condition B occurs. You can only know   that   it may occur with a limited probab- ility (in this case less   than   3/7, say). Then   no   contradiction will occur, in the sense   that   a result 1   or   2   or   3 will have a negative probability of   occurrence. Another possibility of interpretation   is   that   results   1,   2,   3 are   not directly observable   but   one can only verify by a final observation   that the result had been   1,   2   or   3 with certain probabilities.   For   example, suppose the truly physically verifiable observations can only distin- guish two classes   of   final events. Either the result was 3   or   else it was in the class   of   being either   1   or   2.   This class has the probability  Pl   +   P2'   which   is   always positive for any positive   PA'P Oâ¢   This case corresponds to the situation   that   1,   2,   3 are   not   the finally observed results,   but   only intermediaries in a calculation. Notice   that   the probabilities   of   conditions A   and   B might them- selves   be   negative   (for   example,   P A   =   1.3,   Po   = -   0.3)   while   the probabilities of the results   1,   2,   3 still remain positive. It   is   not   my intention here to contend   that   the final probability of a verifiable physical event can be negative.   On   the other hand, condi- tional probabilities   and   probabilities   of   imagined intermediary states may be negative in a calculation   of   probabilities of physical events   or states. If a physical theory for calculating probabilities yields a negative probability for a given situation under certain assumed conditions,   we need not conclude the theory   is   incorrect. Two other possibilities of interpretation exist. One   is   that   the conditions (for example, initial conditions) may   not   be capable   of   being realized in the physical world. The other possibility   is   that   the situation for which the probability appears to   be negative   is   not   one   that   can be verified directly.   A

            Negative probability   239  combination   of   these two, limitation   of   verifiability   and   freedom in initial conditions, may also be a solution to the   apparent   difficulty. The rest of this   paper   illustrates these points with a number   of examples   drawn   from physics which are less artificial   than   our   roulette wheel. Since the result must ultimately have a positive probability, the question may be asked:   Why   not   rearrange the calculation so   that   the probabilities   are   positive in all   the   intermediate states? The   same question might be asked   of   an   accountant who subtracts the total disbursements before adding the total receipts. He stands a chance of going through   an   intermediary negative sum. Why   not   rearrange the calculation? Why bother? There   is   nothing mathematically wrong with this method of calculating   and   it frees the mind to think clearly   and simply in a situation otherwise quite complicated. An analysis in terms of various states   or   conditions may simplify a calculation   at   the ex- pense of requiring negative probabilities for these states. It   is   not really much expense. Our   first physical example   is   one in which one usually uses negative probabilities without noticing it.   It   is   not   a very profound example and   is   practically the same in content as   our   previous example. A particle diffusing in one dimension in a rod has a probability   of   being at   x   at   time   t   of   P(x,t)   satisfying   oP(x,t)/ot   = -   0   2   P(x,t)/Ox   2 .   Suppose at   x   =   0   and   x   =   1C   the   rod   has   absorbers   at   both   ends   so   that  P(x,t)   =   0   there. Let the probability   of   being   at   x   at   t   =   0   be given as  P(x,O)   =   f(x).   What   is   P(x,t)   thereafter?   It   is: 00  P(x,t)   =   L   Pn   sin   nx   exp( -   n   2   t) n=1  where   Pn   is   given   by: 00  f(x)   =   L   Pn   sin   nx n=1  or:  Pn   =   ~   ff(X)   sin   nx   d~  [4J [5J [6J The easiest way of analyzing this (and the way used if   P(x,t)   is   a temperature, for example)   is   to say   that   there are certain distributions that   behave in   an   especially simple way. If   f(x)   starts as sin   nx   it will remain   that   shape, simply decreasing with   time   as   e-   n2t   â¢   Any   dis- tributionf(x)   can be thought   of   as a superposition of such sine waves. But   f(x)   cannot   be sin   nx   if   f(x)   is   a probability   and   probabilities must always be positive. Yet the analysis   is   so simple this way that no one has really objected for long. To   make   the   relation   to   our   previous   analysis   more   clear,   the

The   a   priori   probabilities are the numbers   Pn-   The conditions   i   are the positions   x   (the index   i   is   replaced by   x)   and   the conditional probabilities (these   do   not   satisfy equation [2], for   we have particles 'lost' off the end of the rod,   and   the state of being off the rod   is   not   included   among   the possibilities   i)   (if   n   then   x   at   time   t)  are:  -n 2   t   â¢  Pia.   ~   Px.n   =   e   sIn   nx  Equation   [4]   is then precisely equation [1], for the probabilities   Pi   of having result   n   is   now what   we   call   P(x,t).   Thus   equation   [4]   is   easily interpreted as saying   that   if the system   is   in condition   n,   the chance of finding it   at   x   is   exp   (-   n 2   t)   sin   nx,   and   the chance   of   finding it in condition   n   is   Pn.  No   objection should be made to the negative values   of   these pro- babilities. However, a   natural   question   is:   What   are the restrictions which ensure   that   the final probability for the event (finding a particle at   x   at   time   t)   are always positive?   In   this case they are simple.   It   is that   the   a   priori   probabilities, although possibly negative, are restricted by certain conditions. The condition   is   that   they must be such   that they could come from the   Fourier   analysis of   an   everywhere positive function. This condition   is   independent   of   what value of   x   one wishes to observe   at   time   t.  In   this example, the restrictions to ensure positive probabilities   can be stated once   and   for all in a form   that   does   not   depend   on   which state   we   measure. They are all positive simultaneously. Another possibility presents itself.   It   can best be   understood by returning to   our   roulette example.   It   may be   that   the restrictions   on the conditions   A,   B which yield a positive probability may depend   on what question you ask.   In   an   extreme example, there may be   no   choice for   the   Pa.   that   simultaneously make all   Pi   positive   at   once. Thus, although certain restrictions may make probability   of   result 1 positive, result 3 under these circumstances would have a negative probability. Likewise, conditions ensuring   that   P3   is   positive might leave   Pi   or   P2  negative.   In   such a physical world, you would have such statements as: 'If you measure 1 you   cannot   be sure to more   than   a certain degree that   the condition   is   A;   on   the   other   hand   it will be all right to think that   it   is   certainly in condition   A,   provided you are only going to ask for the chance   that   the result   is   3.'   For   such a circumstance to be a viable theory,   there   would   have   to   be certain limitations   on   veri- fication experiments. Any   method   to determine   that   the result was 3 would automatically exclude   that   at   the same time you could deter- mine whether the result was   1.   This   is   reminiscent   of   the situation in quantum   mechanics in relation to the uncertainty principle. A particle can have definite momentum,   or   a definite position in the sense   that an   experiment   may be devised   to   measure either one.   But no ex- periment can be devised to decide what the   momentum   is,   to   error   of

It   is   possible, therefore,   that   a closer study   of   the relation   of   classical and   quantum   theory might involve us in negative probabilities,   and   so it does.   In   classical theory, we   may   have a   distribution   function   F(x,p)  which gives the probability   that   a particle has a position   x   and   a momentum   p   in   dx   and   dp   (we   take   a simple particle moving in one dimension for simplicity   to   illustrate the ideas). As Wigner has shown, the nearest thing   to   this in   quantum   mechanics   is   a function   (the density matrix in a certain representation) which for a particle in a state with wave function   t/J(x)   is:  F(x,p)   =   fl/J*(X   -   y/2)   exp(-ipy)l/J(x   +   y/2)dy  (If the state   is   statistically uncertain we simply average   F   for the vari- ous possible wave functions with their probabilities.) In   common   with the classical expression, we have these properties. 1   F(x,p)   is real. 2   Its integral with respect   to   p   gives the probability   that   the particle is   at   x: SF(x,p)dp/(2n)   =   t/J*(x)t/J(x)   [8J 3   Its   integral   with   respect   to   x   gives   the   probability   that   the momentum   is   p:  SF(x,p)dx   =   qJ*(p)qJ(p)   [9J where   qJ(p)   is   the   usual   Fourier   transform   of   ljJ(x). qJ(p)   =   Se-ipxt/J(x)dx.  The   average value   of   a physical   quantity   M   is given by:  <M>   =   S",'M(x,p)F(x,p)dxdp   [10J where   W M   is a weight function depending   upon   the   character   of the physical quantity. The   only   property   it does   not   share   is   that   in the classical theory  F(x,p)   is   positive everywhere, for   in   quantum   theory   it   may   have negative values for some regions   of   X,p.   That   we still have a viable physical   theory   is   ensured   by   the   uncertainty   principle   that   no measurement   can   be   made   of   momentum   and   position simultaneously beyond a certain accuracy. The   restriction this time which ensures positive probabilities   is   that the weight functions   wM(x,p)   are restricted   to   a certain class - namely, those   that   belong   to   hermitian operators. Mathematically, a positive probability will result if   l'V   is   of   the form:  W(x,p)   =   SX(x   -   Y/2)e+   ipy   X*(x   +   Y/2)dY   [llJ where   X   is   any   function   and   X*   is its complex conjugate.

With this limitation, final probabilities are positive. To   make the analogy closer to those previously used,   we   can take two systems   a,   b,   in interaction, such   that   measurements   on   b   can provide   predictions   of   probabilities   for   a.   Thus,   using   the   one- dimensional case   again,   we   have   a   two-point   correlation function  F(xa,Pa;   Xb,Pb)   defined via   an   obvious generalization of equation [7] to two   variables. This corresponds   to   the conditional probability   Pia.  Then if a quantity   M   is   measured in   b,   the   a priori   probabilitie'i for various   Xb,Pb   are given by   an   appropriate   WM(Xb,Pb)   (the analogue of  P   a   in equation [1]). The probability   that   system   'a'   has position   and momentum   Xa,Pa   is   (the analogue of   Pi),   then:  P(xmPa)   =   SF(xa,Pa;   xb,Pb)wM(xb,Pb)dxbdpb  the analogue   of   equation [1].   As   an   example,   we   may take the strong correlation   possible   arising   from   the   two-particle   wave   function  J(x   a   -   Xb)   which   is:  F(xa,Pa;   Xb,Pb)   =   J(Pa   +   Pb)J(Xa   -   x b)  which means   that   the particles   a,   b,   have the same position   and   oppo- site momenta so   that   a measurement of b's position would permit a determination   of   a's   and   a measurement   of   b's momentum would deter- mine a's (to be the opposite). This particular   F   is   entirely positive   and classical in its behaviour, so   that   letting   WM(Xb,Pb)   be   J(x   a   -   b)   x  J(Pa   -   Q)   would   not   lead to negative probabilities directly, for equa- tion   [1]   gives   P(xa,Pa)   =   J(x   a   -   b)J(Pa   +   Q)   in this case,   but   further use of such a   P   in subsequent interactions has the danger   of   pro- ducing negative probabilities. We have become quite used to the rules of thought   and   limitations of   an   experiment, which ensures that they never arise in   quantum   mechanics. It   is   not   our   intention   to   claim   that   quantum   mechanics   is   best understood   by   going   back   to   classical   mechanical   concepts   and allowing negative probabilities (for the equations for the development of   F   in time are more complicated   and   inconvenient   than   those of   t/J).  (The classical equations for   F   for a particle moving in a potential are:  8F(x,p,t)/8t   =   -   p/n1   .   8F/8x   +   V'(x)8F/8p  while the   quantum   equations are:  8F(x,t)/8t   =   -p/m.   8F/8x   +   SG(x,Q)F(x,p   +   Q)dQ so instead of the momentum changing infinitesimally during   an   in- finitesimal time,   ~t,   it may jiump by   an   amount   Q   with probability when it   is   at   x:  ~tG(X,Q)   =   ~t   .   2   1m   Se   iQ   . f   V(x   +   Y/2)d Y

            Negative probability   243  which   is   a real,   but   possibly negative probability.)   Rather   we should like   to   emphasize the idea   that   negative probabilities in a physical theory does   not   exclude   that   theory, providing special conditions are put   on   what   is   known   or   verified.   But   how are we   to   find   and   state these special conditions if we have a new theory   of   this kind? It   is   that a situation for which a negative probability   is   calculated   is   impossible, not   in the sense   that   the chance for it   happening   is   zero,   but   rather   in the sense   that   the assumed conditions   of   preparation   or   verification are experimentally unattainable. We   may   give one   more   example.   In   the   quantum   theory   of   elec- trodynamics, the free   photon   moving in the   z   direction   is   supposed to have only two directions   of   polarization transverse   to   its   motion   X,.1'. When   this field   is   quantized,   an   additional   interaction,   the instan- taneous   Coulonlb   interaction,   must   be   added   to   the virtual transverse photon   exchange to   produce   the usual simple: [12J virtual interaction between two currents,   i   and   i'.   It   is   obviously rela- tivistically   invariant   with the usual symmetry   of   the space   ix,/ ...   ,i=   and time   it   components   of   the   current   (in units where the velocity   of   light is   c   =   1).   The   original   starting   Hamiltonian   with   only   transverse components   does   not   look   invariant.   Innumerable   papers have dis- cussed this   point   from various points   of   view   but   perhaps   the simplest is   this. Let the   photon   have   four   directions   of   polarization   of   a vector  x,y,z,t,   no   matter   which way it is going.   Couple   the time   component with   ie   instead   of   e   so   that   the   virtual   contribution   for   it   will   be negative, as required by relativity in   equation   [12J.   For   real photons, then, the probability   of   a   t-photon   emission   is   negative,   proportional to   -1<flitli>12   the   square   of   the   matrix element   of   it   between initial and   final   states,   just   as   the   probability   to   emit   an   x   photon   is  +   l<flixli>12.

For   example, if   k   is   in the   z   direction,   k=   =   w,  and   kx   =   ky   =   0 so   it   =   i=   and   we see   equation   [13J   is   equal   to   the usual result where we   add   only the transverse emissions.

But this restriction   is   not   to be applied to virtual photons, intermediary negative probabilities are   not   to be avoided. Only in this way   is   the   Coulomb   interaction truly understandable as the interchange of virtual photons,   photons   with time-like polarization which are radiated as real   photons   with a negative probability. This example illustrates a small point. If one   t   photon   is   emitted with   a   negative   probability   -   ~(a   >   0),   and   another   t   photon   is emitted say independently with probability -   f3(f3   >   0), the chance of emitting   both   is   positive   (-   a)(   -   f3)   =   af3   >   o.   Should   we   not   expect then to see physical emission of two such photons? Yes,   but   (if these photons are moving in the z direction) there   is   a probability to emit z photons   a   and   f3   also,   and   there are four emission states: two   t   photons with probability   +   af3;   two z   photons   with probability   +   af3;   the first z and   second   t   probability   (+   a)(   -   f3)   =   -   af3   and   the first   t   second z with   probabilities   -   af3   so   again,   for   total   emission   rate   only   the transverse   photons   contribute. Although it is true   that   a negative probability for some situations in a theory means   that that   situation   is   unattainable   or   unverifiable, the contrary is   not   true; namely, a positive probability for a situation does   not   mean   that that   situation   is   directly verifiable. We have no technique for detecting   t   photons   which is   not   similarly sensitive to z photons, so   that   we   can only always respond to a combination of them. Likewise,   no   direct test can be made   that   the two   t   photons are indeed present without including the additional probabilities of having  z   photons. The fact for example,   that   F(x,p)   is   everywhere positive: for the   ground   state   of   an   oscillator does   not   mean   that   for   that   state we   can indeed measure   both   x   and   p   simultaneously. As   another   example   we   will give   an   analogue of the Wigner function for a spin half system,   or   other   two-state system. Just as the Wigner function   is   a function of   x   and   p,   twice as many variables as in the wave function, here   we   will give a   ~probability'   for two conditions at   once. We choose spin along the z-axis   and   spin along the x-axis. Thus let   f+   +   represent the 'probability'   that   our   system has spin   up along the z-axis   and   up along the x-axis simultaneously. We shall define   the quantity   f+   +   for   a   pure state   to   be the expectation   of i(   1   +   a z   +   ax   +   a   y),   where   ax,a   y'   and   a z   are   the   Pauli   matrices. For   a mixed state   we   take   an   average over the pure state values. Likewise   f   + -   is   the expectation   of   i(   1   +   a z   -   ax   -   a   y),   f   -   +   is   the expectation   of   i(1 -   a   z   +   ax   -   ay)   and   f-   _   is   the   expectation   of i(1 -   a   z   -   ax   +   ay ).

Analogously   f+   _   is   the probability   that   the spin   is   up   along the z-axis   and   down along the   x-  axis   (that   is   pointing in the negative   x   direction). Likewise   f-   +   and  f-   -   give the probability   that   the spin is along the negative z-axis and   along the x-axis in the positive   or   negative sense, respectively. These   are   all   the   possible   conditions   so   we   have  f+   +   +   f+   -   +   f-   +   +   f-   -   =   1.   As   an   example,   we   might   have  f++   =   0.6,f+-   =   -O.I,f-+   =   0.3   andf--   =   0.2. Now   the probability   that   the spin   is   up   along z   is   simply the sum   of the probability   that   it   is   up along z   and   up   along   x,   and   the   other possibility,   that   it   is   up along z   but   down   along   x;   that   is   simply  f+   +   +   f+   -   or   0.6   +   (-0.1)   =   0.5 in   our   example. The probability the spin   is   down along z   isf-+   +   f--,   also 0.5.   In   the same way the probability   that   the spin   is   along the positive x-axis, independent   of its value along z   is   f+   +   +   f-   +   or   0.9. We,   of   course,   cannot   measure simultaneously the spin in the z   and   in the   x   direction, so   we   cannot directly determine   f   + _   and   there is   no   difficulty with its negative value. These four numbers give a complete expression of the state of the system,   and   the probability for any   other   question you can ask ex- perimentally   is   some linear combination   of   them.   For   example, the probability   that   a measurement   of   spin along the y-axis gives   'up'   is  f+   +   +   f-   -   or   0.8,   and   that   it gives   'down'   is   f+   -   +   f-   +   or   0.2. In fact, for a two-state system any question   is   equivalent to the question 'Is the spin   up   along   an   axis in some direction?' If   that   direction   is defined by the unit vector   V   with components   V x '   Vy,V z   then   we   can say the   probability   that   the   spin   is   up   along   this direction if the condition   of   the electron   is   + +   is   p   +   +(   V)   =   t(1   +   V z   +   V x   +   Vy ).  For   the other conditions   we   have   P+   _(V)   =   t(1   +   V   z   -   V   x   -   V y   ),  p-   +(V)   =   t(1 -   V z   +   V x   -   Vy ),   and  p   - -   (V)   =   t( 1 -   V   z   -   V   x   +   Vy ).   In   the general case then where the  fs   give the   a priori   probabilities   of   each condition the probability   of finding   the   spin   up   along   V   is   the   sum   on   a   of   Pa(   V)fa   or tÂ«1   +   V   z   +   V x   +   Vy)f+   +   +   (1   +   V   z   -   V   x   -   Vy)f+-  +   (1   -   V   z   +   V   x   -   Vy)f-   +   +   (1   -   V   z   -   V   x   +   Vy}f-   _).   In   order that   this always gives positive results, in addition to the condition that   the sum   of   the   fs   is   unity, there   is   the restriction   that   the sum of the squares   of   the four   fs   be less   than   t.   It   equals   t   for a pure state. If there are two electrons in a problem   we   can   use classical logic, considering each   of   them as being in one   of   the four states,   + +, +   -,   - +, -   -.   Thus   suppose   we   have two electrons, correlated so their total spin   is   zero, moving into two detectors, one set to determine if the spin   of   the first electron   is   in the direction   V   and   the   other   set to measure whether the second electron has its spin in the direction  u.   The probability   that   both   detectors respond   is   *(1   -   U.   V).   Thus if one   is   found up along any axis, the   other   is   surely down along the

Suppose the electron   can   be in one   of   a number of conditions   a,   for   each   of which   the   chance   of   being found   to   be spinning   up   along the   V-axis   is   P a(   V).   If   the second electron   is   in condition   b,   its probability   of   being found along   U   is   Pb(   U).   Suppose now   that   the chance of finding the two electrons in conditions   a,b,  respectively,   is   P   ab   .   This depends   on   how the electrons were prepared by the source.   Then   the chance   of   finding them along the   V   and   U  axes   is   La,bPabPa(   V)Pb(   U)   which is equal to   *(1   -   U.   V).   This   is   well known to be impossible if all the 'probabilities'   P ab   and   P   are positive. But everything works fine if   we   permit negative probabilities   and   use for   a   our   four states with the   PaC   V)   as defined previously. The pro- babilities for the correlated states in the case   that   the total spin   is   zero are   P ab   equal   t   if   a   and   b   are different states,   and   -   t   if they are the same. For   another   example   of   a two-state system, consider   an   electron going through a screen with two small holes to arrive   at   a second screen (see Figure 13.1). We   can   say there are four ways   or   conditions by which the electron can go through the holes, corresponding to the +   +,   +   -,   -   +,   and   -   -   conditions.   If   we   take   up   spin to corres- pond   to going through hole   number   1   and   down spin to represent going through hole   2,   then the   other   variable corresponding to spin in the   x   direction means going through the two holes equally in phase. Ordinarily   we   cannot   say which hole it goes through   and   what the phase relation   is   Gust as ordinarily   we   do   not   say which way the   z- spin   is   and   which way the x-spin is)   but   now   we   can   and   do.   For example,   f-   -   gives the probability   of   going   through   hole 2   but   180 degrees   out   of   phase (whatever   that   could mean).   For   each of these conditions   we   can calculate what the chance   is   that   the electron arrives at   a point   x   along the screen.   For   example,   P   + +   (x),   the probability for   arrival   at   x   for   the   condition   + +   (through   1 in   phase)   and  P   +   _(x),   the probability for   + -   (through   1   but   out   of   phase) are sketched roughly in Figure   13.1   as the curves   (b)   and   (c)   respectively. The independent probabilities are negative for some values of   x.   The functions through hole 2 are these reflected in   x;   P   _   +   (x)   =   P   +   + ( -   x)  and   P   _   _   (x)   =   P   +   _(   -x).   The   total chance   to   go   through   hole   1,  P   + +   +   P   +   _,   the sum of the two irregular curves shown in the figure, is   just   the smooth bump, the solid line   at   (a),   with its maximum under hole   1,   not   showing interference effects. But the total probability to arrive with holes   out   of phase,   P   + _   +   P   __   ,   shows the typical inter- ference   pattern   at   the   bottom   of the figure   at   (d).   '  Obviously the particular choice   we   used for the two-state system   is arbitrary,   and   other   choices may have some advantages.   One   way   that generalizes to any   number   of   holes   or   of states, finite   or   otherwise,   is this. Suppose   an   event can happen in more   than   one way, say ways   A, B,   C,   etc., with amplitudes   a,   b,   c,   respectively, so   that   the probability

If the two ways in   P,   'coming'   and   'going' are   not the same,   P   is as likely to be negative as positive. The density matrix,   Pij,   if the states are   i   is   then represented instead by saying a system has a probability to be found in each of a set of conditions. These conditions are defined by   an   ordered pair of states 'coming' in   i   and   'going' in   j,   with 'probability'   p(iJ)   equal to the real part   of   (1   +   i)Pij.   The condition   that   all physical probabilities remain positive   is   that   the square of   p(iJ)   not   exceed the   product   p(i,i)pU,j)  (equality   is   reached for pure states). Finally,   suppose   that,   because   of   the   passage   of   time,   or   other interaction,   or   simply a change in basis, the state   i   has   an   amplitude  Smi   of appearing as state   m,   where S   is   a unitary matrix (so the new density matrix   P'   is given by   ~lpS).   We then discover   we   can find the new probabilities   p'(m,n)   by summing all alternatives   iJ   of   p(iJ)  times a factor   that   can   be interpreted as the probability   that   the state 'coming' in   i,   'going' in   j   turns into the state 'coming' in   m,   'going' in  n.   This 'probability'   is:  !(SimSjn   +   SjnSim) +-f(SjmSin   -   SinSjm)  With such formulas all the results of   quantum   statistics can be de- scribed   in   classical   probability   language,   with   states   replaced   by 'conditions' defined by a pair   of   states (or other variables), provided we   accept negative values for these probabilities. This   is   interesting, but   whether it   is   useful   is   problematical, for the equations with amp- litudes are simpler   and   one   can   get used   to   thinking with them just as well. My interest in this subject arose from many attempts to quantize electrodynamics   or   other field theories with cut-offs   or   using advanced potentials,   in   which   work   apparently   negative   probabilities   often arose. It may have applications   to   help in the study of the conse- quences   of   a theory   of   this kind by Lee   and   Wick.

            14  Gentle   quantum   events   as   the source   of   explicate   order  G.   F.   Chew   University   of   California, Berkeley  Bohm   1   has introduced a notion   of   'implicate order' to complement the classical   Newtonian-Cartesian   real-world   view   of separable   objects moving through a space-time continuum. In the present note this classi- cal view will be characterized as 'explicate order.' Quantum-mechanical and   relativistic considerations preclude a satisfactory overall world picture based   on   explicate order;   at   the same time explicate   order   is   for many purposes accurate   and   useful -   being the underpinning   of   hard science.   What   is the source   of   such accuracy? We propose in this note that   explicate   order   together   with   space-time   is   an   approximation emerging from complex   but   coherent collections of 'gentle'   quantum events - the emission   and   absorption of soft photons. It   is   well   known   that   order   can   emerge from complexity; the laws of thermodynamics   and   hydrodynamics constitute examples. We suggest that   space-time   and   the   attendant   explicate   order   emerge from soft- photon   complexity in a sense analogous to the emergence   of   tempera- ture,   pressure,   heat   content,   etc.,   from   the   complexity   of   atomic collisions. The complexity responsible for objective reality within   an apparently-continuous space-time   we   propose to associate with multi- tudes   of   coherent   low-energy   electromagnetic   quanta.   Immensely- large   numbers,   stemming   from   the   combinatorics   of   soft-photon event patterns, are conjectured to be responsible for the notion of separately-moving objects. We shall identify special properties   that endow the   photon   with unique capacity to generate explicate order. Underlying   our   thinking   is   the Heisenberg matrix representation   of quantum   mechanics - which associates a complex   number   Sab   with a discrete event   b   ~   Q.   2   The event might be a particle decay such as that   of   Figure 14.1,   or   it might be a collision between particles, such as   that   of Figure 14.2.   The   probability   that   the event shall occur   is given by the absolute-value squared   of   the complex   number   Sab:  249

We conjecture   that   our   sense of continuous space-time   is   to be understood through collections of certain special 'gentle' events in which   an   initial electrically-charged particle emits   or   absorbs a   photon   and   a final charged particle appears with attributes almost the same as those   of   the initial particle.

A   photon   may carry   an   arbitrarily small amount   of   energy   and   momentum   and   thereby, in its absorption   or emission, disturb the charged particle to   an   arbitrarily slight extent. Particles with non-zero   rest mass lack   this capability; a minimum 'kick' accompanies their emission   or   absorption. A second essential photon   characteristic   is   its failure to carry any non-zero conserved quantum   numbers;   photon   emission   or   absorption   by   a   charged particle leaves the type   of   charged particle unchanged (e.g. electrons are   not   changed   into   protons).

A 'gentle event' -   synonym- ous   with   'soft-photon'   emission   or   absorption   -   leaves   a   charged particle   unaffected   except   for   an   arbitrarily   tiny   momentum   im- pulse. The   classical   notion   of   electric   field   corresponds   to   a   coherent superposition of large numbers   of   soft photons. The language of ex- plicate   order   describes a charged particle moving through   an   electric field as subject to a   force   which continuously changes the particle's momentum.   From   the   quantum   point   of   view, however,   momentum impulses are discrete - associated with individual photons. The illusion of continuity stems from the very large   number   of gentle   quantum events.   What   I   am   proposing in'this note   is   that   another   consequence of a multitude   of   gentle events   is   the classical notion   that   the charged particle follows a   trajectory   in   space-time.  There is   no   a priori   continuous space-time in the matrix   repre- sentation of   quantum   mechanics,   but   Feynman   discovered   that   the  superposition   aspect   of   quantum   mechanics   allows   the   complex number   Sab'   associated with a discrete event,   to   be evaluated through an   infinite summation over terms, each of which associates with a graph:   3  Sab   =   LS~b   [2J G In   this Feynman series, the symbol G stands for 'graph.' Each graph corresponds   to   a   pattern   of 'intermediate events'   that   might intervene between   a   (after)   and   b   (before). The violent event   of   Figure 14.2, for example, admits the intermediate event patterns of Figure   14.4,   where the wiggly lines denote soft photons.   Indefinitely-large numbers of intermediate   soft-photons   can   be   emitted   and   reabsorbed   by   the charged-particle lines   of   a   Feynman   graph. Feynman's rules for the complex numbers   Sab G   belonging   to   a graph G are such   that   large collections of   violent   intermediate events associate with such small complex numbers   Sab G   as to be relatively unimportant; a multitude of  gentle   intermediate events dominates the Feynman graphical-series.   2 The problem   of   summing the gentle-event series has taxed   the in- genuity of two generations   of   particle theorists.

Through Fourier transformation, energy-momentum variables can be replaced by   formal   space-time variables,   but   there   is   no   a priori   physical signifi- cance for these latter.   It   was recently discovered by Stapp   4,   however, that   summing the intermediate gentle-event Feynman series leads to a result interpretable through a notion of   approximate space-time local- ization.   Stapp   shows   that   the coherent superposition of a multitude of soft intermediate   photons   can   approximately place charged particles on   trajectories   and   also approximately localize their violent events. (Stapp also   makes a   precise distinction   between soft photons   and 'hard'   photons -   that   can change spin   and   deliver substantial in- crements   of   momentum   in   violent   events.)   Fourier   transformation becomes physically relevant. I propose   that   the space-time   of   explicate   order   arises from Stapp's mechanism.   One   should   not   accept a physical space-time continuum as   an   a priori   notion   but   rather as   an   approximation emerging from large numbers of coherent   but   discrete gentle   quantum   events.   My expectation   is   that   such   an   understanding of space-time will allow the Copenhagen interpretation of   quantum   mechanics to be replaced by a quantum   theory   of   measurement. The approximate isolation   of   ob- server   from   'observed   entity'   will   be   related   to   the   gentleness   of intervening   soft-photon   connections.   Electric   'screening'   will   be important   -   related to the photon's coupling to a conserved charge and   to   the tendency   of   complex particle systems to   be electrically neutral.   One   will   not   describe   measurement   as   occurring   'within space-time'   but   rather   as   generating   an   approximate   meaning   for space-time. I close this note with some remarks   about   'implicate order'   and 'hidden variables' -   terms which Bohm has invoked.   1   The foregoing speculations   about   explicate   order   have arisen in connection with   an attempt   to understand particle properties through the consistency of their   graphically-expressed   relationships.   5   Analysis   of   consistency depends   on   classifying   Feynman   graphs   accordin-g   to   complexity. Photons   and   electrons   do   not   occur   at   the lowest level   of   complexity, even though these particles dominate development   of   explicate order.

Suffice it to say   that   there is a connection with 'hidden' variables.) An example   of   a 'hidden' variable   is   a feature of graphical   order   called 'color.' The property of 'color' is   not   exhibited by any particles accessible to the hard-scientific measurements based on   explicate order,   but   a full picture   of   graphical   order   demands re- cognition of 'color'   and   other   'hidden' variables. At the level where such   variables function   there has   not   yet developed   the degree   of complexity prerequisite to the space-time   on   which explicate   order relies. Theorists who use graphical complexity to understand particles do   not   employ the term 'implicate order,'   but   where 'color'   and   other 'hidden' variables occur such a term may be appropriate. It   should be   apparent   from the foregoing   that   the   author   envisages areas   of   contact between graphical particle theory   and   the ideas of Bohm.   1   The advantage   of   graphs   is   their providing   an   unambiguous and   unprejudiced language - free from the semantic traps of ordinary language   that   stem   from   explicate-order   roots.   I   anticipate   graph language gradually to yield detailed understanding of how the con- tinuity   of   explicate order, with the   attendant   space-time, relates to the discrete world of   quantum   events. It   is   furthermore   not   ruled out, in the author's opinion,   that   graphs with gentle links will illuminate the meaning of life   and   consciousness   and   also cosmology -   including gravitation.   Supplemented   by   Feynman   superposition   and   by   dis- tinction   between   violent   and   gentle   vertices,   graph   language   has immense untapped capacity.

The classical aspects of nature would then emerge automatically from the evolution of the fully   quantum   mechanical system, with no intrusion of observers   or   scientists.   In   this theory the electromagnetic field (i.e. light) plays a central role: it   is   the carrier of   both   classical properties and   actual being itself. The model presented here has elements of arbitrariness   that   render it unsatisfactory as a true model of the universe: it   is   a rudimentary form of such a model,   not   a finished product. The technical development mentioned above arose in connection with the famous 'infrared catastrophe': the contributions of infinite numbers of very low-energy   photons   had   led to   apparent   infinities in the calculation of many physical quantities. The essential feature of the resolution   of   this problem was discovered in 1937 by Bloch   and Nordsieck: one must separate   out   the classical aspects of the problem. The original work   3   dealt only with simple cases,   and   involved ap- proximations,   but   it   was   developed   and   extended   in   an   immense collection of works by many authors. But there remained until recently the basic problem   of   understanding how the observed classical results emerged in all of the   appropriate   macroscopic limits. This problem was resolved recently by recognizing   that   there was an   exact separation between the classical   and   quantum   parts of the electromagnetic current. 4   The coordinate-space Feynman   path   of each charged particle has one set   of   vertices for the "quantum' interactions with light,   and   a different set of vertices for the "classical' interaction. The radiation from each classical vertex depends only   on   its own loca- tion,   and   those   of   the   two   neighboring   classical   vertices;   it   is independent   of   what happens between these classical vertices. Further- more,   an   arbitrary number of classical photons, all identical, can be emitted from   each classical   vertex~   These classical   photons,   whose character depends only   on   the locations of the   classical   vertices can be summed. The sum   is   a unitary   operator   that   creates precisely the unique coherent   quantum   state   that   corresponds to the light radiated by a classical charge moving   on   a space-time   path   defined by the sequence   of   classical vertices. Before showing how this identification of the classical   part   of the electromagnetic field provides the basis for a unified self-governing quantum   universe, with automatic emergence of classical reality, some peripheral questions will be addressed. The first question   is   whether there   is   any need for unified formu- lation of   quantum   theory. Bohr gave convincing arguments that, in the realm of atomic physics, no theory could give predictions going beyond   those   attainable   from   his   observer-based   formulation   of quantum   theory. However, the experimental situation encountered in atomic physics   is   far from universal. It involves large preparing   and detecting devices, which are considered to be parts of the full classi-

This   quantum   system must be small enough so   that   during the interval between its preparation   and   detection its influence   upon   the macro- scopic environment   is   negligible.   For   if the   quantum   system influences the macroscopic environment then phase information   is   transferred to this environment,   and   the Schrodinger equation fails. The macroscopic environment must then be described   quantum   mechanically, which contradicts the requirement   that   it be described classically. Conse- quently, as the   quantum   system   is   increased in size it must eventually reach the stage where neither the classical   nor   quantum   description   is adequate.   To   deal with such intermediate situations it would   appear necessary to treat in a unified way the full physical system   of   macro- scopic environment plus   quantum   object. It has been claimed   that   most physicists accept Bohr's interpretation of   quantum   theory.   Of   course, any physicist who uses   quantum   theory in a practical way in atomic physics   is   probably interpreting   quantum theory as a useful tool, in the way Bohr suggested. But   at   the level of basic principle the dissenters include most of the founders   of   quantum theory:' Einstein, Schrodinger, de Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg, Wigner, and   von Neumann, to name a   few.   Gell-Mann said 'Niels Bohr brain- washed a whole generation   of   physicists into believing   that   the prob- lem   had   been solved fifty years ago.'   5   Pauli   6   said: 'I think the im- portant   and   extremely difficult task   of   our   time   is   to try to build up a fresh idea   of   reality.' I   doubt   if any physicist can be completely comfortable injecting human   observers   and   invalid classical concepts into atomic theory, and   giving up the ideal   that   basic physical theory should describe the world itself. The two overriding considerations are   rather   that   Bohr's interpretation works fine in atomic physics,   and   that   even Einstein himself, in spite   of   intensive effort, was unable to propose any alter- native. The present proposal   is   based   on   two results   that   did   not   exist in Einstein's day. The first   is   the above-mentioned development of   our understanding   of   the classical   part   of the electromagnetic field,   and the second   is   the refinement in   our   ideas of locality   and   causality   that have grown   out   of   Bell's theorem.   7 The present proposal   is   in line with some ideas of David Bohm   8 and   Werner Heisenberg   9   that   will be described next.  Bohm-Heisenberg   idea   of   events  The wave function   of   quantum   theory has   many   similarities to the probability   function   of   classical   statistical   mechanics.   This   latter function   represents   the probability for   the   various   particles of the system to   be   in certain states   at   specified times. But if   we   were to place detectors in certain locations then it could also represent the

            258   Henry   P.   Stapp  probability for something to 'happen,'   i.e.   for the detectors to detect something. The square   of   the absolute value of the wave function of   quantum theory   has   an   intuitive   significance   similar   to   this   'happening'   or 'event' interpretation of the classical probability function,   and   Heisen- berg was willing to say   that   the detection event actually occurs   at   the level of physical device.   9   Then the probability for 'finding' the particle can be interpreted as the probability for this physical detection event to occur, quite   apart   from any   human   participant   or   observer. The difficulty with this idea   is   to know how to describe in a precise way what has 'happened.'   If   we   consider the 'event' to be the obser- vation by a   human   observer, then   we   know by education   and   training how to judge whether this observation conforms to certain specifica- tions.   And these specifications have, quite   naturally,   a certain im- preciseness, which allows for the necessary   quantum   fluctuations. But if   we   are going to consider the event to be something in the external physical world itself, then   we   need some sort of mathematical de- scription of what   is   happening. But what is the precise form of the description of device plus   quantum   object before   and   after the 'event'? If one tries   to   use only the   wave function   and   the   Schr6dinger equation of   quantum   mechanics then one finds   that   the 'event' never occurs. Rather, every possible event occurs: there   is   no singling   out   of the one event   that   actually occurs from the myriad of possible events that   might occur. The origin   of   this problem   is   precisely   that   the wave function has mathematical   properties   appropriate   to   a   representation   of   proba- bilities,   rather   than   actualities.   For   a system   of   n   particles the wave, at   fixed time,   is   a function in a space of   3n   dimensions. But   we   live in a space of only three dimensions. Thus, the wave function, like a classical probability function, represents all things   that   possibly can happen; it does   not   single   out   the one thing   that   actually does happen. To   represent the actual thing one appears to have three options: introduce object-like (or field-like) entities to represent the actual things; 2   introduce idea-like entities to   fill   up   all the 'mindful' possibilities corresponding   to   the multi-branched wave function; 3   introduce   action-type   entities   to   'collapse'   (i.e.   eliminate)   the unrealized branches of the wave function. The first alternative leads to the de Broglie-Bohm   8   pilot-wave idea, in which the   part   of the wave function   representing all of the un- realized   possibilities   awkwardly   continues   to   exist   in   an   objective sense. The second leads to myriads of parallel worlds   10   that   are all interpreted as objectively real,   but   which seem to be simply the conse- quence of insisting   that   the wave function represent objective reality itself rather   than   merely the probabilities for events. The third possi- bility   is   the one to be pursued here.   It   is in general accord with ideas

            Light as foundation   of   being   259  of   Bohm,11 Heisenberg,9   and   von Neumann.   12   The problem with this idea has been the unavailability   of   any objective way to single   out   the various   'classically   allowed   possibilities.'   Lacking   any   objective mechanism for making this selection, physicists have assigned this task to themselves.  Time   and   quantum   process  The model to be proposed here   is   the embodiment   of   a   process   con- ception   of nature.   By   process   I   mean   nature conceived as   a   pro- gressively growing set   of   things   that   are fixed   and   settled. This growing body   of   accumulating facts   is   considered to increase in discrete steps; at   each step some unsettled things become fixed   and   settled. Before Newton the history   of   the world could have been regarded as a growing body of facts, with the factual content   of   the region  t   <   T   representing what   is   fixed   and   settled   at   time   T,   and   the region  t   >   T   representing the realm   of   the unfixed possibilities. However, Newton's laws altered this picture: they fixed the complete space-time story, once the initial conditions were fixed. Hence the idea of process was effectively banished.   / This banishment   of   process made way for Einstein's theory of re- lativity.   For   if the entire space-time story   is   fixed,   then choices of coordinates become purely matters of scientific convenience: there   is no need for a scientist to worry   about   the questions of 'what exists now'   or   'what has already taken place.'   In   a deterministic world the whole notion of 'becoming' becomes so nebulous   and   shadowy that it drops completely   out   of   the physicist's stock   of   operative ideas. The   non-deterministic character   of   quantum   theory   reopens   the whole question of the connection   of   space   and   time to the ontological categories   of   existence, being, becoming, etc.   For   if initially unsettled things can eventually become fixed   and   settled, then the order in which different things become fixed might have conceptual   and   dynamical significance.   To   expand the structural possibilities   we   go beyond the pragmatic confines   of   Bohr's interpretation:   we   distinguish   human knowledge from general existence,   and   base physical theory   on   the latter. As   regards the relationship between order as defined by process   (i.e. the order in which things become fixed   and   settled)   and   temporal order (as defined by space-time coordination)   we   are,   ab initio,   com- pletely   free.   The theory of relativity says nothing   at   all   about   the order in which things become fixed   and   settled, because it was set in a frame- work in which no such order occurred. As   regards   causal   influences   it   now   recognized   7   that   quantum theory requires   that   what appears in one space-time region cannot in general be required to be independent   of   what   is   done   (i.e.   is   chosen) in spatially separated regions. However, this necessity for "non-local

Coherent   states   and   classical   concepts  The model to be proposed here makes essential use of the coherent states   of   the quantized electromagnetic field. These states   playa   role in   the   model   similar   to   those   played   by   the   'observer'   in   Bohr's formulation of   quantum   theory.

I shall briefly review here this connection between coherent states   and   classical   physics,   and   then   describe   some   properties   of coherent states   that   will be used in the model.   Further   details   about coherent states,   and   their uses in   quantum   electrodynamics   and   quan- tum optics, can be found in articles by Kibble   13.14   and   Glauber.   15 The classical electromagnetic field in a cavity can be decomposed into eigenmodes   i.   Each such mode has   an   eigen frequency   Wi   and   a complex amplitude   a   i(   t),   which is related to the real canonical vari- ables   qi(t)   and   Pi(t)   by the equation:  ai(t)   =   (miwiqi(t)   +   ;Pi(t))/(2hmi wJ1:  where   m   i   is   a characteristic mass.   Thus   the real   and   imaginary parts of the   complex   amplitude   ai(t)   are   associated   with   the   canonical variables   qi(t)   and   Pi(t)   respectively. The possible free motions of the classical electromagnetic field in the cavity are represented by taking each variable   a i(   t)   to be of the form:  ai(t)   =   ai   exp ( -   ;wit)  Thus, the complex variable   a   i(   t)   moves with velocity -   Wi   in a circle about   the origin in the complex plane. The real   and   imaginary parts of   a   i(   t)   correspond to the magnetic   and   electric parts of the electro- magnetic field,   and   the circular motion corresponds to the familiar oscillation of the energy of the radiation field   between the electric and   magnetic fields,   both   in the standing-wave modes,   and   in the circularly-polarized traveling-wave modes. Upon   quantization the complex amplitude   ai(t)   becomes   an   operator  Gi(t).   The operators   Gi(t)   obey the familiar   commutation   relations: Each   mode;   has a discrete set of eigenstates   In   i   >,   niE(O,   1   ...   ),   where   ni  is the number   of   photons   in mode   i.   The eigenmodes of the full elec- tromagnetic field itself are represented as products over the states   In   i   >  of the individual oscillators. One   may,   however,   consider also   the   state   la i (   t)   >   obtained   by

This result consoli- dates the close connection between coherent states   and   classical fields.  A   key   formula   for   us   will   be   the   matrix   element   between   two coherent states.

Observers   and classical   concepts  In the Bohr (Copenhagen) interpretation of   quantum   theory the ob- server plays a central role; he distinguishes between the classically dis- tinct results   of   measurements. If before the measurement the state of atomic object plus measuring device is a pure   quantum   state   t/J,   then after the measurement the state must (if the environment   is   ignored) still be a pure state. If the experiment has, for example, two possible results then this pure state   t/J'   will have two 'classically distinguishable' components, which correspond to the two distinct possible results of the experiment.   Thus   the process of measurement produces a change.  t/J   ~   t/J'   =   l<Pl>   +   1<P2> where   IqJl>   and   IqJ2>   represent   two   (non-normalized)   'classically distinguishable' results. The state   t/J'   can, however, be written in   an   infinite   number   of ways as a sum of two non-normalized vectors. So the problem   is   this:   What distinguishes this particular separation from   all   of   the other possi- bilities? In   the   Copenhagen   interpretation   this   separation   is   defined   by means of 'conditions specified by classical concepts.' These conditions are reasonably well-defined in terms of what   human   observers can see and   do,   but   they are   not   precisely defined in terms   that   are either completely compatible with   quantum   theory itself,   or   are objective in the sense   that   they   do   not   refer in any way to   human   observers. Once the decomposition of   t/J'   into its classically distinguishable components   IqJl   >   and   IqJ2   >   has been specified, then the   quantum   rules say   that   observed state will be either   IqJl>   or   1<P2>   and   that   the probability   that   it will be   !<Pl   >   is   <   qJllqJl   >,   whereas the probability that   it will be   IqJ2>   is   <   qJ21<p2   >. The idea of the present model   is   to replace the 'observer' by an objective   mechanism   based   on   coherent   states.   This   mechanism

Mechanism   of   event   generation  The mechanism   of   event generation   is   constructed as follows.   Each event   i   corresponds to the specification of the Schrodinger state vector  t/!i   on   a spacelike surface   (1i'   The region lying between   (1i-l   and   (1i   is   a cell   i   that   is   bounded in   both   time   and   space. The spatial extent   of cell   i   defines a cavity   that   specifies the modes   that   participate in the temporal development   of   the state from   (1i-l   to   (1i'  The   operator   UÂ«(1i'   (1i_l)   that   takes the   quantum   system from   (1i_l to   (1   i   can be written   4:  UÂ«(1i,(1i-l)   =   IU(P)F(P)  p  Here   P   represents a multi-particle Feynman classical path,   and   U(P)  is   a unitary   operator   that   creates from the vacuum the coherent state corresponding to the classical electromagnetic field radiated by the charged particles moving along the multi-particle set   of   classical paths  P.  The summation over all Feynman paths   P   tends to wash   out   these coherent states,   but   if there   is   a large-scale collective motion of matter then some   of   the coherent states having characteristic distances similar to those of the collective modes should remain prominent. Suppose   that   in the unitary development generated in cell   j   the coherent states in the modes iE(l, 2   ...   n)   remain prominent. Then the full Hilbert space can be separated into a product   of   two spaces, one, Sjl   corresponding to   the modes   iE(l, 2   ...   n),   and   the   other,   Sj2  corresponding to   both   the rest   of   the electromagnetic field plus the matter   fields. The coherent states are   an   overcomplete set   of   states: any state in the subspace   Sjl   can be expressed as a linear combination   of   coherent states in   Sjl'   Thus the state   t/!;   =   UÂ«(1i'   (1i-l)   t/!i-l   can be expressed as  IIA   K >   I<PK>   with   alllA   K   >   in   Silo   The corresponding density matrix  k  is   p;   =   It/!;   > Â·   <   t/!;   I   where the   dot   is   placed between a ket   and   a   bra to indicate no summation. The mechanism of event generation   is   represented as follows. Let  IA>   represent a coherent state in   Sil   (a Schrodinger state on   (1i)'  Then define:  p/A)   =   IA>   â¢   <Alp;IA>   â¢   <AI  The ith event   is   then represented by the following transformation: The probability density for this event   is:

            Light as foundation   o.f   being   265  IA   t   -   A   2   1   is   very large, then the exponential factors in   P(A),   and   the triangle inequality, ensure   that   A   will, with very high probability, lie very close to either   A   t   or   A   2.   Furthermore, the total probability   that  IA   >   I4JA>   will be approximately   IA   t > l4Jt>   is   <4Jtl4Jt>,   and   the total probability   that   IA   >   14J   A>   will be approximately   IA   2   >   14J2>   is  <   4J214J2   >.   Thus   in this case the event-generation mechanism gives results   that   conform to the Copenhagen interpretation rules. Note,   however,   that   the   mechanism   produces   a   classical   state  IA   >   14J   A>   also in the cases where   IA   t >   and   IA   2>   and   14J   1   >   and 14J2>   are   not   very different. And it gives the probability density   P(A)  also in these more complex situations where the Copenhagen rules would   not   apply. More   generally, suppose that: t/J;   =   L   IA   k>l4Jk> k  and   that   the set   of   IA   k   >   can be separated into   N   subsets such   that   all of the   IA   k   >   in each subset are far away from all   of   the   IA   k   >   in each of   the   other   subsets. This separation of the   IA   k   >   induces a separation: The event mechanism will cause the state   t/J;   to   jump   into some state t/J   i   that   is   'close' to one of the state   t/Jj.   And the total probability   that the state   t/J;   will   jump   to a state close to   t/Jj   is   <   t/Jjlt/Jj   >.   So the result   is again compatible with the Copenhagen rules,   but   more general. The essential point behind this mechanism   is   that, generally, linear combinations   of   coherent states are   not   coherent states. Consequently, for example, the second   of   the two following decompositions does not give states into which the   quantum   state   t/J;   can jump: t/J;   =   IA   t   >   l4Jt   >   +IA   2   >   14J2>  =   -![(IA   t >   +IA   2   >   )(I4Jt   >   +14J2Â»   +   (IA   t   >   -IA 2   Â»(I4Jl   >   - 14J2   > )] Thus   the special role played by coherent states in the event-generation mechanism   has   the   effect   of   specifying   very   special   modes   of de- composition   of   t/J;   into its 'classically distinct' components. To   convert the properties described above into a complete theory one needs to specify the rules for determining (statistically   at   least) the placement   of   the surfaces   (1i.   And one must specify the precise rule for identifying the subspace   Sit   associated with   (1i.   However, by introducing even   arbitrary   rules one generates   at   least a conceptual framework   for   replacing   the   human   observers   of   the   Copenhagen interpretation by   an   objective mechanism (based   on   light)   that   could give precision to the Bohm-Heisenberg idea   of   objective events as the foundation of classical reality.

Stapp  Sjl'   it   is   important   to   recognize   that   the principles   of   the theory   of relativity pertain to the general laws,   and   hence to descriptions of the  probabilities,   rather   than   the actualities: the actual situations   do   not possess the general symmetries.   Thus   one should   not   specify the sequence of   surfaces   (Ji   independently   of   the developing actual situation;   that would give preferences to certain space-time structures, independently of   the actual.

            16  The   automorphism   group   of   C   4  c.   w.   Kilmister   Gresham College, London  1   Introduction  One   of   the most pressing mathematical problems   thrown   up   by the highly   original   work   of   David   Bohm   1   is   to   construct   numerous detailed examples   that   will help in the understanding   of   the   important concepts   of   implicate   and   explicate order. Recently Bohm   and   Hiley   2 have themselves stressed the   important   role played by the Clifford algebras   C n   here,   since   the   automorphisms   of   the   (even)   Clifford algebras C 2r   are all inner   and   'any   theory based   on   an   algebra can always be   put   in   an   implicate   order   by   an   inner   automorphism   of   the algebra'3.   To   make   the   notation   precise, I   am   using C n   for the algebra generated by   n   anticommuting elements, which I usually denote by  Ei(i   =   1   ...   n),   but   in the case   of   quaternions,   C 2 ,   I use   e   1 ,   e   2 ,   and   set  e 3   =   e   1 e 2 â¢   Thus   C n   has a basis   of2 n   elements, including the unit, which I call   1.   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the algebra   is   over the field of   reals,   R.  The   simplest example   of   this   is   C   2   which, since Hamilton's original paper 4 ,   is   known   to   fit   three-dimensional   space   perfectly   (as   was intended)   and   in which the   automorphism   group   G   2   =   {T q   }:  Tq:v~   v'   =   qvq-l  is   exactly   0   +   (3),   the   proper   orthogonal   group.   This fact   is   easily proved since,   on   the one hand, for any vector (i.e. 3-vector)   v,   v 2   is minus the square   of   the magnitude   of   V,   and   is   evidently invariant under   G   2   and,   on   the other, G   2   is   evidently a 3-parameter   group   and so   is   the whole   of   0   +   (3). But it   is   to some extent a surprise,   and another   way   of   looking   at   quaternions makes it more natural. This  267

            268   C.   W.   Kilmister  will be studied in the present section. In section 2 the next case, C 4'   is introduced   and   the corresponding theorems are stated with explana- tions in section   3.   Proofs follow in section 4   and   a new geometrical picture   is   to be found in section   5.   This second aspect of quaternions was found later by Hamilton   5   and   is   developed   at   some length in his  Lectures 6   and   in his   Elements 7;   it   is   also very clearly stated by Tait 8 â¢  The method   is   to look   on   a quaternion   q   as a quotient   q   =   vu- 1   of two   3-vectors.   In   an   obvious   modification   of Hamilton's   original notation, I write: for any quaternion, with   qo   =   Sq, q   -   Sq   =   Vq   and   ij   =   Sq   -   Vq.  Here   eie   j   = -   b ij   +   f,ijkek.   Two   3-vectors   v,   u   involve 6 degrees   of freedom,   but   since both can be multiplied by the same constant with- out   affecting   q,   this number   is   reduced to   five.   Since a quaternion involves only four, there   is   some redundancy   and   this can be made explicit by asking when two quotients are equal:  q   =   vu- 1   =   V'   u,-   1  Choose any   u'   and   calculate the corresponding   v'   =   vu- 1   u',   which will usually be a quaternion,   not   a 3-vector. If it   is   to be a 3-vector, then   S.vu- 1   u'   =   0,   i.e.   S.vuu'   =   0 which implies   that   u'   must be chosen coplanar with   V,   u.   Any such choice gives a corresponding   V'.   Also, because:  Ivl   fJ   .   fJ) q   =   -   (cos   +   e   sIn  lui  where   e   is   a unit vector   and   fJ   is   the angle between   u   and   V,   any other pair   u' ,   v'   contains the same angle   fJ.   This therefore gives   rise   to Hamilton's representation of quaternions by arcs   of   great circles   on the unit sphere. Since any two great circles intersect, the product of two quaternions   q   =   vu-t,   q   1   =   Vi   U   1   -1   can always be written   as:  qql   =   (vu-   1   )(UU   1- 1 )   =   VU   1- 1  by choosing the factor   Vi   of   ql   as   u;   hence Hamilton's representation of the product of quaternions in terms of the three sides of a spherical triangle. The connection with the orthogonal group   is   then hardly surprising.  2   E-numbers  As   is   well known, the   odd   algebras present certain peculiar features which can be avoided for most purposes by noting the isomorphism:

To   fix   notation, I define the four generating elements   to   be normalised by:  EaEb   +   EbEa   =   2Y/ab  where   Y/ab   is the usual diagonal Minkowski metric tensor   and   I   adopt the   + - - -   sign convention. This normalisation   is   an   appropriate one when   E   1 ,   E   2 ,   E   3 ,   E   4   are intended to correspond to four directions in space-time. (Notice, however,   that   this   is   a different use   of   the alge- bra   from the quaternion example, since here the dimension   of   space- time   is   equal   to   the   number   of   generators.) Again to   fix   notation, I write:  EaEb   =   Y/ab   +   E   ab   , E   ab   = -   E   ba  and   E   1   E   2   E   3   E   4   =   E   s'   so   that   E~   =   -1.   Also   E   =   y/abE h,   Â£Db   =  y/acy/bd   E   cd   and   so on, and:  E   S   =   E   1   E   2   E   3   E   4   =   -E   1   E   2   E   3   E   4   =   -E s Then it   is   easy to see that:  EaEbEc   =   Y/bcEa   +   EaE bc =   Y/bcEa   +   Y/abEc   -   Y/acEb   +   f,abcdEdS   where   f,abcd   is   the   usual epsilon symbol. (Warning:   f,abcd   is   defined by raising suffixes in the usual definition, so that:   f,1234   =   -f,1234   =   -1.) The proper Lorentz   group   is now a subgroup   of   G 4   =   {T q   }: T   q:   r   ~   r'   =   qrq-l  where   q,   r   are any two elements of C 4   (or E-numbers, for short).   In fact, using the convenient notation:  r   =   r o   +   rSEs   +   ,aE a   +   ,asE as   +   trabE ab  If   we   interpret   ,a   as a   standard   space-time vector, then the   proper Lorentz   group   is   generated by the following six values of   q:  q   =   cos   ()   +   Eij   sin   (),   iJ   =   1,2,3  q   =   cosh   u   +   E   i4   sinh   u  Under   such transformations,   r   ab   is   a bivector   and   r   S ,   r   aS   are pseudo- scalar   and   pseudo-vector respectively, when improper transformations are permitted. It   is   convenient to extend Hamilton's   notation   for quaternions in an   obvious way, writing: when it also follows that:

A ratio   of   two vectors involves eight degrees   of   freedom,   of which one   is   redundant, leaving seven - far   too   few   for the sixteen   of a general   E-number,   but   we   are concerned particularly with the Lo- rentz group. This   is   a six-parameter group,   but   a   q   representing a transformation   of   the   group   may be multiplied by a constant,   making seven degrees   of   freedom. But counting degrees   of   freedom   is   only   an indication   and   in fact the situation   is   a little   more   complicated, as   we shall   see.   The   other   associated   problem   is   to   determine   which   qs  correspond   to   Lorentz transformations.   Both   of   these problems are solved by the following seven theorems, whose proofs follow in section 4. Consider first   E-numbers   of   the simple form:  q   =   s   +   tE   s   +   tl1,ab   E   ab  which evidently form a sub-algebra   of   dimension   8.   I shall call such a one   'of   bivector type'. If   we   define:  ij   =   s   +   tE   s   -   tH:   ab   E   ab  it follows   at   once that: say, where   1   1 (lV),   I   2(lv)   are the usual two invariants of the bivector   lV, defined by:  1 1 (lV)   =   tli,ab   l1'ab'   1 2   (lV)   =   tl~,abH'ab  and   It'ab   is   the   dual   bivector,   It'ab   =   tCabcdH,cd.   If   A(q)   =   B(q)   =   0,   I shall call   q singular,   otherwise non-singular. Since   E s.   commutes with  q,   it follows   that   the reciprocal   q-1   of   any non-singular   E-number   of

Then:  Theorem 1  If   q   is non-singular, it   can   be factorised uniquely in the form  q   =   qyqB'   where   qB   is   of   bivector type,   and   qy   has the form: which I shall call   'of   vector type'. (There   are   corresponding results for a factorisation as   qBqy.)  Correspondingly,   any   automorphism   can   be factorised   into   one   which transforms E   s   into   other   elements   (qy)   and   one   which leaves E   s   in- variant   (qB).   In   what   follows I shall be mainly concerned with the group   of   transformations   of   the   bivector type,   which   contains   the Lorentz   group.   The   physical   interpretation   of   the vector type   is   not completely clear.   But   some idea   of   it   can   be   obtained   by looking   at two special cases. 1   Let   q   =   1   +   u a   E   a ,   so   that   the   automorphism:  r~   r'   =   qrq-1  leaves   invariant   the   component   of   Vr   parallel   to   u a ,  and   rotates the   component   perpendicular   to   u a   into   the   part   of   Br  satisfying   pub   Ub   =   O.   The   rest   of   Br,   satisfying   rabu   b   =   0,   is   left invariant, as   are   the   components   of   the pseudo-vector perpen- dicular   to   u   a â¢   Finally, the remaining   component   of   the pseudo- vector   is   rotated   into   the pseudo-scalar, r   S â¢ 2   Similarly, if   q   =   1   +   va E as   '   the conclusions are similar, with   u,   v  interchanged   and   pub   written for   r ab .  3   Another   special case forms a warning against   too   glib   an   accep- tance   of   non-singular   qs   as all   that   concern us.   The   E-number  q   =   cos   f)   +   E   1   sin   f)   is non-singular according   to   the definition, so long as   f)   =F   n12,   and   the decomposition is trivially:  qv   =   1   +   E   1   tan   f),   qB   =   cos   f)  The   singular   case   then   gives   rIse   to   the   automorph- Ism: which   leaves   invariant   the   part   of   r   commuting   with

            The automorphism group   of C 4   273  Theorem 4  If   q   =   uv-   l ,   where   u   =   ua E a, v   =   va E a,   then:  (vava)s   = -   uav   a,   t   =   0,   w ab   =   uab   b   -   ubv   a  so   that   I   2   (w)   =   0   and   so, by theorem   3,   q   is   a Lorentz transformation. But the set   of   such   qs   has only five degrees   of freedom,   and   does not,   of   course, form a   subgroup   of   L   +.  However there   is   a   more   useful geometrical picture, which   is suggested by the following.  Theorem 5  Any   q   in   G   can   be written as   q   =   uv-   l ,   where   u,   v   are bivectors,  u   =   1uab E ab   , v   =   1   vab E ab   .  This result   is   a very direct analogy with the corresponding   quaternion result (with which, as we shall see in the next section, it   is   closely connected),   but   it does   not   help in the visualisation in space-time.   It   is more useful to consider a seven-dimensional space with homogeneous co-ordinates to represent the elements   of   G. Theorem   5   immediately suggests the question   of   which pairs   u,   v  give Lorentz transformations.   The   answer   is   provided by:  Theorem 6  uv-   l   gives a transformation   of   L   +   if,   and   only   if:  1   1   (u)   =   mIl   (v), I   2   (u)   =   mI 2   (v)  i.e.:  1 1   (u)I   2   (v)   -   I   2   (u)I   l   (v)   =   0  Of   course, even with this condition, 6   +   6 -   1 -   1   =   10,   which   is much greater   than   7,   a redundancy   of   3 being indicated - in fact very much in line with the   quaternion   case.  Theorem 7  If   uv-   1   =   U'   V'-l,   then:  v,ab   =   Pu   ab   +   Qil   ab   +   Rv   ab   +   SiJ'b  with a corresponding result for   u,ab.   There are four   parameters rather   than   three because   u,   v   may   be multiplied by a   common factor. A similar result   now   holds for multiplication to the one in the quatern- ion case;   that   is,   (uv-   1   )(U'V'-l)   =   (uv-   1   )(vv"-   1   ).

            274   C.   W.   Kilmister  4   Proofs   of   theorems  There are various ways   of   proving the results of the last section,   but perhaps the shortest   is   to recognise them as fairly direct generalisa- tions of quaternion results by means of the following (partial) iso- morphism. 1   Since   E   23   . E   31   =   E   12   and   the   symbols   anticommute   and square to   -1,   we   can take   (E   23   , E   31   , E   12   )   =   (e   1, e2' e3)   as a quaternion set. 2   Then   E   14   =   E1234E23   =   -E   5E   23   .   Since   E 5   commutes   with  e 1 ,   e 2 ,   e3   it   is   convenient to write it as   i   and   to set:  (E   14   , E   24   , E   34   )   =   (-ie   1,   -ie   2,   -ie   3)  In this notation, the bivector   part   of   an   E-number: q   =   s   +   tE   5   +   twabEab  becomes:  q   =   (s   +   it)   +   (W   23   -   iw   14   )e1   + ...  which can be seen simply as a quaternion over the complex field C   and   ij   is   then the usual conjugate quaternion. Also, as usual:  qij   =   (s   +   it)2   +   ~(",23   _   iW   14   )2  =   S2   -   t 2   +   ~Â«W23)2   _   (W   14   )2)   +   2i(st   _   ~W23W14)  =   (S2   -   t 2   +   /l(W))   +   2i(st   -   /2(W))  To   continue with this analysis: 3   Choose a generating element (the most convenient one   is   E 4 )   and set   E4   =   k.   Clearly   k   commutes with   e1, e2, e3   but   not   with   i.  Putting this in terms   of   the quaternion algebra over   C,   qk   =   kq*,  where   q*   is   the   complex   conjugate   quaternion.   Then   the   re- maining elements are given   by:  E 1, E2, E3   = -   ike 1,   -   ike2'   -   ike3   =   kie 1,   ...  E 45   =   ki E   15   , E   25   , E   35   =   -ke   1,   -ke   2,   -ke   3  Any   E-number   can therefore be written   as:  q   =   a   +   kb  where   a,   b   are complex quaternions,   and   a   is   the   part   of   q   of bivector form, whilst   b   is   the   part   involving the vector   and   pseudo-vector. The proof of theorem 1   is   then simply to notice that:  q   =   a   +   kb   =   (1   +   kba- 1   )a  and theorems 2   and   3 re-state a well-known isomorphism between the proper Lorentz group   and   complex quaternions   of   unit norm.

It   is   easier to prove theorem 4 directly,   but   in this notation it also follows easily since   q   =   (ku)(kv)   -1   where   u,   v   are physical,   and   so  q   =   -u*v-   1.   Since   ij   =   -v-   1u+, qij   =   Ivl-   2   Â·luI   2   and   since   u,   v   are physical,   lul   2   ,lvl   2   are real.   On   the other hand, theorem 5   is   much easier in the quaternion notation, since it   is   indeed the direct extension of the result of section   1 to the complex case. Here   u,   v   are general complex 3-vectors. The condition (theorem   6)   for a Lorentz trans- formation   is   lul/lvl   =   m,   a real number, so that:  1 1 (u)   -   2iI 2   (u)  1 1   (v)   -   2iI 2   (v)  is   real. Finally, in the same way as in the real case, theorem 7   is   a restatement   of:  v'   =   fv   +   gu  where   f,   g   are complex numbers.  5   Another   geometrical   picture  These results are more transparent in a different geometrical inter- pretation, in the formation   of   which I have   had   considerable assistance from   J.   A.   Tyrrell. The condition:  st   -   1 2   (w)   =   0 on   an   E-number   of   bivector type, for   the automorphism   which   it generates   to   be   a   Lorentz   transformation   has   a   ready   geometric interpretation in terms   of   the seven-dimensional projective space   V 7 of   co-ordinates: For   the condition   is   exactly   that   the point   x   lies   on   a certain quadric hypersurface,   Q,   of   rank 8   and   signature zero:  X OX 1   +   X 2 X 3   +   X 4 X S   +   X 6 X 7   =   0 Now a quadric in three dimensions contains (two systems of) gene-

A   tangent   hyperplane cuts it in a three-dimensional cone, lying therefore in the surface. Such a cone is the   join   of   a   quadric   surface   to   a   point   outside its 3-space. This   quadric has generators   and   so the cone,   and   therefore the original quadric, contains   the   planes   which   arise   from   joining   the   vertex   to   them. Finally, then, the   quadric   Q   is cut by a   tangent   hyperplane in a five- dimensional cone;   that   is, the   join   of   a four-dimensional   quadric   to   a point   not   in its 5-space. This   quadric   contains planes   and   so the cone, and   therefore   Q,   contain   solids;   that   is, three-dimensional linear spaces lying altogether in the surface. The   existence   of   these linear spaces is a new aspect   of   the Lorentz group. They are not, in general, subgroups,   though   in one   or   two well-known cases they   happen   to   be so.   For   example, the   group   of spatial rotations, generated by cos   ()   +   Â£23   sin   (),   and   similar terms in Â£31'   Â£12'   has the general member:  q   =   qo   +   q23Â£23   +   q3lÂ£3l   +   q12Â£12 or, in terms   of   the representation, it   is   the solid: Xl   =   X 3   =   X 5   =   X 7   =   0  Similarly the   group   generated by, say, terms in   Â£24'   Â£34' Â£23'   which could occur in   an   investigation   of   the electron's   Thomas   precession, is the solid: In   terms   of   this geometrical picture, consider now the expression   of   a Lorentz   transformation   q   as a ratio,   q   =   uv   -   1.   Here   u,   v   are bivectors satisfying:  II   (u)/ 2   (v)   -   1 2   (u)/ l   (v)   =   0 As bivectors,   u,v   lie in the five-dimensional subspace,   V 5'   say,  X   o   =   Xl   =   0  and   so the ratio expression represents a (many: one)   mapping   of   pairs of   points,   U,   V   in   V 5   on   to   points Q   =   Q(   U,   V)   in   V 7.   In   fact   the redundancy discussed above means   that   a solid   of   possible   Us,   each with its   appropriate   V   (and   these   Vs   also forming a solid) give the same   Q.   For   any   U   in   V 5   the   condition   on   u,v   represents a   quadric hypersurface   Q   u   on   which   V   must   lie, in   order   that   the resulting   Q  should lie   on   the   quadric   Q.   And every such   Q   u   contains planes, as noted   above   ...   and   all   of   this comes   out   of   David   Bohm's astonish- ingly fertile idea.

            17 Some   spinor   implications unfolded  F.   A.   M. Frescura   and   B.   J.   Hiley   Birkbeck College, London  1   Introduction  One   of   the   more   puzzling   features   of   contemporary   relativistic quantum   mechanics   is   the enforced retreat into the concepts   of   'ex- ternal'   and   'internal' spaces   that   are locally independent.   Here the elementary   particles   are   not   thought   of   as   extended   structures   in space-time   but   are regarded primarly as   point   objects with 'internal' variables such as spin, isospin, hypercharge, charm, etc., together with the usual 'external' space-time properties like momentum, mass, etc. This way   of   proceeding seems inescapable   and   is   forced   on   us,   not   so much by physical considerations,   but   by technical difficulties arising from the mathematics itself. Nevertheless, this   approach   has received considerable impetus with the realisation   that   the mathematical theory of fibre bundles, a theory developed for very different reasons, provides a   natural   descriptive language for these ideas. The question   of   spin   is   particularly puzzling since it arises most naturally in the Clifford algebra, a geometric algebra constructed from space-time itself.   Yet spin   is   most easily handled   through   the spin bundle which, of course, treats spin as   an   internal variable, independ- ent   of   the local space-time structure itself. Although   we   do   not deny the fruitfulness   of   this approach,   we   feel   that   it   is   worth   investigating another   which arises essentially from   an   algebraic study   of   spin. This alternative   approach   was stimulated by the general considera- tions from   David   Bohm's   notion   of   the implicate order. Consequently the ideas presented will differ in   many   respects from those used in the fibre   bundle theory even   though   there   is   a good deal   of   common ground. In fact,   we   shall be guided   at   least   part   of   the way by results obtained in   that   theory.   The   fundamental difference arises because   we 278

            Some   spinor implications unfolcfed   279  do   not give a basic role to field-in-interaction   on   a space-time mani- fold. Rather   we   start by taking the notion   of   process as fundamental; not   a   process   in   space-time,   but   a   process   from   which   we   hope eventually to abstract basic relationships   that   will allow   us   to   re- construct   our   present notions of space-time. Thus, space-time can be regarded as   an   order   of   relationships. Such   an   idea   is   not   new.   It   was proposed,   circa   seventeenth century, by Leibniz, who regarded space as the order   of   coexistence   and   time as the   order   of   succession. In relationship theory of space-time, the notion   of   locality should not   be given   a priori,   but   it too should emerge from a distinguished relationship. Bohm   1   has already indicated how this particular feature can be understood in analogy with the hologram, which stores non- locally in itself information defining local relationships.   Of   course, in this case, the notion   of   a local order   is   provided by the material object being hologrammed.   In   the more general situation that   we   are con- sidering,   however,   there   are   no   material   objects   and   therefore   no obvious notion   of   locality. The reason why there are no objects in the usual sense   is   because the fundamental   order   is   not   a regular arrange- ment   of   objects,   but   rather a process in which the objects appear as quasi-stable semi-autonomous structures. These are made manifest in the explicate order which, in some approximation, corresponds to the usual Euclidean   or   Reimanian geometry.   It   is   therefore in the explicate order that locality emerges. Any appearance   of   non-locality would then arise from the fact   that   not   all   processes can be made 'local' together. The total   order   must therefore contain within itself the re- lationship   of   locality needed to explicate this geometric order. Such a relationship will require some special principle which   is   at present unknown.   However, a similar problem arises   in Chew's   2   S-matrix approach and, as he shows in this volume, it   is   the soft photons   that provide the physical basis for such a relationship. Our   own approach does   not   use the S-matrix   but   instead   is   based on the relationship between algebras   and   the holomovement. This relationship has already been discussed in general terms by Bohm   1 and   in more detail by Frescura   and   Hiley   3,4,5.   In the more detailed papers,   we   discuss   at   length   how,   when   process   is   regarded   as   a fundamental notion, the dynamical variables must be given a primary role, while the concept of a state vector as a fundamental entity must be abandoned. This does   not   mean, however, that the state vector disappears entirely from   our   view. Rather, in all the physically relevant algebras the state vectors of the usual theory can be identified with certain special entities within the algebra itself; namely, the minimum left ideals. Thus the old state   is   now a special kind of process by which the system transforms into itself in such a way as to change none of its observed properties. In this paper   we   shall do no more   than   simply to illustrate this idea in terms of the Dirac theory. Here the state vectors of the system are

Hile}'  the   four-component   spinors   ordinarily   used in the description   of   spin one-half   fermions   and   can   be identified with   the   minimal left ideals   of the   Clifford-Dirac   algebra,   C 4 .   However,   these   ideals   are   richer structures   and   have   properties   that   go   beyond   those   of   the   ordinary spinor, a feature   that   is briefly   touched   upon   in this paper.   It   is   im- portant   to   realise   that   these ideas   can   be extended   not   only   to   higher- dimensional Clifford algebras,   but   also   to   the case   of   bosons   through what   we call the symplectic algebras. While the Clifford algebras carry the   rotational   symmetries algebraically, the symplectic algebras carry the   translation   symmetries. Our   discussion in this   paper   necessarily touches only   on   a limited aspect   of   the general   approach   outlined   above. Nevertheless, we   can throw   some   light   on   the   constraints   that   must   be   placed   on   the algebraic relations between   neighbouring   ideals in   order   to   obtain   a consistent algebraic   approach   when   curvature   is   present.   To   do   this, we   assume   an   a   priori   given   locality   relation.   But,   of   course,   our purpose   is   to   find   an   algebraic   characterisation   of   this relation   that will allow us ultimately   to   drop   the space-time scaffold   on   which the structure   was originally erected   and   replace it with a purely algebraic prescription for a   neighbourhood   relation.  2   The   spinor   structure   of   the   algebra  By the   spinor   structure   of   the   algebra   we   mean   the   reduction   of   the algebra   into   constituent   spinor   spaces.   The   Wederburn   structure theorems   guarantee   that   the algebras   of   interest   to   us are fully   re- ducible   into   spinor   structures.   The   reduction   in fact   can   be carried out   in   two   distinct ways, each   of   which   is   useful in its   own   right   and each providing a different insight   into   the   nature   of   the underlying processes which it describes. Suppose   P   is   an   irreducible   idempotent   of   the   Dirac   algebra.   Then we   can   project   out   of   the algebra   two   linear subspaces   P~   and   qrP.   If we identify the first as   the   spinor   space,   then   the second   can   be identi- fied as the space   dual   to   P~,   since we   can   define:  :pqr   x   gp~   c   C  :(PA,KP)~z  where   A,K   E   g   and   (PA)(KP)   ==   zP.  Our   first   decomposition   of   f!))   into   a   composite   of   spinor   sub- structures uses this fact in 'reverse'.

It relies   on   the fact   that   any   given primitive idempotent   P   ~   P   1   on   !/fi  can   always   be supplemented   by   three   other   primitive idempotents  P2'P   3,P 4   satisfying:  PiPj   =   bijPi  and:  P   l   +   P2   +   P3   +   P   4   =  Then   each   Pi   generates its own spin space   Si   and   dual   space   Sf,   and  !/fi   can   be written as a direct sum: or:  !/fi   =   P   1!/fi   +   P 2!/fi   +   P   3!/fi   +   P 4!/fi  This means   that   every element A   of   !/fi   can   be uniquely decomposed into   the sum   of   four   spinor   fields.   Under   normal   circumstances (action from the left by same   operator   H   in   !/fi),   these spinor fields remain uncoupled. But mixing   of   the four fields can be achieved in   more   gen- eral situations. Such mixing is   made   essential, for example, when this algebra   is   globalised in a non-flat manifold.   The   action   of   gravity may then be interpreted as a coupling   of   four fermion fields in the   manner required by this structure.   Bohm   and   Hiley   6   have used this second decomposition   of   the spinor structure   of   !/fi   in their discussion   of   a

The process of re- garding the density matrix   PAB(X,X' )   as a vector in a higher-dimensional vector space corresponds to treating it as the direct sum of four algebraic spinors. The introduction of a full set of operators   on   this higher space   is the equivalent to allowing transformations of the kind:  p'   =   APK  in   ~,   which can be considered in two parts:  pI!   =   Ap  which maintains   th~   spinor fields distinct, and:  p'   =   pl!K  which induces a mixing   of   the four fields together.  3   The   spinor   structure   in   component   form  The two spinor structures described in the last section are   not   entirely unrelated to each other, even though they look quite different   at   first sight. Their relationship   is   best understood in terms   of   a special class of basis   that   can be defined for the algebra. In the direct sum decomposition, the primitive idempotents   Pi   can be used to construct the 4   2   sub-algebras:  Pi~Pj  of   ~.   Each of these   is   non-trivial   and   so contains   at   least one non- zero element,   Eij   say. In fact, the structure   of   ~   ensures   that   we   have:  Pi~Pj   =   {)~Eij}  where   )~   is   some complex number. We can use this fact to normalise the   E   ij   chosen as bases for these algebras in such a way as to obtain:  Pi   =   E   ii   (no sum   on   i)  and: We then have: and:

            Some spinor implications unfolded   283  Thus the decomposition of   ~   into the direct sum   of   spinor spaces corresponds to choosing a matric basis for   ~.  This   same   matric   basis   determines   simultaneously   also   the   de- composition   of   ~   into a   product   of   spinor spaces.   Take   as the gene- rating idempotent   of   the ideals   ~P   and   P~   the primitive idempotent  P   l'   Then the   Pi   can   be used   on   the ideals   ~   P   1   and   P   1   ~   as projection operators which project   out   a total   of   eight one-dimensional linear subspaces.   If   we   choose from   each   of   these   subspaces   a   non-zero element,   we   can   use these   to   span each   of   these subspaces. We thus obtain a basis for each   of   the two ideals. Denote the basis   of   ~   PI   by  CA   and   that   of   Pl~   by   cA.   Then for some   AA   and   AA   in   q),   we   have:  CA   =   P   A   A   A   P   I  =).'A E   Al  and:  CA   =   P   1   A A   P A =)"A E   IB  (no sum   on   A),   and:  CACB   =   PAAAPIPIABPB  =A(A,B)E AB  The same matric basis   of   ~,   up to a multiplicative factor, thus defines also its decomposition into the   product   of   spinor spaces.  4   Reconstruction   of   the   algebra   from   a   knowledge   of the   spin   spaces  The above process can obviously be partially reversed. A matric basis  E   ij   may be constructed purely from a knowledge of the spin space   S.  Suppose   S   has a basis   CA'   Let   SD   be the linear dual   of   S   and   suppose  c A   is   the basis of   SD   dual to   e A'   i.e.:  eA(e   B)   =   b AB  Then defining:  E AB   =   CA   Q9   e B  yields in   an   obvious way the desired matric basis for   ~.   This however is   not   sufficient to allow the full reconstruction   of   ~.   What   we   have obtained   is   an   algebra isomorphic to   ~.   But how the   E AB   are related to the original generators   yll   of   ~   is   left undetermined. Now,   we   must have:

Thus there   is   some   SE~   such   that   for each   Pi:  p   l  i   =   SP   i   S-   1  Hence the two   spinor   structures   Eij   and   E '   ij   will be similarly related:  E '   ij   =   SEijS-1  This brings   out   an   important   difference between the two   spinor   de- compositions   of   ~   that   we   have   considered.   In   the   product   de- composition   of   ~: ~   =   (~P)(P~)  the   transformation   law   of   the spinors becomes:  )~   =   L(M~P)(PN~) ~  =   L(M~S   -   1   P'   S)(S   -   1   P'   SN~) ~  The   fact   that   in this decomposition the factor   SS   -1   can   be either eliminated   or   retained   without   affecting the final answer means   that we have a choice in the   transformation   law   of   the spinors   under   a change   of   generating idempotent. We   can   choose either:  t/J'   =   St/J   and   cp'   =   cpS-1  or: The   first   corresponds   to   the usual   spinor   transformation   law, with all its well-known properties.

The choice   of transformation law in this case has to   be: For   suppose   that   t/J   is   an   algebraic spinor.

This   is   rather   surprising,   but   the implications are   obvious;   the   notion   of   an   algebraic   spinor does   not   coincide exactly with the older notion   of   a spinor.   What   began as an   attempt to redefine the spinor in a   manner   more suitable to the framework of the implicate order has produced a new entity. The task   that   faces us now   is   that   of establishing precisely the overlap   and   the differences between the old notion of the spinor   and   the new,   and   what bearing this has   on   the physics   of   the fermion.   Here   we   make only a   few preliminary observations. The first   and   most striking feature   of   the algebraic spinor   is   that the   spinor   space   does   not   remain   invariant   under   a   change   of idempotent (and hence also under Lorentz transformation). This   is   in direct   contrast   to   the   spinor   space   normally   considered,   which   is defined to remain invariant under transformation by the requirement:  t/J'   =   St/J  This lack   of   invariance makes   no   difference, as   we   have noted, when bilinear invariants are constructed from the   t/J'S   in the usual way. But if   we   are to give   t/J   a meaning in its own right,   rather   than   through quadratic functions of its components, then the transformation of the spin   space   becomes   an   important   and   unavoidable   feature   of the

Let us consider   more   closely this transformation   of   the spin space. Suppose   we   vary the generating idempotent   P   infinitesimally to get  P'.   Then   writing   dP   =   P'   -   P   and   S   ~   1   +   Q   we have: dP   =   [P,QJ  Now,   P'   is   still idempotent, so:  (P   +   dP)   =   (P   +   dP)2  or, to first order: dP   =   PdP   +   dPP  From   this it follows that:  PdPP   =   (1   -   P)dP(1   -   P)   =   0  P   =   (   !Po-)   dP   =   (   ~   )  Figure   17.1   In a representation in which   P   is   diagonal, the   dP   is   anti-diagonal. [IJ [2J In   a representation in which   P   is   diagonal, this means the   dP   is   anti- diagonal, as in Figure 17.1. This can be seen explicitly from   [IJ   if   we choose   a   spinor   structure   for   ~   in   which   P   =   Ell.   Putting   Q  =   W   AB   E   AB   we   obtain:  P'   =  or: [2(a)J  P'   =   P   +   PQ   -   QP   [2(b )J The   contribution   -QP   to   dP   corresponds exactly to the usual infini- tesimal increment undergone by a spinor in such a transformation, but   the term   PQ   is   not   normally present.   It   is   this   that   takes   P'   outside the original spinor space generated by   P.   The   form   of   equation   [2J shows   that   the new spinor structure   E '   AB'   when referred to the old  EAR'   contains a mixture   of   all four original constituent spinor spaces. This mixing   is   not   a problem in a flat space-time since   we   can   use the integrability   of   the manifold   to   establish a path-independent idem- potent   transportation   law which will enable us to identify unique spin spaces   at   each point. But when the manifold   is   not   integrable, such a

            Son1e spinor implications unfolded   287  procedure   is   no   longer possible   and   the mixing   of   these fermion fields becomes   an   inescapable feature   of   the system. The   fact   that   a 'universal idempotent'   cannot   be defined in general on   a curved space-time forces   on   us yet   another   feature   not   normally present in the usual spinor theory;   we   must   allow the spinor-vector conversion factors   yJlAB   to   vary from point   to   point. This means   that the   tensor fields   constructed   from   the   t/Js   will   have   an   additional variation from   point   to point, due to the variation   of   the   yJlAB: dV   =   dVJlYJlABEAB   +   VJldYJlABEAB   +   VJl}'JlABdEAB  The   spinor structure connection coefficients   r   JlAB   CD   defined by:  dE   AB   =   rJlABcDEcDdxJl  replace the spinor connection   r   JlA B   of   the   ordinary   spinor calculus and   contain   all the information in them. Another   feature   of   the algebraic spinor   not   shared by the   ordinary spinor   is   that   not   all spinor spaces are physically equivalent.   In   the usual theory, all spinor structures are allowed, subject only to the condition that   in the representation   of   the   y Jl   generated, we have   yOt   =   yO   and  yit   =   -   yi.   This means   that   bases may be chosen for the spin space which are   not   related to each   other   by a Lorentz transformation. Yet the physics described by the spinors   is   independent   of   the structure gener- ated. This   of   course   is   due to the way   that   the spinor   is   used   and interpreted ordinarily. The   attempt   to use   an   algebraic spinor in the way suggested by Kahler, however, forces   upon   us a physical inequivalence among   the spinors   not   present in the   Dirac   theory. This   is   perhaps best illustrated by a simple example. Consider the ideal   generated   by   the   idempotent   P   =   1/2(1   +   }'s),   where  Ys   =   i}'OY1Y2Y3   and   y~   =   +   1.   This idempotent   is   not primitive   and the spinors it generates are the direct sum   of   two ordinary spinors, but   it suffices to illustrate the point in hand.   The   algebraic spinors   of the left ideal generated by   P   are defined by the requirement: If   we   write   t/J   =   S   +   V   +   B   +   T   +   P,   then   we   obtain   from [A]:  VS   =   TP  BS   =   BP  TS   =   VP  [A]  [B]  so   that   t/J   defines a 'complex'   of   anti-symmetric tensor fields whose components are restricted   a priori   by relations [B]. The   Dirac-Kahler   9  equation   for   t/J   thus   defines   the   variation   of   coupled   tensor fields satisfying [B].   The   fields in this case are obviously duals in pairs:  S   =   pYs

The essential difference between the algebraic spinor   and   the ordin- ary spinor   is   that   the algebraic spinor   is   in reality a spinor   of   rank two. This feature was forced   on   us   through   the transformation law: that   we   were forced to adopt. But this does   not   mean   that   we   are back to ordinary tensor physics.   The   point   is   that   we   have been forced to   abandon   the   notion   that   only anti-symmetric tensors   of   given rank are relevant   to   the system.   The   algebraic spinor provides a framework for coupling together tensors   of   different ranks in a simple way.   It also provides a framework in which this coupling may be altered by a continuous transformation.  ReferencÂ·es  D.

            18  All   is   flux  David Finkelstein   Georgia Institute   of   Technology  1   Introduction  Kepler   and   Einstein struggled to share in God's creative thoughts; in the early 1950s, the prevalent philosophy was more smug. The goal was a covariant renormalizable   quantum   field theory of each of the forces, analogous to   quantum   electrodynamics.   By   the time I finished school I was somewhat disheartened by the contrast between the ideal of   physics as a branch   of   philosophy, engendered by many popular accounts,   and   the   dominant   practice of specialized physics. At   about that   time, George Yevick shared with me some notes he had brought back from a stay with David Bohm, concerning a classical guiding wave theory of relativistic spinning particles. While I have reservations about   that   work, touched upon below, I still recall the stimulus I derived from it,   and   the feeling   that   I was being directed towards truly fundamental questions by it,   at   an   important   time for me. I have experienced this stimulation often with Bohm's writings.   In   several basic matters, some   of   which I touch   upon   below, Bohm has been years   or   decades ahead   of   the rest   of   us in his intuition for the proper path,   at   least in my opinion.   It   is   a pleasure to thank him for years   of enlivenment.  2   The   nature   of   physics  It   seems to me   that   Bohm's conception of the goal of physics, formu- lated in the appendix to his   book   on   relativity,l deserves more atten- tion   than   it has received. Some traditions define physics categorically; for example, as the study   of   matter   and   energy. Such definitions   do   not   keep   well.   The concept of energy   is   itself one   of   the triumphs of physics,   an   accom- 289

This   reductio   ad absurdum   makes the definition absurd.   It   is   quite possible - even likely -   that   neither   of   these formerly   popular   concepts of   matter   and   energy are   important   in the extreme conditions prevailing   at   the creation of the universe   or   in the deep core of the constituent parts of matter. So the increasingly many students of these conditions may be leaving physics behind them, according to this definition. Any definition of physics   that   itself uses a concept   of   physics may thereby limit itself to a chapter in the story.   Physics   is   too   protean   to   be pinned down neatly.   It must   be so in   order   to follow   the even more surprising transformations of   Mother   Nature. The description David Bohm gives of physics in the appendix to his  Relativity   makes physics nearly coextensive with humanity.   For   him, science   is   a mode   of   perception before it   is   a mode   of   obtaining know- ledge of the laws of nature. When I started doing physics I   thought   it was the search for the laws   of   nature, Bohm to the   contrary   notwithstanding; then, for the law of nature;   and   only quite lately have I been able to see it as a search for a perception   of   nature. The physicist forming the concept   of   the electron,   or   any   other   part of matter,   is   extending the process by which he   or   she formed the concept   of   mother; a process   of   reification followed by conservation. The law of conservation   of   matter, still asserted in the early 1900s,   is like the child's belief,   'Mommy   back soon.' This belief works in a broad   range of circumstances,   but   the maturing child eventually learns the limits   of   validity   of   this conservation law,   and   ultimately trans- cends the reification   that   precedes it. Bohm expects   that   every reifi- cation   and   every conservation law are likewise reflections of a certain calmness   of   the environment,   and   will eventually be outgrown by the maturing   human   race. Thus   Bohm   is   sure there are   no   elementary   particles   or   any   other permanent matter.   In   one of his researches he studies how cooperative vibrations   of   electrons in a gas behave like a new non-elementary particle, the plasmon. I think   that   Bohm was disappointed   that   this work was taken so literally,   and   that   he   meant   it metaphorically too; to illustrate how every particle will ultimately be found to be the re- ification of a collective vibration of still finer structures. Some have faith   that   an   ultimate law of   nature   exists.   For   example, Einstein   is   such a believer. Perhaps most of us are agnostics. Bohm   is a skeptic.   No   great Enlightenment is coming to answer all   our   ques- tions. The quest   is   endless.   Though   the laws of physics generally last longer   than   the tablets   of   Moses did, what might be called the Moses syndrome has now struck   too   consistently for physicists to ignore. Many   physicists take it for granted   that   laws are discovered today to be broken tomorrow.   Physics presently functions with many of its

            All   is   flux   291  practItIoners simultaneously seeking   and   doubting the existence of what they seek. I believe the   antinomian   position taken by Bohm yesterday will be the   common   sense tomorrow. But even if the game of nature knows no Law, physics need   not come to   an   end   but   may once again redefine itself. If there   is   no Final Answer it   is   simply because there   is   no Final Question.  3   Quantum   theory  It seems   that   Bohm became disillusioned with   quantum   theory in the course   of   writing his well-known text   2   on   the subject, in which the theory   is   stoutly upheld. According to Bohr, the language   we   use to describe   our   experiments must be classical physics, and,   at   the same time, classical physics   is   not   adequate for this purpose. We   'cannot and   should   not'   improve   our   concepts in this respect, according to Heisenberg's statement of the permanent   paradox   of   the Copenhagen interpretation   of   quantum   theory. This seems like too much protest; if   we   cannot   then the should-not is   surely otiose,   and   if   we   should   not   then   we   probably can. The ex- hortation   resembles the   'Non fingo'   of   Newton:   appropriate   in its time, but   ultimately a challenge   and   a signpost to seek further. The   path that   Bohm took, when he set   out   to cross this frontier, has remarkably old   and   honorable precedents. The idea   that   quanta   are guided by a pilot   or   ghost wave has been clearly expressed, though each time with characteristic   variations,   by   de   Broglie   before   Bohm;   by   Einstein decades before de Broglie;   and   by   Newton   centuries before Einstein. Since I have   not   seen Newton's work   on   quantum   mechanics men- tioned lately, I would like to remind us here   of   how it runs. On   the one   hand   Newton   is   an   expert in the interference of light; the interference rings between two glass surfaces still bear his name. On   the other, he   is   remarkably sure   that   light   is   a stream of particles; let us call them photons. (One wonders how he knew; the argument he gave,   that   light does   not   'bend into the shadow,' could   not   have convinced him for more   than   a minute, since it merely sets   an   upper bound   on   the wavelength. I suggest   that   the phenomenon of vision itself, combined with the kinetic theory   of   heat, makes a wave theory of   light intuitively unacceptable. Territoriality may also be   at   work: Newton ruled over the particles, Descartes over the waves; perhaps Newton made light corpuscular to make it his.) In   his   Opticks,   he proposes   that   besides photons there are guide waves, much faster   than   the photons, which   on   striking a partially reflecting surface, cause it   to   have 'fits' of easy   and   difficult transmis- sion. The same guide waves are held responsible for the   other   quantum superposition phenomena confronting Newton, such as the splitting of a polarized beam   of   photons   when it strikes a second polarizer in general position. His polarizers are 'Island crystals,' Iceland spar.   As

            292   David   Finkelstein  Einstein fits his guide waves into a unified field theory, Newton fits them into a particle theory. Each to his own. Newton's ether   is   buzzing with faster-than-light particles   and   the guide waves are density waves in this gas of invisible tachyons. Bohm's   quantum   potential is the furthest refinement of the pilot wave doctrine,   and   the cause still seems hopeless. There is first the technical many-body problem.   Each of the electrons in a   uranium atom   requires its own individual guide wave. In unified field theories, which have progressed amazingly since Einstein,   we   add   fields to go from one to many particles   (or   solitons,   or   kinks,   or   the like.) The field gets more complicated   but   still depends   on   the same three vari- ables   x,   y   and   z.   But the psi waves   of   quantum   theory combine like probabilities. They multiply, each keeping its original variables. The guide field for the electrons   of   uranium   is   a field in a space   of   thrice ninety-two coordinates. It   is   not   an   occupant of   our   time space. A second difficulty with all such programs   is   that   a   quantum   system does   not   have a unique wave-function according to   quantum   theory. At the very least, every experiment   is   symmetrically described by two wave-functions, one describing the initial preparation   of   the system and   one the final detection.   For   example, they may describe the initial polarizer   and   the final analyzer   on   an   optical bench. At any instant during the experiment   we   may equally well ascribe two wave functions to the system, by propagating the initial one forward in time   or   the final one backward. Neither is specially the property of the   quantum system. I would like to   add   some of my own thoughts   about   wave functions. To   speak   about   'the wave function of the system'   is   a syntactic error. A wave function   is   not   a property   of   the system in any classical sense, but   gives far more information   about   the experimenter.   For   example, a wave function representing vertical polarization conveys only one bit of information   about   the photon,   that   it passed through a certain tourmaline crystal in the ordinary way,   not   the extraordinary. (The number of bits   is   the logarithm of the number   of   possibilities to the base   2;   two possibilities make one bit.) But it gives infinite information, ideally,   about   the orientation angle   of   the tourmaline crystal. Indeed, the wave-function may be taken to   be   the orientation vector of the crystal. This information has no   counterpart   in classical physics, where we   imagine one complete experimental set-up capable of making all possible measurements   at   once. With only one significant choice for the experimental arrangement,   no   matter   how complex, the number of bits   is   zero. The new kind of information   about   the experimenter provided by the wave function   is   the result of complementarity, which forces us to choose which measurements   we   make. A wave-function tells us more   about   the   act   of   measurement   than   about   the result.   It   is a verb,   not   a noun; to treat it as a thing   is   a mistake in syntax.

            All   is   flux   293  of   the collapse   of   the wave function.   It   is   not   that   'the' wave function 'collapses.' It   is,   rather,   that   first   we   do   one thing,   and   then another. The   attempt   to replace a theory   of   the   quantum   kind by one of a more classical kind seems   at   odds with Bohm's Heraclitean tendencies. He has, for example, suggested a language   of   verbs. Moreover, the role   of   the law   of   nature   is   taken in   quantum   theory by a kind   of gigantic wave-function, the   Feynman   amplitude, giving a probability and   phase for each possible history. The   quantum   philosophy suggests that, being a wave function, the   Feynman   amplitude   too   is   more de- scriptive of the environment   of   the system, including the experimenter, than   of   the system;   and   thus   that   there   is   no   place in   quantum   theory for   an   absolute law   of   the classical kind. The   quantum   kind of law   is so much closer to   the lawlessness   that   Bohm sees in the   universe than   is   the classical kind,   that   one expects him to   seek still more quantum   anomalies beneath the ones   we   already know. This   is   the tendency   of   his later work   on   the foundations   of   quantum   mechanics, to which I   turn   now.  4   Quantum   time   space  Bohm may have been the first physicist to take seriously the possibility that   the world   is   not   2   continuum   but   a simplicial complex. An   n-  dimensional simplex   or   n-simplex   is   a figure defined by   n   +   1 vertices. A concrete n-simplex consists   of   the vertices   and   all the points between them in   an   n-dimensional linear space. An abstract n-simplex   is   defined merely by the vertices, which may be objects of any kind; the points 'between'   them   being   weighted   statistical   mixtures   of   the   vertices, defined by assigning a probability to each vertex with total probability 1.   A subset of the vertices   of   a simplex defines a simplex called a face of the given simplex. Finally, a simplicial complex   is   a collection of simplices intersecting only in faces of the same simplices. The operations   of   the differential   and   integral calculus, particularly the ones entering into Maxwell's equations, have exact counterparts in simplicial complexes. Moreover, one may think of a simplex as a kind   of   multiplication   of   its vertices   and   set up   an   algebraic theory of simplicial complexes which turns   out   to have   an   uncanny resemblance to the   quantum   theory   of   a Fermi-Dirac ensemble. Thus simplicial complexes may be the   natural   language for a   quantum   theory   of   time space itself. Regge's later translation of Einstein's theory of gravity into   substantially   the   same   language   has   undoubtedly   led   other physicists to take up this possibility, though Regge presents it as   an approximation technique,   not   as   an   approach   to a more exact theory. We may regard the points of the abstract simplex already described as incoherent   or   classical mixtures of the vertices,   and   introduce a quantum   simplex, whose points are coherent   quantum   superpositions of its vertices, in   order   to quantize the theory.

Most   likely, what corresponds   to   a point (or cell) of time space with all its fields   is   a simplex of the   quantum   complex; to a vector   at   a point, the product of two simplices that share a face; to a spinor   at   a   point   (paraphrasing   a   well-known   theory   of Leonard Susskind), the product of a simplex with one   of   its faces;   and   to the operation   of taking   a   derivative   (more   precisely,   a   curl,   an   anti- symmetrized derivative),   the (dual to   the)   operation   of   taking   the boundary   of   a simplex.

            19  Anholonomic   deformations   in the   ether: a   significance   for   the electrodynamic   potentials  P.   R.   Holland C.   Philippidis  1   Introduction  Institut Henri Poincare, Paris, Bristol Polytechnic  and It   is   now   generally accepted   that   the   Aharonov-Bohm   (AB) effect   1 demonstrates   that   in   quantum   mechanics   the   electromagnetic   poten- tials   All   playa   much   more   significant role   than   the   one   they   occupy in classical physics.   Wu   and   Yang   2   have   emphasized   this by   pointing out   that   while   the   field   strengths   Fill'   underdescribe   electrodynamic processes   (quantum   mechanical), the   phase   factors   exp   (ieSAlldx   ll   )   give a   more   complete   description. The   question   we wish   to   raise in this   paper   is   whether   the potentials  All   are   irrevocably   subordinated   to   Fill'   in   the   classical   domain, acquiring   an   active role   only   in   the   quantum   domain,   or   whether   they have   fundamental   significance in   both   domains.   It   seems   that   the   latter possibility   is   worth   considering seriously since in   the   AB effect   the structure   of   All   is   not   affected by   quantization.   This follows from   the fact   that   in   the   first   quantized   theory   of   a   charged   particle   in   an electromagnetic field,   the   field itself does   not   undergo   any   alteration. It   would   thus   be   surprising   if   quantization   of   the particle   trajectory alone   introduced   new   structural   properties   into   the potentials.   Rather, we feel   that   these   properties   must   be, in a   perhaps   primitive form, alread   y in existence in   the   classical regime. In   attempting   to   discover   the classical significance   of   the   All   we have   at   our   disposal several clues.   Bohm   3   has   suggested   an   analogy between the AB effect   and   the   dislocation   of   a crystal lattice.   In   this analogy   the   potentials   All   define sets   of   parallel planes which   can   be dislocated, the line integral   of   A   11   representing   the   dislocation   strength. By representing the   phase   of   the   particle wave function as a super- lattice,   Bohm   was able   to   show   how   a   dislocation   in the base lattice would   produce   AB type shifts   of   the   super-lattice. 295

            296   P.   R. Holland and   C.   Philippidis  The   close parallel between the AB effect   and   dislocation theory was later   noted   in a different context by   Kawamura 4 .   In   developing a Schrodinger   equation   for   scattering off a   dislocation   in   a   discrete lattice,   Kawamura   obtains   the same   equation   as for the AB effect   but with the dislocation strength in place   of   the flux parameter. A similar result has been found by Berry   et   al.   5,   who   show   that   the phase   of   the AB wave function exhibits singularities which   are   analogous   to   dis- locations   of   atomic   planes in crystals. Now, in   addition   to   these clues from the   quantum   theory, it has been   known   for a long time   that   there exist deep analogies between the   continuum   theory   of   dislocations   and   classical electromagnetism. Yet,   to   the   authors'   knowledge,   no   work has been   produced   which takes these analogies as a   foundation   on   which   to   build a theory   of electrodynamics. Rather, they have been   proposed   in   order   to eluci- date   dislocation   theory   by   reference   to   the   more   familiar   electro- magnetic   case.   Consequently,   the   observations   alluded   to   above, though   useful pointers   to   an   alternative   understanding   of   the relation- ship   b~tween   charges   and   fields   and   the role   of   the potentials, remain confined   to   the level   of   comparisons. We   propose   in this   paper   to develop a re-interpretation   of   the theory   of   a classical charged test- particle moving in   an   external electromagnetic field   through   the dif- ferential   geometric language   of   continuous   dislocation theory.   Our aim is   to   bring   out   the fact that, even in the classical theory, if this   is suitably formulated, the potentials have   an   important   physical signifi- cance.   In   particular   we begin   to   see why the above analogies work, although   they only have observational significance   on   the level where the phase is meaningful, In   order   to   do   this in a physically   natural   and   intuitive   manner   we make   the hypothesis   that   the   Hamilton-Jacobi   phase function   is   a real physical field   and   introduces   into   space-time a medium   (or   ether) the deformation states   of   which   are   determined directly by   AJi   (rather than   F   Jiv   ,   say).   The   appropriateness   of   this   notion   is reinforced by the fact   that   our   theory   has   the   mathematical   form   of   the   continuum theory   of   defects, in   particular   in the   appearance   of   the   anholonomic mapping   of   frames. That   the   assumption   of   an   ether   may   be   compatible   with   the principles   of   relativity was   pointed   out   by Einstein   6,   who   noted   that special relativity does   not   compel us   to   deny the existence   of   an   ether altogether, only   that   we   must   give   up   ascribing a definite state   of motion   to   it.   In   general   relativity space-time itself, insofar as it   is endowed   with   physical   dynamical   qualities,   may   be   treated   as   a medium (refraction   of   light), albeit   one   to   which the   notion   of   motion is   inapplicable (see also reference 7).   Later   Dirac   8   showed   how.   an ether   which   at   each   point   has   a distribution   of   velocities which are all equally   probable   would be consistent with relativity,   and   alternative approaches   to   the   quantum   theory by   Bohm   9   ,lo   and   Vigier   1   1.   12   have

            Anhplonomic deformations   in   the ether   297  indicated   that   a   suitably   fluctuating   ether   can   contribute   to   an understanding of the microdomain. We recall   that   much effort was expended in the nineteenth century in trying to understand electromagnetic processes in terms of stresses set up in   an   ether treated as   an   elastic solid   13.   However, what may have prevented   an   adequate ether theory being developed (aside from problems   of   invariance) was, firstly,   that   an   analogy was set up with a theory (elasticity)   too   limited in scope to deal with the complexity of the physical process and, secondly,   that   attention was fixed primarily on   the fields which tended to exclude consideration   of   particles as being relevant to the analogy. The main point   we   make in this paper   is   that   the context in which the significance of the potentials becomes manifest   is   actually   one which involves a quite different picture of electrodynamical processes to   that   of   the Maxwell-Lorentz point   of   view (for which the ether   is not   a relevant concept).   Our   method raises questions which could   not be coherently understood in the usual   approach   (e.g. electrodynamic Burgers vector)   and   forces us to   abandon   a rigid distinction between field   and   particle in favour of notions more akin to those of the whole- ness   of   the   quantum   domain.  2   The   role   of   the   frame   in   the   theory   of   deformations  It was shown in the 1950s by   Kondo   14,15,16   and   by Bilby   17.18   (see also   references   19-22 for   reviews)   that   if the   granular   structure of an   imperfect crystalline material can be neglected   and   the material approximated by a continuum, then the tensor which defines the density of   dislocation lines   is   precisely the differential-geometric torsion tensor which   is   associated with the continuum when considered as a mani- fold. Let   x   J1   ,   J.1   ==   1   ...   n,   be the holonomic co-ordinates of a material point of a continuum embedded in a space whose structure   is,   for example, Euclidean. The   a posteriori   standpoint   is   adopted   so   that   all fields are functions of the final co-ordinates of a material point   a.fter  deformations have set in (for a comparison with the   a priori   point   of view see   Kondo   23).   To   study the   nature   of the deformation   we   should note firstly   that   there   is   no invariant way of uniquely mapping the deformed state as a whole back to some perfect state from which it may be presumed to have come. Rather, following Kondo,   we   must tear from the medium a deformed element   dx   J1   ,   which   is   then allowed to relax so   that   all strains vanish   and   the element coincides with a perfect lattice. The failure   of   many   torn   local elements, so relaxed into this   'natural   state', to mesh to form a global perfect lattice   is   then a manifestation of the deformed state.   We have   now   an   amorphous collection of small pieces of perfect lattice which   cannot   be patched together to form a continuum of perfect lattice in the embedding space.

            298   P.   R. Holland   and   C.   Philippidis  Attached to each material point   is   a local tangent space with a reference-vielbein basis   of   I-forms   hi(x),   i   =   1   ...   n,   i.e.   a local perfect lattice basis. When a small element   is   torn   from its environment   and relaxed   we   have a linear Pfaffian relation: [1] . where the frame coefficients are functions of the final co-ordinates. For   the reason   just   outlined, equation   [1]   is   non-integrable   and   this 'local   natural   frame' defines a set   of   anholonomic functions. Further   details of the theory   of   defects will be introduced as   we need them. We shall now explain the relevance   of   such notions to the electrodynamics   of   a charged particle.  3   Electrodynamic   deformed   and   natural   states  In   considering electrodynamics the notions of medium   and   deformed and   natural states have to be defined in a way which   is   consistent with the physical system under discussion   and   its accepted theoretical descrip- tion.   Our   treatment   of   the ether   is   based   on   the following consideration. We start by supposing   that   the classical Hamilton-Jacobi phase function associated with the system   is   a real physical field (limit of the quantum   phase when the   quantum   potentiaI   9   ,10,11,12   vanishes)   and note   that   it defines a line element.   In   order   to study the deformation structure of this wave,   we   require for the purposes   of   comparison two space-time metrics   at   a point   24   (cf.   bimetric general relativity   25.26). Consider a flat   space-time which   is   a four-dimensional manifold whose points are labelled by holonomic world co-ordinates   x~,   f.1   =  0,1,2,3.   Such a manifold endowed with a metric   ,,~v   (a general co- ordinate version of the Minkowski metric   "ij   =   (1,   -1, -1,   -1))   will be denoted   M   4   and   this plays the role   of   an   'embedding space' for the wave. Referring to section   2,   we   suppose   that   the medium has already been   brought   to   a   state   of deformation   so   that   any   infinitesimal element   dx~   of   it   is   of   length ds   =   ("~vdx~dxV)t   since the medium inherits the metric   of   the space in which it lies.   It   is   our   task to uncover the nature of the deformation. This   we   do   by defining the natural state in terms   of   the line element: dS   =   ds   +   kA~dx~   ==   Ld2   [2]  where   L   is   the Lagrangian per unit mass of a test particle in the field  A~   in   M   4 .   (We shall   not   be concerned here with the source of   A~   or Maxwell's equations,   and   we   treat only the one-body problem.)   L   is   a homogeneous function   of   x of   degree one, given by:  L(x,x)   =   ("~vx~XV}t   +   kA~x~   [3]  where   k   =   elm   and   xl'   =   dxl'   lies in the tangent space   at   each point d)w

            Anholonomic   deformations in the ether   299  of   space-time   (2   being   an   arbitrary   parameter).   Thus   there   exists a Randers   line   element   27: [4J [6J [7J which   can   be   understood   as   arising   from   cutting   out   locally from   the deformed   medium   in   M   4   an   element   dx   Jl   and   allowing   it   to   relax, thereby   changing   its   length   from   ds   to   dS.   This   is   of   course   a fully relativistic   procedure   in   that   the   infinitesimal   time   displacement   dxo  is relaxed   concurrently   with   the   space   displacements.   Equation   [2J thus   expresses   the   elastic   properties   of   the   medium.   That   a   plastic deformation   is   also   implied   by   equation   [2J   will   be   shown   in section   4. The   functions   gJlV   represent   the   metric   associated   with   the   natural state   referred   to   the   world   frame   and   we see   that   space-time   with such   a   geometry   (denoted   F 4 )   is a   Finsler   space   28   so   that   the   metric is   a   function   of   both   particle   and   field   parameters:   gJlv(x,i).

The   relative acceleration   of   neighbouring   trajectories   in   M   4   is expressed in   F 4   by the   equation   of   geodesic deviation.

Thus   if the potentials   are   pure   gauge   (AJI   =   oJI({J   and   k   =1=   0)   so   that   the   tra- jectories   (equation   [5])   reduce   to   geodesics in   M   4   (and   gJIV   and   '1   JI   v  are 'equivalent' from this perspective) there is nevertheless a non-trivial strain   (equation   [9])   present in the medium. The   covariant   vector   P JI   =   m   VJI   in the co-tangent space associated with the   natural   state   is   given by   equation   [8]   as: [10] in accord with the usual definition   of   canonical   momentum   PJI   =   In   oa~   , x  using   equation   [3].   Note   that, unlike the case   of   a Riemanian space, one   cannot   find   at   a   point   in   F   4   normal   co-ordinates (in the sense   of Rund   28)   for which the Christoffel symbols in   equation   [6]   vanish. These symbols are   not   present solely   to   maintain   general covariance (rather   they reflect   an   absolute   property   of   the deformed ether)   and we   have   not   discovered   a   'principle   of   equivalence'   for   electro- magnetism.  4   Anholonomic   local   natural   frames  In   the   previous   section   we   have   established   that   the   notions   of deformed   and   natural   states   in   an   electrodynamic   context   arise naturally when   one   formulates the   theory   in terms   of   line elements (equation [2]).   Our   introduction   of   the   natural   state was carried   out locally by considering the deformed   and   natural   separations between two   infinitesimally   close   points.   In   order   to   examine   the   global structure   of   this state, we have   to   find   out   the   manner   in which the flat local naturalizations fail   to   fit together globally   to   form a con- tinuum.   For   this   purpose   we   require   local   natural   frames   whose distribution will determine properties like the torsion   of   the   natural state. Now, as   shown by one   of   us elsewhere   24,   the existence   of   such natural   frames   is   guaranteed   by a   structural   property   of   the Finsler

It follows from   equation   [11] that: [14J Thus   the factorization (equation [11]) of the metric introduces a field of   local Minkowskian   natural   frames given by the Pfaffian (equation [1]): so   that   the naturalized separation (equation   [4])   is   given by:  dS 2   =   Yfijhih   j  [15] [16] When the element   dx   tl   lies along the direction   ~xtl   these frames are proportional   to   u i ,   as may be verified by substituting equation [12] into   equation   [15]   to   find: [17] Equation   [17]   is   intuitively obvious in   that   u   i   is   a unit vector lying in the tangent space with metric   Yfij   at   a point in the deformed manifold, and   naturalization   merely   consists   in   'removing'   this   vector   and allowing it to relax.

These   indeter- minacies are the fundamental expression   of   the existence   of   internal deformations in the ether. It   is   well   known   14-23   that   the indefiniteness   due   to   equation   [18] is   responsible for the   curvature   of   Â£4   while the   anholonomy   of   hi   gives rise   to   torsion.   The   former is associated with defects such as disclina- tions   and   the   latter   with dislocations.   In   this article   we   shall con- centrate   on   the study   of   dislocations only by supposing   that   the affine curvature   vanishes.   This has   the effect   of   restricting the   theory by eliminating the   orientational   degrees   of   freedom implied by   equation [18];   that   is, we   fix   the relative   orientation   of   the   hi   frames   to   yield distant   parallelism in   Â£4'   choosing   to   work   with the solution   (equation [12])   to   equation   [11]. A world vector   X   Il   (x,   x)   at   a   point   in   Â£4   has a   covariant   derivative   28 (note   that   the   connection   transformation   laws given by Amari   29   do not   appear   to   be correct): [19] (d includes derivatives in   both   x   and   x.)   The   two sets   of   linear con- nection coefficients   appear   as a result   of   displacements   dx   and   dx   in both   x   and   X.   The   components   of   the world vector with respect   to   the natural   frame   at   a   point   are: [20] World   vectors   at   two neighbouring points   x   (with associated direction  ~~)   and   x   +.   dx   (with direction   x   +   dx)   are   parallel if their world scalar components   (equation   [20])   in the   natural   frames   at   the two points are equal, i.e.   if:  DX   i   ==   dX   i   =   h   i  ll   dX Il   +   dh   i  ll   X   Il   =   0   [21] Then   comparing   with the   condition   DX Il   =   0 for parallelism referred to   the world frame, we deduce   that   the connection coefficients for the natural   state represented in the world frame,   under   the imposition   of distant   parallelism, are: [22]

            Anholonomic deformations   in   the ether   303  Observe   that   Dil vu   is   a tensor   and   that   r   ll vu   does   not   transform with the usual law of connection coefficients. In   general a Finsler space has associated with it three curvature tensors. It   is   straightforward to confirm   that   these all vanish when evaluated   using   equation   [22J   and   so   parallel   displacements   are independent   of   path   30.   The torsion vector   of   F   4   on   the other   hand   is non-vanishing   and   gives rise to closure failures which   we   examine in the next section. It   follows from equations   [IIJ   and   [22J   and   the Leibnitz rule that:  Dg   llv   =   0   [23J i.e.   lengths are preserved under parallel   transport   in   F 4 ,   as   is   equation [IIJ.   The length of   an   arbitrary vector   XIl(X,   i)   in the natural state   is defined to be   (gllvXIlXV}t.

Using equation [19J with equation [22J   we   find   that   the closure fail ure   is   given by: [24J which   is   Cartan's   torsion vector generalized to a Finsler space. Despite its appearance, the object   F   U  Il   V   ==   2r   u [ll   v] given   by: [25J is   not   a world tensor, although it   is   a tensor under linear transforma- tions.   In   the case   that   hill   is   independent of   ill,   equation [25J reduces to the 'object of anholonomity', which   is   a world tensor. Noting   that dill   is   not   a   vector element,   we   see   that   equation   [24J   is   a   non- covariant   decomposition.   We   can   rewrite   h U   as   a   sum   of tensor quantities by substituting for   diu   in terms of   DiU   from equation [19J, or   in   terms   of   dx ll   if the geodesic law (equation   [6J)   is   imposed, although   we   shall   not   do   this here.

Here   we   execute an infinitesimal closed Burgers circuit   of   lattice steps in the real medium and   pursue the corresponding steps in a perfect reference lattice to discover the real Burgers vector.

Our   coefficients   of torsion   thus   describe the local density   of   lines   of   dislocation   and   their components   can   be classified   into   edge   and   screw dislocations. In   order   to   clarify fully the   nature   of   this closure failure,   and   also   to arrive   at   a correct application   of   Stokes' theorem, it   is   convenient   to take a   broader   view   and   suppose   that   the Finsler space   F 4   is   a sub- space   of   relativistic velocity phase space when the   latter   is   endowed with a suitable geometrical   structure   (which we   denote   Vg).   Let us first show   that   such a   construction   is   possible. Suppose   that   x   A   ==  (x   ll   ,   xii)   are co-ordinates in velocity phase space where   we   have written  .X-   Il   ==   x   P   and   A,B,C   ...   =   0   ...   7;   J1   =   0,1,2,3;   fi   =   4,5,6,7.   Introduce into   this space a vielbein field: [26] where   i   =   0,1,2,3;   7   =   4,5,6,7   with   inverse   hJA(X   A ).   The   covariant differential   of   a vector   X   A   in this space V g   is   given by: [27] with   dx A   =   (dx ll   ,   d.x   ll   =   dx ii   ).   If   we   suppose   V g   admits   distant parallelism then:  pABC   =   hJAaBhJc   [28]  with   aB   =   (all   a p   =   a/a.x-   Il   )   and   a   ~supertorsion'   tensor exists:  yeAB   =   hJcTJAB   =   (aAh   JB   -   aBhJA)hJc   [29]  Choose   the following form for   equation   [26]: [30] where   hill   and   hi ii   are undetermined   but   non-vanishing in general. We wish   to   show   that   in the resulting geometry the subspace   spanned   by the set   of   four V g   1-   forms   h i A   is   F 4 .   F 4   has as invariance   group   the following   co-ordinate   transformations which are a   sub-group   of   the V g   general   co-ordinate   substitutions   x A   ----+-   x A'   (x   A ): x A'   =   (x   ll   '   (x   ll   ),   (axil)   axll)i   ll   )  which yields: [31]

It   is   clear how the   apparently   distinct   distant   parallelism connections  r   Jl   va'   DJl   va   associated   with   F   4   are   actually   just   components   of   a superconnection   pABC   in a higher dimensional   non-Riemannian   space  (V s)   with   distant   parallelism.   To   complete   our   demonstration   that   F   4  is   a subspace   of   V s   under   the restriction   of   equation   [30]   we   show how the   F 4   torsion vector arises.   To   this   end   define the infinitesimal supertorsion vector in V s   to be: [34J where   b1   =   (bi,b l ).

The   geometry   V g   described   above   is   then   interpreted   as the   natural   state   of   a   deformed   eight-dimensional   continuum,   the vielbein coefficients defining   an   anholonomic   map   between deformed and   natural   states   (hI   =   hI   Adx   A ),   the   supertorsion   defining a density of   dislocations (see below), etc. We   now   discuss the   application   of   Stokes'   theorem   in the phase space ether.   Following   our   remarks   above   concerning the   Burgers circuit, we define the Burgers vector   of   the   natural   state   to   be:  B   I   =   f,~ hI   Adx   A   [37]  where   B   I   =   (Bi,B   J)   and   OL   is   the   boundary   of   a   surface   L   in   the deformed state   of   the   phase   space ether. Stokes'   theorem   then   yields:  B   I   =   L tTl   ABdxA Adx B  and   letting the circuit become infinitesimal   we   deduce   equation   [34J, showing   that   the   supertorsion   tensor   represents the density   of   dis- locations   threading   an   infinitesimal   area   in velocity   phase   space.   Note that   although   the vielbein field   may   be subject   to   local   super-Lorentz transformations   LI'I(X A )   which leave the   phase   space metric   (equation [32J) invariant, in   equation   [37J we have fixed the frame (so   that   this relation is globally   super-Lorentz   covariant   and   generally covariant). Returning   to   our   space-time   subspace   we   find   by   substituting equation   [35J in   equation   [38J,   or   using   equation   [30J in   equation [37J,   that   the   Burgers vector associated with a finite closed circuit in the deformed   ether   is   given by:  B   i   =   f~   hiJl(x,   i)dx   J1   [39J  cL  If   we utilize   the   relation   [17J we   obtain   finally for   our   electrodynamic Burgers vector: [40J Consider   the case where the Burgers vector vanishes for all circuits in phase space, i.e. the case   of   no   dislocations.

            Anholonomic deformations   in   the ether   307  i.e.   the tetrad   is   independent of the particle characteristics.   One   may show from the vanishing   of   the dislocation density   D   i   JlV   that   AJl   ==   0 or   k   ==   0   and   so the strain tensor (equation [9]) vanishes. The con- verse   is   also true, so   that   we   have the result: there are no dislocations if   and   only if there are no strains, the necessary   and   sufficient con- dition   for   this   being   AJl   ==   0   or   k   ==   O.   In   this   case   we   see   from equation [12]   that   gJlV   ==   1'1iiR   Jlh i   V   and   the   q>i   S   above are a constant translation from the global Lorentz co-ordinates   Zi.   It   is   not   possible for the ether to   support   a pure strain without a corresponding distri- bution of dislocations.   Note   that   pure gauge potentials   (AJl   ==   oJlqÂ»  therefore generate   both   kinds   of   deformation (see section   7). We make two further remarks. Firstly,   we   may deduce from con- dition [23] the following expressions for the   F 4   connection coefficients:  r   (1JlV   ==   {(J,/lv}   +   t(F(1Jlv   +   FJl(1v   +   FV (1Jl) D(1Jlv   ==   C(1JlV   +   t(D(1Jlv   -   D   VJl   (1)  where   C(1JlV   ==   ogJlv/   oi   (1   is   a totally symmetric tensor. These formulae show how the affine properties   of   the   natural   state are determined by the distribution of dislocations   and   strains. Secondly, the analysis   of this section can be   just   as readily carried   out   in   (x,   p)   phase space if we   make a Legendre transformation in the usual way. A contact tensor calculus has been developed by Yano   and   Davies   35.  7   On   the   physical   conception   of   classical   electro- dynamics   and   the   significance   of   the   potentials  We have revealed a considerable   amount   of   geometrical information which   is   latent in the Lagrangian (equation [3]). Indeed   our   approach may   be   seen   as   a   means   of bringing   out   the   significance   of the Lagrangian method, which goes deeper   than   just   the Euler-Lagrange relations. If   we   treat the Hamilton-Jacobi phase as a real field,   or   continuous medium, permeating the background space-time   M   4 ,   the presence   and interaction of field   and   particle in   M   4   may be represented   by the natural state   F   4   of   the medium. This idea makes sense since   we   have available to us two metrics   at   each space-time point which allows a comparison to be made between two states, a notion   that   is   essential to the theory   of   deformed media. We emphasize   that   it   is   not   that   the field   and   particle are in some way embedded in a medium so   that they bring   about   its deformation in a direct physical sense   but   rather that   the state of deformation   represents,   or   is   an   alternative way of thinking about, their interaction. Moreover, the deformation repre- senting the potentials only occurs if there   is   a test particle present. Conversely the test particle may also potentially be represented by a deformation,   but   only   when   the   field   is   present.   Thus,   the   actual

            308   P.   R. Holland   and   C.   Philippidis deformation   representing   AJl   depends   irreducibly   on   the presence   or absence   of   a particle   acted   on   by   the field   and   cannot be thought   of   in any other way.   It   is   in this way   that   we   treat   the interaction which in the   ordinary   theory is expressed   through   the velocity dependence   of the   Lorentz   force.   This conception is   rather   close   to   the   notion   of wholeness   introduced   by Bohr,   and   elaborated   by   Bohm   36   in terms of   real physical processes, in the   quantum   theory. Here a complete account   of   physical   phenomena   requires   not   only consideration   of   the 'observed system' (e.g. a particle)   but   also detailed knowledge   of   the environment, the 'observing   apparatus',   and   these two aspects form an   irreducible whole - it would be meaningless   to   think   of   one without reference   to   the   other.   The   implications   of   the   present   theory   for quantum   mechanics will be considered elsewhere,   but   we   consider it significant   that   our   approach   readily   generalizes   to   the   notion   of continuously dislocated   phase space, as described in section   6.   We already have built   into   our   theory therefore the idea   of   irreducible closure failures in phase space, which   may   imply a geometrical basis for the uncertainty relations.   37  On   the   level   that   is   testable   (Lorentz   force   law)   our   theory   is experimentally   indistinguishable   from   the   Maxwell-Lorentz   theory. However we have achieved   more   than   a mere mathematical rewording of   the Maxwell-Lorentz scheme. Rather, by slanting   our   perspective towards   geometry, we have   brought   to   light the following facts.  t   A new   approach   to   electrodynamics   is   possible based   on   entities  (hi)   which have   no   counterpart   in the Maxwell-Lorentz view. 2   This new viewpoint depends   on   an   irreducible coalescing   of   field and   particle   attributes   and   it   is   in this context   that   the potentials playa   central role in classical electrodynamics. The   situation   is   analogous   to   the   relation   between the causal   and Copenhagen   interpretations   of   quantum   mechanics   38,   which are   math- ematically equivalent. However, the causal   approach   is   able   to   account for   quantum   phenomena   in terms   of   real physical processes whereas the orthodox   view denies such   an   attempt. Such   an   alternative physical perspective   may   then   suggest changes in the formalism   and   hence   dom- ains where the competing theories lead   to   different predictions. We   now   examine   the   above   two   points.   The   uncovering   of   the natural   frames effectively increases the degrees   of   freedom   of   electro- dynamics.   Thus   we   may   think   of   our   scheme   as   replacing   the potentials   and   velocity by   tetrad   coefficients, the field   strengths by torsion tensors   and   the scalar electromagnetic flux integral by a vec- torial quantity, the electrodynamic Burgers vector   (equation   [40], with equation   [2J   substituted).   Correspondingly   there   is   a   change   in concept, the reduction   of   force   to   geometry entailed in the transform- ation   from   equation   [5]   to   equation   [6]   being equivalent   to   dropping Faraday's   notion   of   lines   of   force in the   background   space-time   M   4   in favour   of   the   notion   of   lines   of   dislocation in the space-time ether.

            Anholonomic deformations   in   the ether   309  Whereas we would normally think   of   FJl"   as the density   of   electro- magnetic lines   of   force threading   an   area   which a particle may traverse and   be acted upon, this idea   is   replaced by   that   of   a density   of   electro- dynamic lines   of   dislocation, which   do   not   act in the sense   of   exerting a force   on   some particle   but   whose distribution represents the particle along with the field. Identities [36] state   that   'lines   of   dislocation never end'. Each   of   the entities   of   the Maxwell-Lorentz theory   can   be obtained from   our   new functions by a kind   of   'averaging' process which yields them as a result   of   contracting the internal Lorentz index along a tangent vector. Thus:  uihi   =   dS   [41]  uihi Jl   =   uJl   +   kAJl   [42]  uiht   =   (1   +   y)-lU   Jl   [43]  uiFi Jlv   =   kFJlv   +   [1   -   (1   +   y)t]   (oJlU   V   -   OVuJl)   [44]  uiD i JlV   =   (l1   iXp   X iX   X P )-t[l   -   (1   +   y)t]   (l1   Jl   v   -   uJlu   v)   [45]  where   equation   [41]   follows   from   equation   [17],   equation   [42]   is essentially the canonical   momentum   equation   [10]   and   equation [43] follows   from   equation   [14].   Relations   [44]   and   [45]   indicate   the manner   in which   Faraday's   lines   of   force are in a sense included in our   theory   but   in a way   that   is   related   to   the particle characteristics - dislocation lines represent their presence   on   equal terms with the field. The magnitude   of   the Burgers vector measures the total   number   of lines   of   dislocation linking a surface in the space-time ether. Within the framework proposed here we have shown   that   treating the field strengths as the only physically meaningful entities would be analogous   to   attempting a description   of   a   dislocated medium   by treating its   natural   frame field as incidental.   In   reality the latter   is   the carrier   of   all the relevant structural properties.   To   bring this   out   more clearly, let us consider the classical system which   is   relevant to the experimental set-up   of   the   AB   effect.   From   the point of view   of   M   4 ,  which   we   now describe with the aid   of   a global system   of   Lorentz co- ordinates   X   Jl   (l1   Jl   v   =   (1,   -1,   -1,   -   1)),   consider   a   multiply-connected region in which   FJlv   =   0 so   that   AJl   =   oJl({J   locally.   It   follows   from equation   [5]   that   in this region the particle velocities   u   Jl   ,   i.e.   the tang- ent   vectors   in   the   deformed   state,   are   constant   along   trajectories (which,   of   course, are geodesics in   M   4   ).   From   the standpoint   of   the dislocated ether model in the   natural   state   F 4   the implications   of   these conditions are the following: the   tetrad   frame   and   metric are given by equations [12]   and   [8]   respectively, with   u   Jl   =   constant,   AJl   =   oJl({J  and   hiJl   =   <5~;   the Lorentz torsion tensor (equation [25])   is   given by:  F i JlV   =   !k(1   +   Y)   -tuP[(<5~,   -   uiuv)oJlA   p   -   (<5~   -   UiUJl)ovAp]

            310   P.   R. Holland and   C.   Philippidis  the torsion   tensor   D   i llv   is   a non-differential function   of   All   which we do   not   give;   and   there is a non-vanishing Burgers vector   (equation [39]   or   [40]). We thus have strains, dislocation densities   and   a non- vanishing Burgers vector in the   ether   where,   throughout   the relevant region in the deformed state, the potentials   are   locally   pure   gauge   and the velocities constant. This implies   that   the present   theory   considerably over-determines classical electrodynamic processes. We have shown in section 3   that the Lorentz law   may   be interpreted as a gauge-independent example of   ether   observability   through   the   strain   tensor   (equation   [9]). We might speculate   that   the structures we have revealed   may   provide a broad   enough   perspective   to   anticipate effects observable only in the quantum   domain. Also, it   is   even possible   that   there are effects which go beyond those conceivable within the   current   quantum   theory. We might suggest   that   the element in the present theory   most   relevant   to the   quantum   theory is the line integral:  f Q (x.X)h   i   /1dX/1  P(x.x)  and   that   the   Burgers   vector   (equation   [39])   may   imply   gauge- invariant   (or   even gauge-dependent) effects. This would generalize   Wu and   Yang's   2   contention   that   electromagnetism   is   a gauge-invariant manifestation   of   a non-integrable phase factor. Having   been   motivated   by the AB effect we have in this article concentrated   on   analysing the dynamics   of   a particle in a given field. We shall discuss elsewhere Maxwell's   equations   which, according   to the present   approach,   will be related   to   field   equations   in the   tetrad coefficients,   and   also   the   implications   of   relaxing   the   condition   of distant   parallelism imposed   on   F 4 ,   thus   allowing non-vanishing affine curvature.

            20  Can   biology   accommodate   laws beyond   physics?  H.   Frohlich   The University   oj   Liverpool  We   assume   that   the laws   of   physics   are   never   broken   in biology. Basic statements   beyond   physics can, therefore, be   made   only   in   situations in which physics   does   not   offer a definite answer. Such   situations   can arise in systems   that   are   far from   thermal   equilibrium, as is   the   case in active biological systems. Modern   physics offers   two   basically different possibilities.   One   is connected   with   quantum   mechanics, where individual processes   are predicted   with   certain   probabilities only.   The   other   arises   in   open systems   to   which energy is   supplied   and   where   configurations   con- nected with so called bifurcations arise where   two   or   more   possibilities for the   development   of   the   system exist. Consider   in   quantum   mechanics   the   transmission   of   a   beam   of electrons   through   a   metal   foil.   This   gives rise   to   the   well-known dif- fraction   patterns.   For   a   single electron   this   pattern   represents   the probability   of   being deflected   through   a   particular   angle.   Experimental test   of   quantum   mechanics   thus   requires   many   electrons;   the   ex- periment   with   single electrons   thus   must   be   repeated   many   times, keeping   the   general   arrangements   unchanged.   This   experiment   can   be carried   out   successfully,   although   strictly   speaking   the   arrangements will   not   remain   the   same   owing   to   their   interaction   with   the   sur- roundings.   Nevertheless   the   relevant   features,   distances,   potentials, etc.,   can   be   kept   unchanged. Consider   now, however, a biological system   and   assume   that   single processes   may   lead   to   big consequences. Assume, for instance,   that   a proton   in the   brain   has   two   possibilities for tunnelling, as a conse- quence   of   which far-reaching nerve processes   are   initiated, different for the   two   possibilities.   Quantum   mechanics, in principle,   can   predict the relative probabilities   of   the   two,   but   the   experiment   cannot   be 312

            Can biology accommodate lall's beyond physics?   313  repeated as the initial structure may have basically been changed by the nerve processes. We might now postulate   that   an   agent exists   that   influences the tunnelling probabilities.   In   the present experiment this would   not   lead to a contradiction with   quantum   mechanics as it   cannot   be repeated. If such   an   agent   would   be   assumed   to   exist,   then   one   would   be tempted, of course,   to   assume   that   it also   can   act   on   single electrons in   the   transmission   experiment   mentioned   above,   which   can   be repeated. In this case, however, the statistical predictions   of   quantum mechanics must   not   be influenced by the agent, which would require its influence to have properties   that   are non-local in time. The action of   the agent could then be described as a fluctuation   that   in the long run   is   evened   out   if the non-local property of the agent would prevent it from repetitious action.   The   agent would then influence higher-order fluctuations only   and   thus be hardly noticeable. A more radical hypothesis would restrict the possibilities   of   such   an agent to living systems only.   In   that   case one would be tempted to connect it with the possibility   of   the existence   of   free will. Experiments of a completely new type would have to be devised to establish the existence   and   properties of such a concept. This might be a task for David Bohm.

            21  Some   epistemological   issues in physics   and   biology  Robert Rosen   Dalhousie   University, HalifcLx  Madness   in   great   ones Must   not   unwatched   go.  Han1let  I   am   very pleased   to   have been invited   to   contribute   to   this Festschrift in   honor   of   David   Bohm.   Although   I have never personally   met   or corresponded   with   Dr   Bohm,   his   writings were well   known   to   me since I was a   graduate   student.   Moreover,   the   epistemological strug- gles   into   which he has been   drawn   as a theoretical physicist have their counterpart   in epistemological struggles   into   which I have been   drawn as a theoretical biologist. I   would   like   to   address   some   of   these   latter in   the   considerations   which   follow,   especially   as   they   bear   on   the material   basis   of   biological processes. The   fact   is   that   the   relation between theoretical physics   and   biology has, historically, never been close.   For   a   long   time, theoretical physics has   concerned   itself with   the   articulation   of   universal   and   general laws. From   that   perspective, biology seems limited   to   a   rather   small class   of very special systems; indeed,   inordinately   special systems. Clearly, then, organisms   were   not   the   sort   of   thing   that   physicists seeking universal principles   would   look   at.   To   a physicist,   what   makes   organisms   special is   conceived   as   a   plethora   of   constraints,   initial   conditions   and boundary   conditions   which   must   be   superimposed   upon   the   true   gen- eral   physical laws   and   which   must   be   independently   stipulated   before those   laws   bear   directly   upon   the   organic   realm. Physicists rightly felt that   the   determination   of   such   supplementary   constraints   was   not their   job.   But   no   physicist   has   ever   doubted   that,   since physics is the science   of   material   nature   in all   of   its manifestations,   the   relation   of physics   to   biology is   that   of   general   to   particular. This   view, which is a weak form   of   reductionism, is so   commonplace 314

            Some   epistemological issues   in   physics and biology   315  that   it   is   almost banal to state it explicitly.   To   suggest   that   it might not   be true   is   viewed as a retreat to the most primitive kind of vitalism or   animism. And yet, the facts are these. 1   At present, even in these days   of   'molecular biology,' there   is   not one single inferential chain which leads from anything   important in physics to anything   important   in biology, despite decades of concerted effort by some very clever people. 2   In   every   direct   confrontation   between   universal   physics   and special biology, it   is   physics which has   had   to give ground. Facts   of   this kind have led me to the position I   am   going to develop in these pages:   that   the basis   on   which theoretical physics has de- veloped for the past three centuries   is,   in   several crucial respects,   too narrow   and   that, far from being universal, the conceptual foundation of what   we   presently call theoretical physics   is   still very special; indeed, far too much so to accommodate organic phenomena (and much else besides).   That   is,   I will argue   that   it   is   physics,   and   not biology, which is   special; that, far from contemporary physics swallowing biology as the reductionists believe, biology forces   physics   to   transform itself, perhaps ultimately   out   of all present recognition. Let me give a   few   examples to illustrate the assertions made above.  1   The   open   system  Biological phenomena   of   morphogenesis, especially in embryology, but   also even   at   the molecular level, as in the folding   of   proteins into their   active   conformation,   have   always   been   deeply   troubling   to physicists. The inexorable emergence of successive waves of increas- ingly organized structures from   an   initially   rather   featureless zygote seems perversely to go 'the wrong way,'   and   flies insolently in the face of all physical intuition. Indeed, contemplation of the regulatory pro- cesses involved in even the earliest phases   of   embryonic development led the celebrated embryologist Driesch to deny   that   purely physical laws could ever comprehend them,   and   to embrace a rather vivid form of vitalism. In   the middle 1930s, von Bertalanffy   and   others noticed   that   the dynamics of open systems exhibited, of themselves, many parallels with the morphogenetic phenomena of biology. The stable steady-states of such   systems   manifested   many   inherent   regulatory   properties   (e.g. equifinality), quite different in character from   the equilibria of the closed systems which were the   habitat   of thermodynamics. In 1942, Rashevsky showed explicitly how a combination of chemical reaction and   mechanical diffusion could make a spatially homogeneous steady state   unstable; in   such   a   system, any deviation from   homogeneity would grow autocatalytically to generate spontaneously a gradient where   none   had   been   before,   something   which   absolutely   cannot happen in a closed system.   In   1952 Turing proposed   an   independent

            316   Robert Rosen  and   simpler version   of   the same basic situation.   In   the mid-1960s the physicist Prigogine,   among   others, realized how such perfectly plaus- ible   and   commonplace   physical   situations   transcended   available physical theory,   and   had   to set furiously   to   work extending the   physics  in   order   to   accommodate   them. Although the   dynamical   study   of   such   open   systems   is   presently   of great   interest   (variously   called   stability   theory,   bifurcation   theory, catastrophe   theory, etc.), the physical basis   of   the   phenomena   they manifest   is   still, in my opinion, in   an   extremely unsatisfactory state. This   is   largely because, in physics, the closed system   is   still taken as primary,   and   opening the system   is   regarded as some kind   of   per- turbation. But a closed system is, in dynamical terms, so extremely non-generic   that   there   is   not   much which can be said in general along this line.   It   seems much   more   reasonable, rather, to regard the closed system in its   proper   light, as   an   extremely degenerate case   of   open ones. But if we   do   this, all the conventional theoretical tools,   both   of thermodynamics   and   statistical mechanics, fail irretrievably,   and   we must   start   anew. So   we   see here how the most elementary situations can transcend the concerted power   of   centuries   of   accumulated physi- cal law, without being in any sense 'unphysical'   or   vitalistic. With protein folding, the situation   is   even worse because, in physical terms, the folding   of   an   initially-random polypeptide chain into   an active conformation seems to   be nothing more   than   a simple free- energy minimization. Unfortunately a typical polypeptide chain may involve hundreds   of   individual amino-acid residues,   and   each of these involves ten   atoms   or   so, so the writing   of   an   appropriate   free-energy function and, even more, its minimization,   is   technically very difficult. It   is   known,   from   denaturation-renaturation   experiments,   among other   things,   that   the free-energy surface for such a system   should   have a single deep minimum; the transition from   random   to biologically active (folded) structure   is   rather   fast   and   very accurate.   On   the   other hand,   the   more   refined   the   free-energy   computations   become,   the flatter are the surfaces so generated, with many local, shallow minima in which the structures get trapped. If this discordance   is   not   resolved, once again a   most   serious challenge will be presented,   not   to biology but   to physical theory.  2   Active   sites,   specificity,   recognition  Let us stay   at   the molecular level, for it   is   here   that   one would expect physical theory to have its   most   immediate direct impact   on   biology. And yet even here the most elementary considerations force us outside the   reach   of   the   most   powerful   theory   physics   knows -   quantum mechanics. In some   of   my own earliest published work   1   I considered the prob- lem of what the microphysical basis for specificity would have to be

In   that   work (which considered explicitly the vehicle for carrying primary   genetic information) it was straightforwardly   supposed   that such   an   information-carrying active site would consist   of   a family   of quantum-mechanical   observables   in   a   standard   way.   The   math- ematical properties   of   this family   are   constrained   by the   biological prerequisites   for   the   stability   and   accessibility   of   the   information~  basically a form   of   the   measurement   problem   with which   Dr   Bohm has dealt   at   such   great   length.   Under   these   conditions   it   turned   out that   this family   of   observables, which in   an   abstract   sense describes a perfectly   good   microphysical system, does   not   have a   Hamiltonian: hence   no   Schrodinger   equation,   no   wave   functions,   etc.   It   is   thus immune   to   study by conventional theoretical means. We may interpret the relation   of   this sub-system   of   observables   to   the entire molecule in which it   is   embedded   in the following   way~   the active site   is   an   example of   a sub-system which   is   not   physical(V.lractionahle   from the molecule. That   is,   there   is   no   physical   procedure   which   can   separate   the molecule into two   parts   or   sub-systems,   one   of   which   is   the active site   and   the other   of   which   is   'everything else'. We   can   describe the whole   nlolecule  in   standard   quantum-theoretic   terms (at least in   principle~   in   fact   I believe the hydrogen molecule   is   still technically unconquered),   but we   cannot   recover the site from this description.   In   this connection it is   ironic   to   note   that, long ago, the famous chemist Willstatter refused to   accept the   conventional   identification   of   enzyme with protein:   it was his   contention   that   protein   was simply   an   unavoidable   contami- nant   of   enzyme.   In   a   sense, the   above   considerations   support   this  view~   enzyme   is   active site,   not   entire molecule,   but   the site   is   not fractionable from the molecule in which it   is   embedded. The   idea   that   every sub-system   is   fractionable   is   basic to a   stronger form   of   reductionism   common   among   biologists (especially molecular biologists).   It   is   an   embodiment   of   an   analytical   philosophy going back   to   the idea   that   "mixtures'   or   heterogeneous phases could always be resolved   into   'pure   phases,'   and   that   the properties   of   any mixture could   be inferred from those   of   the   constituent   pure   phases. This   idea~  in the form   of   'superposition,~   survives in   an   essential way even   in modern   quantum   mechanics.   The   above   very elementary considera- tions indicate   that   it   is   generally false and, thus, theory based   upon   it is   at   best   of   circumscribed validity. Before leaving this subject, let us consider   another   of   its practical implications.   In   a certain sense, the   importance   of   a   Hamiltonian   is that, knowing it, the dynamics   of   any   arbitrary   observable   Y.   is   also known,   through   a classical   or   quantum   version   of   the relation: dex/dt   ==   [E,   ex] where   E   is the   Hamiltonian   and   [   ...   ]   is   the Poisson bracket. If there is   no   Hamiltonian,   then   the dynamics   of   arbitrary   observables   is   de- coupled from   any   a priori   principle~   in particular, there   is   no   reason

            318   Robert Rosen  any   more   to   believe   that   the observables which characterize, say, the specificity   of   an   active site are related to,   or   functions of,   any   of   the conventional observables used in physics,   or   directly measurable by means   of   the physical   instruments   we conventionally use. This point,   although   tangential   to   the considerations which follow, is   worth   pursuing   a bit further.   We   may   illustrate by means   of   a simple and   artificial example,   of   a purely classical kind.   Consider   the   Ham- iltonian:  H(x,   p)   =   p2/2m   +   kx   2   /2 i.e. the classical one-dimensional   harmonic   oscillator.   In   this situation, an   observable   u   =   u(x, p)   is   any   numerical function   of   phase. Thus,  u   =   x   5 ,   to   pick something simple   at   random,   is   an   observable.   It   in- herits   an   equation   of   motion:  du/dt   =   [E,   u]   =   5x   4   p/m =   v,   say Here   v   =   v(x, p)   =   5x   4   p/m   is   just   another   observable.   It   too   inherits an   equation   of   motion, which   can   be readily verified   to   be:  dv/dt   =   [E,   v]   =   4mv 2   /5u   +   Sku  That   is,   if we were   to   measure the observables   (u, v)   of   the   harmonic oscillator, instead   of   the conventional observables   (x, p),   we would see a very different system,   of   the form   du/dt   =   f(u,   v),   dv/dt   =   g(u,   v).  Thus, the observables   of   even   an   apparently   simple system, like the harmonic   oscillator,   can   realize   many   different   kinds   of   dynamics, depending   on   which   observables   we   interact   with.   There   are   even simple   Hamiltonian   systems which   are   universal,   in the sense   that   they possess observables which inherit   any arbitrary   prescribed dynamics (cf.   reference 2);   that   is,   among   the observables   of   such a system we can   find   anything.   Such a system possesses, in a sense,   an   infinity   of natures,   and   which   one   we see depends entirely   on   how we look   at the system. Universal systems   thus   are ready-made universal simu- lators   or   analogs. Mathematically, the above   can   be   looked   at   as simply applying some non-canonical   transformation   to   the   'true'   variables   of   phase. But   in a system like   an   organism,   or   even   an   active site, we have   no idea   of   what   the   'true'   variables are,   or   even if there are any.   The important   thing in   understanding   specificity   is   to   determine   how   the systems involved see each other,   and   there is   no   reason   to   believe   that this is simply related   to   how   we see   them   individually.   In   short, such considerations suggest   that   biological recognition mechanisms (which, as we   noted   previously, manifest a form   of   the   measurement   problem) may   involve observables quite different from those with which physics has   conventionally   dealt.   Once   again,   there   is   nothing   unphysical about   them, except   that   physics has unduly neglected them.

            Some   epistemological issues   in   physics and biology   319  3   Relational   biology  This was the name given by N. Rashevsky to a kind   of   holistic ap- proach to organisms which he initiated in the early 1950s. Rashevsky, himself trained   as   a   theoretical physicist,   had   spent   the   preceding quarter-century pioneering the idea   that   there could be a theoretical biophysics,   related   to   experimental   biology in   the   way   theoretical physics   is   related to experimental biology. He did this by constructing explicit physical model systems for biological phenomena. We have already mentioned one; his model for the   autonomous   generation of a gradient   on   the basis of reaction   and   diffusion of chemical species. This in   turn   was a corollary of his general   approach   to cytokinesis (cell division).   He   had   also developed the first workable theory of excitable tissue, culminating in the first comprehensive theory of the brain   and   of   brainlike behavior (memory, learning, discrimination,   and the like). He developed, together with his   many   students, pioneering approaches   to   the   physiology   and   architecture   of   cardiovascular dynamics, the forms   of   organisms,   and   literally dozens of   other   topics. But,   around   1950, Rashevsky himself became dissatisfied with what he was so successfully doing.   As   he himself   had   realized, somewhere along the line he was taking he   had   lost the organism.   To   get it back he recognized   that   something radical would have to be done.   What   he did, basically, was to invent a whole new   approach   to the theory of biological systems, which was the inverse   or   dual   of   the one which he had   been using as a physicist.   As   a physicist, he   had   abstracted away all organizational, integrative aspects   of   organic phenomena, leaving behind only a material system,   to   be treated in the same way as any other material system. The faith was   that   such   an   abstraction was only apparent;   that   the   organizational properties   would   re-emerge from the underlying physics. But this seemed to be   at   best only par- tially true. So Rashevsky asked, in effect, what would happen if   we   were to throwaway   the physics   and   keep only the organization. This   is   not   as strange a thing to   do   as might first appear. We recognize   an   unlimi- tedly large   number   of different kinds   of   material systems as   being organisms; between   an   amoeba   and   a man, say, there   is   hardly a molecule   in   common.   If   we   persist   in   taking   an   overly   simplistic material view,   we   must confront the basic question of how material systems of such vastly different kinds can behave so similarly, while at the same time being doomed to   do   biology   an   organism   at   a time. Similarity of organization, of function,   is   indeed   at   the root of what we   really want to know   and   understand   about   organisms, as it   is   at the basis of   our   deeply-held conviction   that   we   can recognize   an   organ- ism when   we   see one. This subjective conviction   is   what underlies biology as a separate science,   and   it has always resisted a facile re- ductionistic characterization.   That   is   why all attempts to 'define life'

            320   Robert Rosen  have failed,   and   that   is   how   we   know   that   they have failed. So what Rashevsky   sought   was   a   kind   of   universal   bauplan   of functional organization, which must be manifested by anything   we   would want to call   an   organism,   but   which could be executed concretely,   or   physic- ally, in many different ways. Thus, instead   of   starting with a particular organism as a material system   and   trying to discover its organization from   its   physics,   Rashevsky   suggested   starting   with   an   abstract organization,   and   recovering the physics   through   material   realizations  of this organization.   That   was what he called relational biology. Behind these   apparent   simplicities lies a plethora of the deepest   and most profound epistemological questions. Starting from a conviction that   relational descriptions of organisms are equally valid,   and   equally real, as conventional physical ones, the fundamental problem was how to fit the two together.   By   their very nature, relational descriptions fall outside conventional physics. So once again, in a different way from before,   we   find   that   the most elementary biological considera- tions force   us to   do   things   that   physics has never done,   and   thus cannot   provide the merest hint how   to   proceed. Indeed, it \vas the attempt   to provide a material basis for my own early work in rela- tional cell models   that   forced me to confront epistemological problems of   this kind.   More   than   that, it forced me to the conviction which I have tried to motivate above;   that   biology has infinitely more to tell the physicist   than   physics presently has to tell the biologists.   In   the remaining pages, I will try to sketch a   few   of   these things. I have stated above that, in my opinion, the conceptual framework within which physics has historically developed   is   too   narrow   to ac- commodate organic phenomena. Indeed, it   is   inadequate in several distinct   and   independent ways. I shall briefly discuss two of them; the first, while   of   basic importance,   is   not   truly radical; the second   is   both important   and   radical. Both   of   the problems I shall discuss go to the very heart of theo- retical science.   No   one, be he observer, experimentalist,   or   theoretician, can   do   science   at   all without some conviction   that   natural   phenomena are orderly;   that   they obey laws which can be,   at   least in part, arti- culated   and   grasped   by the intellect. This   basic belief   is   generally summed up in a single word:   causality.   But there   is   more to it   than this.   In   brief, we also believe   that   this   causal   order   relating events in the external world can be imaged formally, in terms of purely   logical  relationships   between   propositions describing   these events.   Indeed, this   is   precisely what   'natural   law' means;   that   causal relations in the external world   can   be made to correspond precisely to implications in some   appropriate   logical (i.e. mathematical) system. Attention   is   thus   drawn   to   the logical   or   mathematical systems which can image events in the external world. It   is   the main task of theoretical science to construct   and   interrogate such images. The deep- est parts of theoretical science are all concerned,   at   root, with the

The   thrust   of mechanics, either classical   or   quantum,   is   to   construct canonically such classes   of   images,   and   to establish   homomorphisms   between them which are mainly interpreted reductionalistically.   On   the   other   hand, the thrust   of   the laws   of   thermodynamics,   or   of   relativity,   is   to cir- cumscribe the class   of   mathematical systems which   can   be images   of physical reality. The   most   familiar kind   of   mathematical image   of   physical events   is that   of a mathematical function   or   relation involving a sequence   of arguments   belonging   to   some manifold   or   set.   Let   me consider   a particular example, which clearly illustrates the points I wish to make; the relation:  (p   +   a/v   2 )   (v   -   b)   =   rT  This   is   an   equation   of   state   describing the equilibrium points of a class of   non-ideal gases (the van   der   Waals equations). Here   p,   v,   T   are the state variables   of   the gas (pressure, volume, temperature),   and   a,   b,   r  are parameters. Mathematically, this   is   a single relationship:  <D(p,   v,   T,   a,   b,   r)   =   0  among   six arguments. There   is   thus nothing available mathematically to distinguish any   of   these arguments from any other; the distinction we   have informally   drawn   between state variables   and   parameters has no   mathematical counterpart. And yet, intuitively, there   is   the greatest possible distinction between them; the parameters determine for us the   species   of   gas we are dealing with, while the state variables deter- mine the 'secular' features which this species manifests under given conditions. Even   the   state   variables   must   be   given   differing   interpretations. Basically, the van   der   Waals   equation   says   that   if two   of   them   (p,   T,  say) are specified, then   at   equilibrium the volume   v   is   determined thereby. But these values of   p,   T   are set by the   nature   of   the external world; they are determined by processes which   do   not   obey the law (i.e. the van der Waals equation) governing the system itself. Thus, their values are determined,   not   by the system law,   but   by the system  environment.   Once these are set, the law says that,   at   equilibrium, the remaining argument   v   must have the value   mandated   by the law. Thus   we   have partitioned the undifferentiated arguments of the van der Waals   equation   into three utterly distinct classes: 1   the system   genome (a,   b,   r);  2   the system   environment (p, T);  3   the system   phenotype   (v).  I have deliberately chosen this   rather   provocative terminology to sug- gest a biological parallel I wish to stress.   .

            322   Robert Rosen  As   noted previously, the above distinctions disappear if   we   interpret the van der Waals equation simply as a mathematical relation in- volving six arguments. The mathematics has abstracted away these distinctions   and,   to   recapture   them,   we   must   augment   the   math- ematics. We will   do   this in two stages. First, let us rewrite the van der Waals equation, formally, as:  <I> abr(P,   V,   T)   =   0  This   is   now a three-parameter family   of   relations, each involving three arguments.   The   distinction   we   have   informally   drawn   between parameters   and   state   variables   is   now   reflected   mathematically   as follows: the parameters   a,   b,   r   now act as   coordinates   in   a function space;   they identify   or   pick   out   a particular function from a family of functions. The state variables are now the   common   arguments of the functions   of   this family. The distinction between environment   and   phenotype must now be embodied mathematically.   We will   do   this   by   rewriting the   three- parameter   family   of   relations as a genome-parameterized family of mappings   from   environments to phenotypes:  <I> abr   :   (p,   T)   ---+   (v)  We claim   3   that   every linkage   between   physical   observables, every equation of state,   can   (and in fact must) be written in this way. The apparently straightforward rewriting   we   have exemplified with the van der Waals equation   is   far from trivial, either mathematically or   epistemologically.   From   the   mathematical   standpoint,   we   have turned   the   arena   of   discourse   from   a   six-manifold   into   a   more structured mathematical object; something like a fiber space (for the van der Waals equation, exactly a fiber space) with a base space of genomes,   and   a   fiber   of state   variables.   In   our   special   case,   the equation of state (i.e. the van der Waals equation) defines a family   of cross-sections which, physically, are   corresponding states   for every differ- ent species of gas;   we   have shown elsewhere how general questions of similarity   and   scaling are posed in terms of the stability   of   the genome- parameterized family   {<I> abr},   and   how they bear   on   major biological problems   of   evolution   and   development,   but   we   cannot   touch   on   this matter   here. Epistemologically, there are two issues raised by the above considera- tions.   First, the   rewriting shows explicitly   that   we   never construct mathematical images   of   single systems,   but   of classes   or   families of systems, with the same states   but   different genomes.   For   each indi- vidual system in the class, the entire class creates a   context;   different ways of embedding a single system into such a class create different such contexts.   By   concentrating   on   individual systems   and   forgetting the context, the mathematical images   we   have been using have become too   abstract; they have neglected   or   forgotten certain crucial features

            Some epistemological issues   in   physics and biology   323  of physical reality. By considering a system devoid   of   any particular context,   we   have in effect identified such a system with a whole class of contexts; in mathematical terms,   we   have identified a space of states with the class of all fiber spaces   of   which it can be a fiber. Naturally, much   is   lost in this process. Let us see exactly what   is   lost. The partition of the arguments of   an equation   of   state into genome, environment   and   phenotype turns   out   3 to be closely related to the old Aristotelian categories   of   causation; genome can be identified with   formal   cause,   environment with   efficient cause,   and   state itself with   material cause.   These categories are distinct and   non-interchangeable; neglect of this fact has been responsible for endless mischief in theoretical biology   and   elsewhere.   Our   rewriting, then, serves to re-introduce a definite causal structure into the math- ematical description   of   a system; a causal structure which disappears when   we   revert to the   standard   description.   That   is,   our   familiar way of   describing physical reality in terms of relations   on   manifolds uses the same mathematical object to describe distinct systems of entirely different   causal   structures;   it   cannot   therefore   discriminate   these structures. This   is   just   another   way of saying   that   the old language can only describe equivalence classes   and   that, to   probe   these equi- valence classes,   we   must introduce more mathematical structure from the outset; change   our   epistemology   at   the very root. Let us give a single illustration of the importance   of   making these causal distinctions.   In   his attempts to construct a 'self-reproducing automaton,'   von   Neumann   4   argued that, because a universal com- puting machine must exist   5,   a universal   constructor   must also exist. Basically,   his   argument   was   that   since   construction   (following   a blueprint)   and   computation   (following a program) are   both   algor- ithmic processes, whatever   is   true for   computation   must be true for construction. However, in the terminology   we   have been using, it   is not   hard   to   show   that   computation   involves   efficient   cause,   while construction (if it   is   to mean anything   at   all) involves   material   cause. The   inequivalence   of   the   categories   of   causation   invalidates   this argument,   and   indeed makes it very risky to extrapolate from com- puter models to anything in biological development   or   evolution (as is   often done). We may note a parallel between the considerations sketched above, and   the idea   of   'hidden variables' in   quantum   theory. Essentially,   both argue   that   a   certain   level   of mathematical description   of physical reality only characterizes equivalence classes.   In   our   case, however, what   is   needed to penetrate the classes   is   more mathematical structure, not   more variables. The above considerations are important, in my opinion,   but   not truly radical.   In   my concluding remarks I will in fact suggest some- thing which   is   radical indeed. Once again, I will be concerned with the class of mathematical   or   formal systems which   can   be images of

At the moment, every mode of system description which   we   possess in physics, biology,   human   sciences, technology,   or   anywhere else,   is at   heart the same as the one which   Newton   propounded   in the seven- teenth   century.   However much   these   modes   of system   description differ   technically   among   themselves,   they   all   share   a   fundamental dualism, which   can   be   thought   of as a separation between   states   and  dynamical laws.   In   some sense, the states represent what   is   intrinsic about   a system, while the dynamical laws reflect the effects of what   is outside   or   external. In   terms   of   the Aristotelian categories   of   causation, which   were mentioned   earlier,   the   separation   into   states   and   dynamical   laws amounts   to a corresponding segregation   of   causal categories. This state, which as   we   have argued, corresponds to material causation,   is partitioned off as   an   independent chunk from formal   and   efficient cause; if   we   look more closely   at   the concept   of   dynamical law,   we   will see that   in writing equations of   motion   the categories of formal   and   effi- cient cause are likewise fractionated from each other. I would in fact argue   that   the paradigm of system description which   we   inherit essen- tially unchanged from Newtonian times   is   at   heart precisely this:   that  each category   of   causation   is   reflected   in   a logically independent aspect of   systen1 description.  It has always been taken as absolutely axiomatic   that   systems must necessarily be described in a dualistic language   of   states plus dynami- cal laws. However, when this axiom   is   expressed as in the preceding paragraph, in terms   of   the independence it imposes   on   the categories of causation, it perhaps   no   longer appears so self-evident. I would like to suggest   that   the class of material systems which can be described in this way is in fact a limited class, which I have called the class of   simple systems,   or   mechanisms.   Thus, in this language, a simple system is one to which a notion of state can be assigned once and   for all;   or   more generally, one in which the Aristotelian causal categories can be independently segregated from   one another. Any system for which such a description   cannot   be provided I will call  complex.   Thus, in a complex system, the causal categories become intertwined, in such a way   that   no   dualistic language of states plus dynamical laws can completely describe it. Complex systems must then possess mathematical images different from,   and   irreducible to, the generalized dynamical systems which have been considered universal. Let me briefly suggest a candidate for such a language, originally suggested by   an   attempt   to provide a physical basis for certain ideas of biological information (for fuller details,   cf.   reference   6)   using con- cepts of stability. Suppose for the sake of argument   we   are given a dynamical system description of the form:

            Some   epistemological issues   in   physics   and   biology   325  where the   Xi   are state variables, the   Cl.   j   are parameters.   From   these,   we can   form the observables: If this   quantity   is   positive in a given state, it means   that   a (virtual) increase in   x   j   will increase the rate   of   change   of   Xi   (or   equivalently, that   a virtual decrease in   Xj   will decrease the rate   of   change   of   x;).   It thus makes sense   to   say   that   x   j   activates   Xi   in the given state. Like- wise, if   uij   is   negative in a state, we   can   say   that   x   j   inhibits   Xi   in   that state. We   can   form   analogous   quantities using the   parameters   as well, but   we will   omit   this for the time being. The   n   2   functions   uij   constitute   what   I have called   an   activation- inhibition   pattern.   The   terminology   suggests   an   intrinsically   in- formational significance for these quantities;   at   the same time, they are closely related   to   the stability properties   of   the dynamical system from which they came.   The   question we   may   pose now   is:   suppose   we know   the quantities   uij;   that   is,   suppose we   know   the pairwise in- formational   interactions   between   the   state   variables   which   these quantities   represent.   Can   we   reconstruct   the   dynamical   equations themselves? The   way to   do   this   is   obviously   to   construct   differential forms:  n  L   uijdx   j  j=l  For   each   i,   this form   must   be   qj;,   the differential   of   velocity   or   rate   of change   of   the   state   variable   X k.   Thus   we   recapture   the   original dynamics by putting}; equal   to   dxddt.  However, this works only if the differential form   qj;   is   exact. And exactness   is   a highly non-generic situation.   By   presupposing   that   we must always   start   with states plus dynamical laws,   we   place   an   in- credibly severe restriction   on   what   an   activation-inhibition   pattern can be. The   necessary conditions for exactness   of   the differential forms   qf~  are: Now   a   quantity   like   a/axk(uij)   also has   an   informational significance; it represents the effect   of   a (virtual) change in   X   k   on   the degree to which   Xj   activates   or   inhibits   Xi;   that   is,   it expresses the degree to which   X   k agonizes   or   antagonizes   the effect   of   x   j   on   X   k.   In   this language, the   conditions   for   exactness   of   d};   become:   the   agonist-antagonist relation   and   the   activator-inhibitor   relation are interchangeable   or symmetric   or   commutative.   Once   again, this   is   a   most   non-generic situation. Thus, if we characterize a system in terms   of   its informa-

By   iterating considerations   of   this type,   we   can   provide a new class of candidates for the mathematical images   of   physical reality, which contain the conventional dynamical systems as a very special case. There are   good   reasons for believing   that   many   material systems have images in this extended class,   and   are hence   complex.   From   this per- spective, what we now call physics is seen as the special situation it   is; it   is   the science   of   simple systems   or   mechanisms. There are   many   corollaries   of   adopting   this   point   of   view. Let us mention a   few   of   them. 1   Traditional modes   of   reductionism,   or   of   mathematical modelling of   biological activities, have   among   other   things the effect   of   re- placing a putatively complex system by a simple sub-system. It can be shown, using the above considerations,   that   a complex system   describable   by   a   web   of   informational   interactions   as above   can   be approximated,   but   only locally   and   temporarily, by such a simple system. Indeed, this   is   apparently why   we   have been able to   do   so much science in the conventional dynamical frame- work. But as   we   watch a complex system over long times,   our approximating   simple   systems   become   increasingly   inadequate. Depending   on   the circumstances, this appears to us as emergence, or   error,   or   a variety of   other   similar   phenomena   traditionally associated with complexity. 2   If organisms, say, are in fact complex systems,   and   if physics   is   in fact the science   of   simple systems, it follows   that   the relation   of physics to biology   is   not   that   of   general to particular. This re- inforces   the   point   made   earlier;   that   to   encompass   organic phenomena it   is   physics which will have   to   be modified, perhaps in ways even   more   radical   than   can   now be imagined. Indeed, one can even question whether there are any simple systems   at   all; if there are not, then   our   traditional universals evaporate entirely. 3   Complex   systems   can   allow   a   meaningful,   scientifically   sound category   of   final   causation; something which   is   absolutely for- bidden within the class   of   simple systems.   In   particular, complex systems may   contain   sub-systems which act as predictive models of themselves   and/or   their environments, whose predictions re- garding future behaviors   can   be utilized for   modulation   of pres- ent change of state. Systems   of   this type act in a truly anticipatory fashion,   and   possess   many   novel   properties   7   whose   properties have never been explored. My   intention, in the above discussion, has been to give some idea   of the epistemological issues raised when   we   consider seriously how to attack the material basis   of   organic phenomena. I have tried to touch on   a great   many   issues in a   short   space. I hope   that   the resultant

            22  A science   of   qualities  B. C. Goodwin   The Open Universi(v, Milton Keynes,   UK  This work did   not   belong to the class of austere, strictly objective enquiry; it was   of   that   fantastical kind which often gropes far ahead into the future   and   which originates in some stimulus outside the scope of everyday scientific activity. However, it was built   on   sound foundations   and   there was much plausibility in its deductions, which pointed to there being a unity of experience hidden behind the ultimate nebulosity of   our   feeling   and perception. ROBERT MUSIL,   The Man Without Qualities  Introduction  One   of the more curious aspects of the history of Western science   is that   the   dominant   scientific   world-view   of   the   sixteenth   century assumed a deep unity between nature   and   gnosis (knowledge), hidden but   accessible   to   imaginative   thought   and   feeling;   whereas   what emerged in the seventeenth century was a science based   upon   a pro- found division between mind   and   the nature it contemplates, so   that an   "ontological gulf exists between consciousness   and   its object such that   the real   is,   for the mind   that   relates to it cognitively, truly   an object,   that   which stands over against the thinking mind, appearing   to  it   but   not   in   it'   1.   This dramatic change   of   perception emerged from a fierce   and   fateful   struggle   for   legitimacy   and   power   between   the members of groups championing radically different programmes of development   and   reform in Europe   at   the end of the sixteenth   and   the beginning   of the   seventeenth   century.   Francis   Yates   identified   the monk   Mersenne as a key figure in the demise of what he saw as a threatening, reforming   and   transforming Renaissance conception of 328

            A science   of   qualities   329  the   cosmos:   'Mersenne   attacks   and   discards   the   old   Renaissance world; his Universal   Harmony   will have   nothing   to   do   with Francesco Giorgi,   of   whom he strongly disapproves'   2.   Giorgi, the   Franciscan friar whose   De harmonica mundi   of   1525   had   incorporated   the unifying themes   of   the thirteenth-century philosopher   and   mystic,   Ramon   Lull, was one   of   the   major   figures in developing   and   articulating the tra- dition   of   Renaissance   nature   philosophy. Within this tradition, 'all   of reality was a single co-ordinated domain, every region   of   which was intrinsically related   to   every   other   region, so   that   to   know the region called   nature   entailed knowing the whole sphere   of   Being within which nature   was embedded'   1.   Furthermore,   this union   of   the knower   and the   known   had   the consequence   that   a change in one resulted in a co- ordinated   change in the other, mind   and   nature   therefore undergoing a co-operative   transformation.   But   to   achieve   this   knowledge   and insight, the seeker   had   to   make   a commitment   to   spiritual enlightenment so as   to   experience gnosis, knowledge   that   transforms   both   self   and other, mind   and   nature   then   simultaneously changing to   states of greater   harmony   and   unity.   In   alchemy, this   dual   transformation was described as golden illumination for the mind   (or   soul)   of   the practi- tioner   of   the art; while gold emerged in the crucible,   nature   undergoing simultaneous   transmutation   with spiritual illumination. Neither could occur without the other. It   was   to   this process   of   unified   and   unifying change   that   the Re- naissance magi such as Francesco Giorgi,   Johannes   Reuchlin,   John Dee   and   Giordano   Bruno   were committed in their science; while in social   and   political action, it involved them in commitment to radical change   and   reform. Mersenne correctly perceived this powerful six- teenth-century movement as a   threat   to   what   he considered to be the path   of   intellectual   and   political rectitude   and   stability. The science which he helped   to   shape in the seventeenth century,   and   which has come   down   to   us as the   dominant   tradition   of   Western scientific   and philosophical thought, is based   upon   dualisms which split the unified world   of   the Renaissance magi   into   separate domains   of   power, par- ticularly   that   between   mind   and   nature,   and   the   threads   of these dualisms   can   be found running   through   individual sciences as well as through   our   social   and   political structures.   The   struggle for unification continues   against   the   power   of   established   interests   and   habits   of mind. I tend to see   David   Bohm's efforts to bring intelligibility   and experiential   unity   into   physics   as   a   part   of   this   struggle;   and   his intellectual   and   spiritual   vision   continues   the   tradition   of   the   Re- naissance magi, a   tradition   that   has never died despite the   apparent victory   of   Mersenne   and   Bacon in the seventeenth century.   In   this essay I shall briefly describe the roots   and   the   main   characteristics of this tradition, following closely Frances Yates' lucid   and   illuminating treatment   2,   and   the ways in which it still lives in biology, where it continues   to   challenge received dualist wisdom.

The   science   of   union  The   Catalan   philosopher   and   mystic~   Ramon   Lull (1232-1316) worked out   a theory   and   practice   of   astral science   and   medicine which was based   upon   common   components   of   the three   dominant   cultures   of thirteenth-century   Iberia   -   Moslem~   Jewish   and   Christian.   The common   scientific principle was the theory   of   the elements (earth.   air~ fire~   water)   on   which he based   an   astral science   of   correspondence between different levels   of   being -   terrestriat   celestial   and   super-cel- estial. These were linked   by   their   possession   of   similar elementary  properties~   developed in the principle   of   correspondences such   that the   near   and   the   far~   and   three levels   of   being~   were united by virtue of   sharing basic characteristics.   However~   Lull rejected the one-way determinism   of   astrology~   for his system involved active participation by the   practitioner   of   his   art   in   mounting   the   ladder   of   creation   to~ potentially~   the greatest heights   of   insight   and   knowledge. Here was an   early articulation   of   what   was later expressed in the Renaissance as the miracle   of   humanity~   capable   of   prodigious development within the   appropriate   context   of   ethical   and   intellectual effort.   The   religious basis   of   the   art   was also   common   to   the three religious   traditions~  namely the nine divine   attributes   or   dignities   of   God:   honitos   (good-  ness)~   n1agnitudo   (greatness)~   eternitas   (eternity)~   potestas   (power)~  sapientia   (wisdom)~   etc.   To   these   Lull assigned   letters~   A being the ineffable   absolute~   while B to K (without J) signified the nine manifest qualities. Since   God~s   attributes   are manifest   on   all levels   of   creation~  we have here   another   unifying principle which allowed the practitioner to   ascend   and   descend with the letters   of   the   art   throughout   the uni- verse.   Lull linked the elements, designated   ABCD~   to the letters   of the   attributes~   suggesting a kind   of   algebra which was connected also to a symbolic geometry in the form   of   triangle~   circle   and   square   for each   of   the levels   of   being, from   top   (super-celestial)   to   bottom   (terres- trial), respectively. These   abstract   symbols assist the artist in moving through   the complex levels   of   being   and   organization   which are   to   be explored   and   experienced   through   a   contemplative   method   which owes   much   to   the mystical   traditions   associated   with   the   different religions, particularly Sufism (Moslem)   and   cabala   (Jewish).   What   Lull created was a   remarkable   culturally synthetic   art-science~   a precursor of   scientific   method   which   had   an   immense influence in   Europe   for centuries.   It   was   a   major   stimulus   to   the   great   radical~   reforming movements   of   the Renaissance. One   of   the earliest manifestations   of   this influence   appeared   in the brilliant circle associated with the Medici   court   in   Florence~   where what   is   known   as Renaissance neoplatonism was developed.

            A science   of   qualities   331  a   synthetic   product   of   ancient   wisdom   and   modern   insight   which incorporated   both   hermetic   and   cabalistic teaching.   The   great   German humanist,   Johannes   Reuchlin (1455-1522), also   known   as   Capnion, travelled in Italy as a   young   man   and   absorbed   this teaching, de- veloping it in his   most   famous work,   De arte cabalistica   (1517), the first full cabalist treatise by a non-Jew.   It   takes the form   of   a conversa- tion between a   Pythagorean,   Philolaus, a Moslem,   Marranus,   and   a cabalist, Simon   ben   Elieser,   who   meet in   an   inn   in   Frankfurt.   From their discussion emerges a synthesis   of   cabalistic numerology, Pyth- agorean   mathematics,   and   Moslem mysticism,   a   structure   allowing the discovery   of   all   that   can   be   known   which aids the co-operative transformation   of   mind   and   nature. However, social   and   cultural synthesis is   not   so easily achieved as synthetic vision.   The   growth   of   Catholic   power   in Iberia in the   fif- teenth century led   to   a simpler form   of   religious unity   than   that   en- visioned by Lull, with the expulsion   of   the Jews in 1492   and   of   the Moors   in 1505.   And   Reuchlin was the focus   of   a fierce anti-Semitic attack   in   Germany   because   of   his espousal   of   Jewish scholarship   and cabalistic teaching as elements in his   transformational   system   of   know- ledge   and   action.   German   humanists   succeeded in   turning   this   attack against the   perpetrators   by the publication   of   a brilliant satirical work,  Letters   of   the Obscure Men,   and   the wave   of   anti-Semitism subsided. The   forces   of   reaction   and   division   had   nevertheless   made   an   ominous appearance,   and   the witch-hunts against those seeking transforming experiential insight, labelled black magic   or   illicit knowledge,   broke out   repeatedly   in   the   sixteenth   century.   Reuchlin   was   a   reformer, seeking a mystical resolution   of   religious problems. Luther, his con- temporary,   sought   a   political   solution.   The   fragmentation   that followed Luther's   attempts   at   reform in religion was   matched   by   an equivalent fragmentation   of   scientific knowledge which followed   upon the establishment by Mersenne   and   Bacon   of   science from which the astral linkings   of   Giorgi's universal   harmony   were banished,   'cutting off   at   the   roots   the connection   of   the psyche with the cosmos'   2.   Bacon was deeply suspicious   of   the active, imaginative mind,   advocating   the superiority   of   the disciplined   mind   as the surer way   to   scientific   truth, which was   to   be patiently collected as objective knowledge from em- pirical data. That   the radical impersonalism   of   Bacon's   method   applies as well to   Galilei, Descartes,   Newton,   and   Leibnitz, for example, is clear once one recalls the essentially deductive   and   intellectualistic character   of   the   methods   espoused by those four.   Their   focus   on rigorous discursive reasoning as the medium for the articulation of   truth   eventuated   in a universe whose   atomic   constituents were only extrinsically correlated with   one   another,   obeyed generic laws of   interaction   that   made   no   provision for individual

In   startling   contrast   to this world-picture, the world-picture   of   the Renaissance   nature philosophy was   of   a Cosmos composed of intrinsically correlated elements, hierarchically ordered in accordance with anthropomorphic   values,   and   held together by a force called 'love'.   1 There was no intrinsic necessity for science to have the characteristics which it assumed in   the seventeenth century,   resulting in   the   pre- dominantly atomistic   and   mechanical components   that   characterize scientific descriptions,   and   leading to a world-view in which separate identity   is   primary   and   connected relationship   is   secondary. A choice was made, with particular consequences regarding the relations be- tween   part   and   whole, between the intelligible   and   the 'real',   among the individual   and   society   and   the cosmos.   As   Bohm   3   has argued: It   is   proposed   ...   that   the widespread   and   pervasive distinctions between people (race, nation, family, profession, etc., etc.) which are now preventing   mankind   from working together for the common   good,   and   indeed, for survival, have one   of   the key features of their origin in a kind   of   thought   that   treats   things   as inherently divided, disconnected,   and   'broken   up' into yet smaller constituent parts. Each   part   is   considered   to   be essentially independent   and   self-existent. However, he also points   out   that: Science itself   is   demanding a new, non-fragmentary world-view, in the sense   that   the present   approach   of   analysis   of   the world into independently existent   parts   does   not   work very well in   modern physics.   It   is   shown   that   both   in relativity theory   and   quantum theory, notions implying the undivided wholeness   of   the universe would provide a much more orderly way   of   considering the general   nature   of   reality.   3 I shall now consider how the analytical tradition, resulting in a biology dominated   by atomistic (molecular) fragmentation, results in problems whose resolution lies also in concepts based   upon   wholeness   and   re- lational   order   in organisms, similar in certain basic respects to those proposed   by   Bohm   3   fer   physical   reality   in   his   remarkable   book  Wholeness and the Implicate Order.  The   biology   of   Humpty-Dumpty  Humpty-Dumpty   was, before his great fall,   what   biology   is   basically all about:   an   egg,   embodiment   of   the potential for reproduction with transformation, which makes the creative process of evolution poss-

            A   science   o.f   qualities   333  ible. After the fall, which started in the seventeenth century   and   was completed in the nineteenth only the pieces remained to baffle all the King's horses   and   all the King's men.   What   has emerged from twen- tieth century biology is   that   there are   many   more pieces   than   anyone ever dreamed   of,   and   more   are being discovered every day;   rather   like elementary particle physics, one might say, only more so. How are   we to make sense   of   this molecular profusion, to construct   an   intelligible conceptual unity   and   so   to   understand   organisms   and   their evolution? Following the traditional dualism   of   the   mind-nature   split, there   is   a strong tendency in biology to assume   that   organisms have an   ~intel  ligen!' controlling aspect   and   a passive, quasi-inanimate, controlled aspect.   The   controlling   part   embodies the essential principles of the biological state; the capacity to reproduce, to keep the parts working in relation to one another,   to   evolve   and   to adapt.   The   organism   is thus seen as a dualistic mechanism, like a   computer   with its   ~intelligent'  software (programme)   and   its passive hardware which   responds   to instructions   coded   in   the   programme.   And   this   is   precisely   the metaphor   used   in   biology   to explain   the   relationship   between   the DNA   with its hereditary instructions, which are intelligently translated into proteins via the genetic code;   and   the organism which   is   made out   of   these proteins   and   their products. This   computer   metaphor   for organismic structure   and   function has proved extremely useful in the analysis   of   the relationships   between   the different   types   of   macro- molecule (DNA,   RNA   and   protein) which are distinctive to organ- isms,   and   in describing changes   of   molecular state during embryonic development   and   evolution. This   is   the successful face   of   molecular biology, based   upon   ingenious techniques   of   molecular analysis, many of   which exploit basic macromolecular processes distinctive to organ- isms themselves, such as immunological (antigen-antibody) reactions, DNA   replication   (gene   cloning)   and   DNA-RNA   interactions   (hy- bridization). There   is   absolutely   no   doubt   about   the extraordinary analytical power   of   these techniques,   and   the value   of   descriptions arrived   at   in relation   to   understanding the detailed molecular pro- cesses   involved   in   reproduction   and   in   evolution.   However,   what remains very elusive   is   precisely what these techniques   and   the associ- ated conceptual structure are unable to address directly; namely, the nature   of   the integrated spatial   and   temporal   order   that   gives organ- isms   their distinctive attributes,   particularly   their morphology   and their behaviour. Here   we   face a   rather   subtle problem   of   causal analysis which   is more familiar to physicists   than   to biologists. The situation   is   a bit like   that   arising from the following imaginary discourse. Suppose you were to ask somebody to explain why the   earth   travels   around   the sun in   an   elliptical trajectory;   and   you were told   that   it does so this year because last year it followed   an   elliptical trajectory   and   nothing has happened to change the situation.

            334   B.   C.   Goodwin  this   answer   relative   to   the   way   we   have   become   accustomed   to thinking   about   this process,   the   statement   is   none   the   less   correct   as far as it goes, for it says   that   one   of   the   components   determining   the trajectory   of   a   body,   namely   its initial   position   and   velocity   (at   some arbitrary   point   in   the   cycle if   the   motion   is   in   a closed   periodic   orbit), must   remain   unchanged   if   the   periodic   orbit   is   to   remain   unchanged. What   the   statement   ignores   is   the   other   part   of   the   explanation,   the laws   governing   the   process (gravity   and   the   inverse   square   law) which are   required,   together   with   the   initial   conditions,   to   define sufficient, rather   than   simply necessary,   conditions   for   the   process. Biological   explanations   tend   to   ignore   any   reference   to   such laws   of organization   of   biological   systems,   and   so   describe   only   necessary conditions.   For   example,   one   often finds   statements   to   the   effect   that mutant   genes   'cause'   particular   types   of   change   of   form   or   morphology in   organisms.   An   example   is a   homoeotic   mutant   called   antennapaedia in   the   fruit fly,   Drosophila,   in   which   legs   appear   during   the   embryonic development   of   the   fly   where   antennae   would   normally   arise.   How- ever, this   is   cause   in   neither   a specific   nor   a sufficient sense.   It   is   not specific,   because   the   effect   of   the   mutant   gene   can   be   produced   in normal   (non-mutant)   flies   by   a non-specific stimulus,   such   as a   tran- sient   change   in   the   temperature   to   which   the   embryo   is   exposed   at   a particular   time   in   its   development;   and   it   is   not   sufficient, because knowledge   of   the   presence   of   the   mutant   gene is   not   enough   to   explain why   the   morphology   changes   as it does,   just   as a   knowledge   of   last year's   elliptical   orbit   is   insufficient   to   explain   elliptical   planetary motion.   A sufficient   explanation   requires   a   knowledge   also   of   the   way the   mutant   gene   product   acts   upon   the   developmental   process   such that   a   particular   morphological   change   occurs   in a   particular   part   of the   organism,   i.e.   it   requires   a   sufficiently   articulated   theory   of morphogenesis   to   identify   those   changes   in   particular   parameters which result   in   one   morphology   (leg)   rather   than   another   (antenna) in a   particular   region   of   the   organism.   Such   a   theory   must   obviously be a field   theory   of   some   kind,   since we   are   dealing   with functions with space   as   one   of   the   variables.   Once   such a field   theory   of   re- production   and   morphogenesis   is   articulated   (and   there   are   promising developments   in   this   direction   4,5),   the   laws   of   organization   of   de- velopmental   processes will   be   embodied   in   the   field   equations   in   terms of   the   particular   relational   order   in space   and   time   that   characterize developmental   dynamics,   and   the   organized   context   Cthe   organism') within which genes   and   environmental   stimuli   act   as   partial   causes   of particular   developmental   trajectories   will   become   evident.   The   space- time   organization   of   the   morphogenetic   field   will   then   define   some constraint   on   the   set   of   possible   morphogenetic   trajectories   and transformations   which   are   possible,   just   as   Newton's   equations   define the   set   of   trajectories   which   are   possible for   bodies   acted   upon   by gravitational   fields.

            A   science   of   qualities   335  scription in relation to specific morphologies can be found in   Goodwin and   Trainor   6   ,7,8.) None   of   this   is   news: any exact description   of   a space-time process must be in terms   of   particles (usually molecules in biology)   and   fields, and   biological reproduction is   no   exception. However, the particular metaphor   that   biologists have used to describe this   process~   namely that   the reproductive process   is   directed by a programme 'written in the nucleic acid message'   9,   has tended to have two unfortunate conse- quences. First, it implies   that   genes   and   the 'information' they contain constitute specific, sufficient explanations   of   reproduction, in the sense that   a computer programme explains the behaviour of a computer (i.e. knowledge of the programme   is   sufficient to explain the behaviour of the computer), so   that   biologists seek solutions to the problem of reproduction in terms of hierarchies of regulator   or   control genes, and   the 'sub-routines' they control,   i.e.   in managerial, instructional and   information-flow terms. This splits the organism into genotype (instructions)   and   phenotype (the form produced by the instructions). The   second   consequence   is   that   this   metaphor   not   only   divides organisms into a   dominant   controlling   part   (a mind   or   a soul)   and   a subordinate controlled   part   (a body), as did Weismann in 1894   1   Â°,   the originator of this dualism; it also makes it look as if biology   is   in some sense basically different from physics, being primarily a science of information processing   and   transmission   rather   than   one charac- terized by particular types   of   organization of   matter   and   distinctive fields of force. It seems clear   that   the time has come to pass   on   from what was a useful   metaphor   in deciphering the genetic code   and   the processes of DNA   replication, RNA transcription   and   translation of the nucleic acid message into protein, the great   and   enduring achievements   of molecular biology, to a more rigorous   and   exact theory of the re- productive process, without which there can be no satisfactory theory of evolution. The failure of molecular biology, the science of biological particles, to solve the problem of biological form   and   transformation (reproduction   and   taxonomy)   is   not   simply due to a lack of sufficiently detailed   molecular   knowledge;   it   is   a   failure   to   conceptualize   re- production in   appropriate   terms. This requires a unitary treatment of the process in terms   of   the space-time dynamics of morphogenetic fields   and   their ordered transformations. These fields are made   out   of gene   products~   organized spatially in particular ways (cytoskeleton, membranes, extracellular matrix)   and   diffusing over domains defined by permeability barriers, ion fluxes generating electrical currents, cells and cell sheets   and   adhesive, viscous   and   elastic properties,   and   other characteristics   which,   when   taken   together,   define   space-time   be- haviour distinctive to the living state. The study of this state   and   its transformations may be described as either biology   or   physics. It can be divided for convenience in various ways, according to spatial   or

But   the revolution in molecular genetics of the 1970s   and   1980s,   which   has   demonstrated   that   there   is   no   stable molecular   organization   (site   of   the instructions for the genetic pro- gramme) carrying   invariant   packets   of   information   through   the de- velopmental process from fertilization of the egg   to   the   adult   organ- ism,   means   that   the   genotype/phenotype   dualism has   broken   down and   been replaced by the   concept   of   a fluid genome   that   participates dynamically,   and   equally, with the rest   of   the developmental process in the generation   of   the   organism   from the egg. And in   generat   the eggs   of   the next   generation   are   not   separated   out   from the dynamics of   the   developmental   process,   as   Weismann   described   in   his   germ plasm   concept   (although   some species   do   follow this   strategy)~   rather, the   gonads   and   their reproductive cells   are   generated as   part   of   the same developmental process   that   the rest   of   the   organism   undergoes. There are   no   privileged parts; everything undergoes flux,   flow   and transformation,   though   it   is   all organized. And the   continuity   of   the living state from generation   to   generation, via this organized dynamic, results in a view   of   evolution as also a field   of   flow   and   transformation subject   to   both   internal   and   external   perturbation.   This image   is   con- sonant   with   Bohm's   concept   of   ~undivided   wholeness   in   flowing movement', which he   proposes   as the   primary   state from which entities may   be considered   to   arise, like vortices in a stream. This image   of flow,   movement   and   transformation   as the essence   of   the living state, with   various forms   or   morphologies   as   transient   expressions   of   an on-going process, was forcefully described by   Goethe,   who   introduced the term   ~morphology'   in the eighteenth   century   and   gave   an   enor- mous   stimulus   to   the   study   of   living form.   ~What   has been formed   is immediately   transformed   again,   and   if we   would   succeed,   to   some degree,   to   a living view   of   Nature,   we   must   attempt   to   remain   as active   and   as plastic as the example she sets for   US.'ll Thus   we   return   to   the vision   of   the   Renaissance magi, in which subject   and   object, the kno\vn   and   the   unknown,   can   relate   and   par- ticipate in   an   appropriate   unity,   made   possible by the fact   that   reality is   a single   co-ordinated   domain.   As   Bohm   3   has   put   it: There   is   a universal flux   that   cannot   be defined explicitly,   but which   can   be   known   only implicitly, as indicated by the explicitly definable forms   and   shapes, some stable   and   some unstable,   that can   be   abstracted   from the universal flux. In this flow,   mind   and matter   are   not   separate   substances.   Rather   they   are   different aspects   of   one   whole   and   unbroken   movement.  References  S.   L.

            23  Complementarity   and   the union   of   opposites  M. H. F. Wilkins   King's College, London  The   main   tradition   of   thinking in the West has concentrated   attention on   distinct things   of   fixed   nature   which are separable from each other. From   this, basic science has grown. But there has been a less well- recognised   philosophical   tradition   which   has   concentrated   on   the relations between things,   and   how these relations produce changes in things   and   in their relations.   Thus   Heraclitus in ancient Greece and, at   about   the same time, philosophers in   China   saw the essence   of reality   in   change   and   renewal.   Opposition   was   the   relation   which produced   change.   Thus   opposite   principles   such   as   yin   and   yang pervaded   everything,   and   change   came   about   by   opposed   things forming a unity.   As   Pan   Ku   said in the first century   AD   'Things   that oppose each   other   also complement each other.'   In   the West these ideas were   kept   alive by thinkers like Nicholas de   Cusa   (who saw God   as the coincidence   of   opposites),   Giordano   Bruno, the mystic Jacob   Boehme,   and   also the alchemists who saw in chemical reactions the union   of   opposites giving rise to new substances. These ideas were developed   into   a philosophical system by Hegel.   He argued   that   if one   thought   about   opposed   concepts, for   example   being   and   not- being, one was led   to   think   of   their unity in the concept   of   becoming. To   define being one has to refer   to   not-being,   and   vice-versa; logically the two concepts are interdependent, inseparable and, in   many   re- spects, the same. But to say   that   being   and   not-being are the same   is a contradiction.   To   avoid this,   thought   makes a leap   and   resolves the contradiction by thinking   of   the higher-order concept   of   becoming, which contains   and   unites   both   being   and   not-being. This type of argument   -   thesis,   antithesis   and   then   synthesis   --   is   reasonable enough,   but   Hegel went further.   As   an   idealist, he saw ideas as the primary   reality   which   gave   rise   to   all   phenomena.   He   therefore 338

            Complelnentarity and the union   of   opposites   339  extended the idea   of   the unity   of   opposites from the world   of   thought to   all aspects   of   the   natural   world   and   of   human   life, especially history. Thinkers   today   are   more   doubtful   about   this extension, especially to the   natural   world;   and   the fact   that   Hegel was obscure   adds   to the uncertainties.   In   any   case, I shall   make   use   of   a very simplified   1   view of   Hegel. In   his lifetime Hegel's ideas were widely accepted in   Germany,   but afterwards his philosophy was little used, with the   notable   exception that   Marx   and   Engels,   though   materialists, enthusiastically   took   up his ideas which provided them with a dynamic philosophical basis for their revolutionary political ideas. Marxism   is   of   special interest be- cause it   is   the clearest example we have   of   an   attempt   at   practical application   of   Hegel's philosophy   2.   Marx   saw historical change arising primarily from the   opposition   of   social economic classes in society. Thus   it was historically inevitable   that   the   opposition   between the capitalist   and   working classes would ultimately lead   to   the unity   of   a classless society. Lenin emphasised   that   the transition from a state   of inherent   continual   opposition   to   the unity   of   opposites only   took   place under   suitable conditions. Thus,   under   the right conditions, opposition ceased   to   be negative   or   destructive and, instead, gave rise to positive construction. This view gave a   somewhat   different emphasis to   that   of Hegel, who   seemed   to   imply   that   unity   of   opposites was   achieved almost automatically by the   movement   of   thought; he saw   ~in   con- tradiction   the   negativity   which   is   the   inherent   pulsation   of   self- movement   and   vitality'   2 â¢   Lenin   3   emphasised   that   'the   most   essential thing in Marxism [is] the concrete analysis   of   concrete situations'   and stressed the need for Marxists   to   study with great care   and   objectivity the particularities   of   the contradictions   at   each stage in a process   of change.   Thus   Lenin, like Hegel, saw   opposition   in things themselves and   not   merely in abstractions created by the mind. C. G.   lung,   the analytical psychologist, has used somewhat similar ideas   about   the unity   of   opposites in describing processes which take place   during   psychoanalysis; a destructive   opposition   between mental functions may, as a result   of   psychoanalytical work, be replaced by positive healthy complementarity   4.   lung   drew a parallel between these therapeutic processes   and   those which alchemists described as   taking place in their work.   He   regarded the symbols   of   alchemy as   correspond- ing   to   aspects   of   the psyche: for example, in alchemy the incestuous union   of   God   the   Father   and   the Son (the supreme   union   of   oppo- sites)   5   gave rise   to   the dove which represented the Holy Spirit; and, if I understand   lung   correctly (his writings are   at   times obscure), this holy union corresponds to the   complementary   union   of   the intellect   and feeling.   lung   and   the Marxists   both   claimed to be working in a scien- tific   manner   and   both   stressed that, in   order   to achieve a   union   of opposites, it was necessary   to   make   careful objective observation   and detailed analysis   of   the   phenomena   involved.

            340   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  I first became interested in complementarity as a result   of   contact with Jung's ideas. Later, in teaching molecular biology, I   had   to   con- sider the   relation   of symmetry   and   asymmetry   in   macromolecular assemblies. I concluded   that   it was useful   to   regard this relation as   an example   of   complementarity,   and   I began   to   look for   other   examples of   complementarity   and   to   compare   them. Hegel considered all kinds of different 'pairs   of   opposites' as being basically similar, e.g. pairs   of concepts like being   and   not-being, geometrical opposites like left   and right,   the   physical   opposites   of   positive   and   negative   electricity, opposed social classes in society,   or   the highly asymmetric pair   of seed   and   soil which unite   to   give rise   to   a new plant. Is a similar principle of opposition   or   contradiction operating in these very differ- ent situations   and   giving rise   to   particular forms in the   natural   world (for example,   as   the   opposition   of   symmetry   and   asymmetry   in a crystal   can   give rise to forms like dislocations)?   Or   is   one, as some philosophers imply   6,   merely playing with words when one uses terms like contradictions, conflict, antagonism, opposition   and   mutual ex- clusion in very different situations? Even if we   do   accept   that   it   is   valid to apply the idea of the unity of opposites to a very wide variety of situations,   we   may still ask the question:   How   useful   is   it to   do   so? Marxists   and   Jungians are con- vinced   of   the usefulness   of   such ideas,   but   many others   do   not   think that   way. Clearly, the best way   to   find   an   answer to this question   is   to consider practical examples   and   see, in   that   context, to what extent the idea   of   unity of opposites   is   illuminating.   In   the present study I take examples from physics, molecular biology, psychology, music   and visual arts. I also consider the   nature   of   human   creativity   and   have been especially interested   to   see if any new light can be cast   on   the problem of   human   conflict. I have used complementarity to mean the same as unity   of   opposites.   To   complement means to form something complete, whole, perfect, fulfilled   or   consummated. This implies a speci- fic   interaction between the   parts   (two in   our   case) which gives rise to the wholeness   or   perfection,   and   I have   taken   this interaction to be the creative interaction which gives rise to the unity   of   opposites. I have   not,   as   is   often   done,   used   complementarity   in   the   sense   of completing   but   not   interacting~   for example, it   is   often said   that   art and   science are complementary without meaning   that   they interact significantly. What   I have written   is   best regarded as a report   on   work in pro- gress. Possibly it will help   to   stimulate interest in this subject,   or   will readers agree with Jantsch, in his account   7   of   the   important   new ideas about   order   developing   through   fluctuations, where he dismisses unity of opposites as a 'clumsy western   attempt   at   making a rigid structure of   notions move   ...   '? I would be glad   to   have comments. (Since this was written I have found relevant ideas in the very practical study   of negotiations   8.)

            Complementarity   and   the union   of   opposites   341  Niels   Bohr   and   complementarity   in   modern   physics  Niels   Bohr   was   an   outstanding   scientist with a strong philosophical interest which focused   on   problems   of   paradox, ambiguity   and   limits to knowledge. Before he met complementarity in physics,   Bohr   was, for example, interested in the complementary relation between the strictness   of   definition   of   a   word   and   its   practical   usefulness.   The meaning depends   on   context   and   can   be defined more clearly if the context   is   limited; but, in limiting the context, the word loses some   of its usefulness. In classical physics such limits   do   not   exist; for example, the   motion   and   position   of   a body   can   be measured independently   of each   other   and, in theory, without limit   to   the accuracy. But when very small particles   of   matter   such as electrons are studied, it   is   found that   they behave differently from   everyday bodies, such as   billiard balls, which obey classical laws.   It   was found   that   an   electron, de- pending   on   how it was observed, behaved either like a particle or, in another   experiment, like a wave.   It thus appeared   that   an   electron had   two, seemingly contradictory, natures which combined to form a complementary whole. The   nature   of this paradoxical whole can only be comprehended in terms   of   quantum   mechanical theory. Roughly speaking, one could say in Hegelian terms   that   the opposite concepts of   particle   and   wave have united to produce wave mechanics, though, historically, wave mechanics did   not   arise simply from opposing the two concepts. The complementarity implicit in wave mechanics expressed itself in another   way   that   particularly interested Bohr.   In   contrast to the classi- cal case, the measurement   of   the   motion   (or   momentum)   of   an   electron cannot   be made independently   of   measuring its position.   The two measurements are inextricably connected. This   is   a consequence   of the fact   that   observing the electron alters its momentum.   To   try to see the exact position   of   an   electron   we   shine light   on   it. But, in line with quantum   mechanics, light behaves   both   like a train of waves   and   like particles which possess momentum.   When   the light meets the electron, it behaves like a particle   and   the collision alters the   motion   of   the electron.   To   reduce this effect so   that   we   can   determine the   momentum of the electron more exactly,   we   can   use light   of   longer wavelength and   less momentum,   but   the result   is   that   the position   is   then seen less clearly. Depending   on   how   we   make   the measurement,   we   can either measure position accurately   and   motion   inaccurately,   or   posi- tion inaccurately   and   motion   accurately; if we focus   on   one the   other becomes   blurred.   In   fact,   if   we   measure   motion   very   exactly,   the electron appears to extend over all space;   that   is,   it has no position. Thus   momentum   and   position are mutually exclusive. This   mutual exclusion   is   defined by Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, which expresses the fact   that   the total information in terms of   momentum and   position   is   limited.   Bohr   regarded   the mutually exclusive mo-

Because   momentum   and   position   are   mutually   ex- clusive,   we   can   regard them as opposites;   but   we   cannot   recognise in the complementary whole a set   of   relations   other   than   mutual   exclu- SIon. With   our   present thinking we   cannot   distinguish in these phenom- ena   a Hegelian   pair   of   opposites which leads to a unity   of   opposites. I have found   no   evidence   that   Bohr   ever referred   to   Hegel either in writing   or   in conversation. Possibly this is because   Bohr   never dealt explicitly with change arising from opposition,   though   he chose the motto   'opposites are complementary'   and   the taigitu (yin-yang) sign for his   coat   of   arms   9   when he was   awarded   the   Danish   Order   of the Elephant. It   is   also   not   possible   to   distinguish a   pair   of   opposites from a unity of opposites in the relation   of   exactness   of   meaning   of   a word   and   its usefulness.   The   same   applies   to   the   complementary   relation   of compassion   and   justice   10   which-   Bohr   mentioned,   and   the relation   of 'thoughts   and   sentiments' as presented by   Bohr   10.   However, this last example   can   be   put   into Hegelian terms.   Bohr   regarded thoughts   and sentiments simply as mutually exclusive. Looking   at   this in more detail we   see   that   thought   is   by   no   means   autonomous;   it requires senti- ments, emotion   or   feeling   to   motivate it   and   to help decide in what direction it goes.   It   would seem   that   thought   and   sentiments are never completely separable   but   are always to some extent interdependent - even a series of deductive   thoughts   requires some motivation to keep it going,   and   sentiments are   always associated   with   some   kind   of thought.   The   idea   of   mutual   exclusion derives from the fact   that   strong emotions like anger   obstruct   clear thought, leaving only simple re- petitive angry thoughts. And, vice versa, concentrated clear   thought drives   out   all   sentiment   except   cool   quiet   intellectual   enthusiasm. Thus, like the   momentum-position   complementarity, the opposition of   mutual   exclusion does   not   seem capable of being transformed into a unity. However,   lung's   ideas   4   about   thought-feeling relations are different.   According to   lung   the state   of   mutual   exclusion   and   op- position   is   not   the   optimum   state, because thinking   and   feeling are then upsetting each other; for example, a neurotic person might find that   thought   was   disturbed   by   the   upsurging   of   uncontrollable emotions or, alternatively, intense intellectual activity could suppress all feeling   and   concern for others.   lung   sees the   optimum   state of the mind   as   being   a   complementarity   in   which   thinking   and   feeling interact constructively   and   form a unity. With such   an   optimum state of mind one could act with great energy, being   both   fired by strong feeling   and   guided by clear thinking;   or   one might react to a work of art   by fusing incisive intellectual analysis with the strongest emotion. Probably,   human   limits will   always   leave   us   with   some   degree   of mutual   exclusion   of   thought   and   sentiment,   but   we can distinguish

            Complementari(v and the union   of   opposites   343  between   a   state   of   marked   opposItIon   and   a   state   of   partial   co- ordination   and   unity.   By   making   such   a   distinction,   Bohr's   com- plementarity   of   thoughts   and   sentiment acquires a Hegelian form   of unity   of   opposites. Bohr   emphasised   that   the   analysis   of   what   happens   when   an electron   is   observed - the fact   that   the observer (including the means of   observing) interacts with the observed electron - has the   important implication   that   no   clear   demarcation   can   be   made   between observer and   observed   10:   one has to recognise   an   essential unity between them. By   analogy, one could argue   that   this suggests   that   there   is   an   essential unity between self   and   non-self   and   therefore between self-interest   and altruism. There   is   no record   that   Bohr   made   this ethical speculation specifically,   but   I   suggest   that   his deep interest in philosophy which had   holistic tendencies, was connected with his unusually   strong   con- cern   that   scientific knowledge should benefit humanity. Bohr   spent much time   and   energy trying to ensure   that   nuclear energy would   not   become a   threat   to the future   of   humanity   9.   His efforts did   not   succeed and, as a result, he was most concerned   about the   dangers   of   international   tension.   When   Bohr   compared   com- plementarity in different areas, he wrote:   'We   are not dealing with more   or   less vague analogies,   but   with examples of logical relations which, in different contexts, are met with in wider fields.' But   of   human conflict Bohr wrote   10:   'The mutually exclusive character of cultures, resting   on   tradition fostered by historical events,   cannot   be immedi- ately compared to those met with in physics, psychology   and   ethics, where   we   are dealing with intrinsic features   of   the   common   human situation.' He goes   on   to say   that   'contact   between nations has often resulted in the fusion   of   cultures retaining valuable elements   of   the original national traditions',   and   he refers   to   the 'most serious task'   of promoting   mutual   understanding between nations. Evidently   Bohr   did not   see resolution of the opposition between nations as involving inevit- able logical barriers   of   the kind he saw in the examples   of   comple- mentarity he described. L.   Rosenfeld, a close   collaborator   of   Bohr, has presented   11   a   rather different   view   of   Bohr's   philosophy from   that   gained from   Bohr's limited writing   on   the subject. Rosenfeld brings Bohr more into line with Hegel.   For   example, he claims   that   Bohr's interest in comple- mentarity began with his father emphasising the complementarity   of seemingly irreconcilable approaches in biology;   that   is,   those in terms of function   or   purpose   and   in terms   of   physical   and   chemical analysis. Similarly, Rosenfeld attributes the view   to   Bohr   that, when people hold   seemingly   irreconcilable   points   of   view,   the   concept   of com- plementarity can help them to get rid   of   prejudices which could foster intolerance. Rosenfeld also describes a discussion with   Bohr   about   the guidance people sought in religion:   'Bohr   declared with intense ani- mation,   that   he saw the day when complementarity would be   taught

Wilkins  in the schools   and   become   part   of   general education;   and   better   than any   religion,   he   added,   a   sense   of   complementarity   would   afford people the guidance they needed.'   It   would seem   that   Bohr   had   some- thing in mind which he felt was very   important   and   went beyond what he   had   written   about   ambiguity   and   limits to communication. Bohr   is   said to have regarded his philosophy as being   at   one with that   of ancient China. I   cannot   avoid the thought   that   Bohr saw the paradoxical aspect   of   complementarity having   an   importance in the same way as the paradoxes of Zen Buddhism. This relates ethics   and unity of opposites as discussed in my last section.  Complementarity   and   molecular   biology  The   rapidly   developing   new   science   of   molecular   biology   exhibits many   complementary   features.   The   great   challenge   -   to   make   a synthesis of the physical   and   biological sciences - required uniting the seeming opposites of the non-living   and   the living.   For   example, this science   has   revealed   structures   which   combine   the   properties   of crystals, which epitomise static non-living matter, with the properties of micro-organisms which, of all living things, proliferate with the greatest rapidity. Evolution involved the relation of the opposite prop- erties of inheritance   of   defined characteristics   and   the capacity of these characteristics to be modified. How could evolution   and   inheritance be interpreted in terms of physical sciences? The main idea, often considered by biologists, was that   the gene, the unit   of   inheritance,   had   to possess a material basis. But   what   was   the   structure   of this   material   gene?   The   quantum mechanics physicist Erwin Schrodinger answered   12   this question in 1944 when he suggested   that   the gene was   an   "aperiodic crystal   or solid' in which a defined arrangement of atoms encoded the genetic message which passed from one generation to the next. Schrodinger's use of the term "aperiodic crystal' could suggest   that   regularity   and irregularity were combined in one structure,   but   he probably did   not mean that. However, this is what one   does   find in the actual genetic material, the   DNA   double helix. In this structure there   is   a regular arrangement of atoms along the outside of the two helix chains,   but   inside there   is   an   irregular arrange- ment of chemical groups. These groups   join   one chain to the other and   are of four different kinds, each with a different shape   and   size. There   is   a complex sequence of these groups along each chain. This sequence   encodes   the   genetic   message   and   constitutes   the   basic structure of the genes. But how can the   DNA   double helix, which   is   a tightly-packed   structure,   be   very   regular   on   the   outside   when   the inside   is   irregular? This   paradox   was brilliantly resolved by the idea of   Watson   and   Crick of the so-called complementary   13   pairing (the complementarity   being   both   geometrical   and   chemical).   They   dis-

            Complementarity and the union   of   opposites   345  covered   that   the four different groups in   DNA   could be joined together to   form two pairs which   had   the remarkable   property   that   the exterior dimensions   of   the pairs were exactly the same,   and   the positions   of the chemical   bonds   at   the ends   of   the pairs were exactly equivalent. As   a result, if the two chains were joined by the pairs, the   outer   parts of   the   chains   would   be   exactly   regular   and   independent   of   the sequence   of   groups   along   the   inside.   The   exact   geometrical   and chemical relations in the pairs enabled the two   parts   of   DNA   to come together   to   form a well-defined whole. Since different groups are in special   relation   in   this   well-defined   structure   or   whole,   we   may properly describe it as complementary.   In   Hegelian terms   we   could say that   the opposites   of   regularity   and   irregularity have formed a unity, this   unity   involving   a   special,   specific   relation   of   the   opposites. Recently,   other   relations of regularity   and   irregularity have been found in DNA.   For   example, the double helix   is   not   rigid; it can stretch, compress,   bend   and   twist.   It   is   possible   that   this flexibility   of the double helix may   take   special forms   which are related   to   its func- tioning.   It   has also been found   that   the irregular sequence   of   groups inside the double helix produces slight irregularities   on   the outside. These are   not   so great   that   they hinder the processes which depend on   the outside being regular,   but   they seem to provide a guide to protein molecules which need to find particular sequences   of   groups inside the double helix. The   double helix   is   regular   on   the outside probably because ofbiologi- cal requirements,   though   evidence   on   this   is   not   yet clear. If the outside is   regular, the double helix could   fit   into various kinds   of   molecular machinery   and   pass   through   them with mechanical regularity.   Thus DNA   would be like a cine film which has regularly-spaced holes   on its sides (which engage with sprockets)   and   yet carries   on   it a complex sequence   of   pictures. In   molecular biology one   is   studying interacting components which do   not   contain   a very large   number   of   atoms.   As   a result, the variety of different forms   is   somewhat restricted.   It   is   not   surprising, therefore, that   the components interact in much the same way as clockwork which, for simplicity   of   design   and   manufacture, also has a restricted variety   of   forms   and   which, like most machinery, operates in a regular repetitive way.   In   the   DNA   double helix the complementarity appears mechanical;   even   so,   the   unity   of   opposites   in   the   double   helix structure seems   to   illustrate Hegel's thinking. Does the complementarity in the   DNA   structure give rise, as one might expect, to some special new property?   Watson   and   Crick immedi- ately saw   that   the structure provides a mechanism   13   for self-replica- tion   of   genes. If the two chains are separated, each   can   act as a tem- plate   on   which a new double helix, identical with the original, can be constructed.   In   theory, genes might be replicated by a   group   on   one chain pairing with   an   identical,   rather   than   a different,   group   on   the

            346   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  other   chain. But the geometrical   and   chemical possibilities   of   linking like with like are very restricted indeed   compared   with the possibilities of   complementary   linking   of   like   with   unlike.   In   fact,   almost   in- variably, the highly specific binding   of   one kind   of   biological molecule to   another   -   a   phenomenon   fundamental   to   living   processes -   is somewhat   complementary   in   nature.   Such   mechanical   comple- mentarity   is   not   of   great   interest; it   is   almost unavoidable because the molecules must, for energy reasons, fit closely together. Very   precise   replication   of   DNA   is   necessary   in   order   both   to preserve the   structure   of   those genes which function satisfactorily   and to   avoid   damaging   mutations.   On   the   other   hand,   some   capacity for modifying   or   mutating   genes   is   required so   that   living things   can survive by   adapting   to   changing environment,   and   also so   that   evo- lution   of   improved   forms   can   be possible. Originally, it was believed that   a single 'mistake' in forming one   pair   of   groups in   DNA   would be the   main   mechanism   of   mutation;   but   recently it has been found that   most   genetic   changes   are   produced   by   a   much   more   radical change. Breaks   are   produced   in the   DNA   chain   and   whole sections   of chain   containing   large   numbers   of   chemical   groups   are   removed bodily   and   reinserted in a new position in the chain. This   natural process   of   breaking   and   reforming   of   DNA   chains   is   carried   out   by the same chemical means as are used by genetic engineers in their artificial   rearranging   of   genes.   Thus   we have a relationship between opposites:   the   precise   replication   of   genes   and   their   extensive   re- arrangement. Such a relationship is biologically necessary,   and   is   an example   of   complementarity which characterises   life. DNA   acts   as a   store   of   biological information.   With   the aid   of complicated molecular machinery, this information is   'read'   and   used to build   protein   macromolecules which form   the   main   structure   of living things   and   perform the multitude   of   special actions which keep us alive.   Most   proteins are   compact   structures which are highly speci- fic,   both   in their shapes   and   in the   arrangements   of   chemical groups on   their surfaces. In   the case   of   muscle, one kind   of   protein forms filaments which interdigitate with filaments composed   of   another   protein. Bridges form between the two kinds   of   filaments   but   the bridges have mobile ends which   can   travel along the filaments so   that   the filaments slide between each other. This sliding increases the interdigitation   and   thus shortens the length   of   the muscle.   When   many   filaments lie side by side, the most   efficient   arrangement   will be one in which the   optimum   relation between neighbouring filaments   is   repeated   throughout   the structure. It   is   not   surprising, therefore,   that   most   muscles have a highly periodic, almost crystalline, structure.   On   the   other   hand, for   motion   to take place, the bridges   apparently   move asymmetrically.   In   somewhat the same way, the   human   body   is symmetrical from side   to   side,   but   the symmetry is destroyed in walking.

            Complementarity and the union   of   opposites   347  Asymmetry   in   crystals  Let   us   consider the relation between symmetry and asymmetry in the apparently simple case of crystals. The chemical and physical forces between the molecules in a crystal cause the molecules to arrange themselves in a regular periodic way, the symmetry corresponding to the state of minimum energy. Thus a crystal exists in a symmetric form, but can it grow symmetrically? In the best known way that crystals grow, the answer   is   no. A crystal grows by molecules attaching themselves to its surface. But the attachment of a molecule to a flat surface   is   less strong than the attachment to   an   indentation   or   crevice which can partly surround the molecule. Such   an   indentation exists   at the edge of a single layer of molecules which spreads as the molecules deposit   on   the flat   crystal   surface.   Thus   we   can   understand   why crystals grow by deposition of molecules   at   the edge of such layers; but such growth would stop as soon as the layer covered the whole face of the crystal. However, if there   is   a local break in the regular structure of the crystal, distortion in the crystal can be such that the growing edge   of   the layer can gradually rotate, thus building up a continuous spiral succession of layers. Apparently the energy loss produced by the break in symmetry   is   outweighed by the gain in attachment energy at   the edge of the layer. Even when they are not growing, crystals always have   an   asym- metric aspect; though they may be very regular indeed, they can never be perfect. Breaks in symmetry give metals greatly increased strength and   contribute to   many   of their special   properties, and local   im- perfections in insulating crystals give rise to many very important and   special electronic properties,   e.g.   those of semiconductors   and transistors, which are the basis of microelectronics. Where there   is irregularity in a crystal, the symmetry   and   asymmetry do not just 'add together'   or   oppose each other in   an   unorganised way. Energy requirements cause special new structural forms to develop; for in- stance, special types of dislocation   or   disinclination which retain some regularity but also have specifically related breaks in regularity. This is   an example of Hegelian interaction of opposites which give rise to new higher-order forms. Schrodinger knew that the coming together of symmetry   and   asymmetry in a crystal could give rise to special new phenomena. I have wondered whether this was why he suggested that genes were aperiodic crystals, but probably this   is   not so because he also likened the gene to a very large molecule, and he may have used the term crystal merely to express the stability of the structure. How- ever, Schrodinger's use of the term aperiodic crystal stimulated me, as a solid-state physicist, to become interested in studying gene structure; and, of course, I was by no means the only physical scientist who was stimulated by his writing to move into biology.

            348   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  Symmetry   and   breaking   of   symmetry   in   the   self- assembly   of   simple   living   systems  Many   biological structures are, like muscles, built up from assemblies of   sub-units which are identical   protein   molecules   of   one type   or   a small   number   of   types. This   is   economical in   that   a large structure may be built using only the relatively small   amount   of   genetic in- formation required   to   define the   few   types   of   protein. However, the sub-units need   to   be very cleverly designed if they are   to   fit together to   build   a   unique   structure,   unless   that   structure   is   very   simple. Providing the   structure   is   symmetrical,   the   assembly   of   the   whole structure   can   proceed automatically by a process which   is   essentially the same as crystallisation.   As   is   the case with crystals, symmetry aids assembly   and   provides stability. Spherical virus particles are a simple example; they may   contain   only one type   of   protein. This forms   a spherical shell which   surrounds   and   protects the   nucleic acid   (like DNA)   which carries the genetic message which codes for the virus protein.   In   such simple cases the form   of   the whole   is   determined by the properties   of   the parts.   Tubular   shells formed from a helical   array of   identical sub-units are also   common,   tobacco mosaic virus studied by   Klug   and   Butler   14   being   an   interesting   example.   In   this   case, assembly proceeds in   ordered   steps   separated   by a   break   in symmetry. First the   protein   sub-units crystallise   to   form   discs -   circular, flat, symmetrical assemblies   of   thirty-two sub-units. Next the nucleic acid interacts with the discs; it does   not   interact with unassembled protein. The   nucleic acid interaction causes the individual protein molecules in the disc   to   change their shape so   that   the circular flat assembly   is no   longer stable; it breaks, changes its symmetry   and   curls up into a short   segment   of   helix.   Then   other   discs interact with the nucleic acid and   the   resulting   helical   segments   join   together   to   build   up   the completely   helical   assembly.   The   length   of   the   whole   assembly   is lill).ited by the length   of   the nucleic acid molecule which fits inside it. An   advantage   of   this   rather   complex   mode   of   assembly   is   that   the nucleic acid does   not   have to be   added   separately to the assembly and   the   protein shell   cannot   be assembled completely without   the nucleic   acid   being   in   it.   Also,   assembly   should   be   faster   if   pre- assembled   protein   discs are used instead   of   single   protein   molecules. It   is   important   to   note   that   the breaking   of   symmetry   during   assembly is   not   random;   it gives rise to a specific dislocation   at   a   particular stage in assembly. It seems proper, therefore, to describe the relation   of regularity   and   irregularity as a complementarity. We may   note   that the   change   of   symmetry   results   from   the   individual   molecules undergoing a   structural   or   conformational change which, in similar cases,   is   often   an   abrupt   change from one well-defined   conformation to another.

            Complementarity and the union   of   opposites   349  Molecular switching with change   of   symmetry   is   probably also the key to how much more complex bacterial viruses assemble themselves. These viruses, if greatly magnified in the electron microscope, look like little creatures, their various   parts   being called, head, tail, middle piece, collar, etc. Each   main   part   is   composed   of   a fairly small   number of   different proteins,   but   there are   about   forty different kinds of protein in the whole virus. At first all these proteins may float   about   separately in solution. Then, in the first step   of   assembly, one type   of   protein aggregates   to   form one   part   of   the virus, e.g. a disc, tube   or   shell. When   this assembly   is   completed, the constituent protein molecules become able   to   bind   to   a second type   of   protein.   By   analogy with the assembly   of   tobacco mosaic virus, it would   appear   that   the molecules which aggregate undergo a change in structure when the assembly   is completed, this change being switched   on   by the completion   of   the assembly.   The   second protein   cannot   assemble   or   bind to the first protein until the first protein has completed its own assembly process. We   get,   therefore,   an   ordered   sequence   of   assembly   steps.   This sequence   is   self-generating.   In   the same way, the main parts   of   the virus, such as head   and   tail,   cannot   join   together until the assembly of both   head   and   tail   is   complete. Clearly, the constituent proteins are very cleverly designed indeed, so   that   they can switch their structures and   thereby themselves control the assembly process, presumably by changing   or   breaking symmetry. The   way   in   which   these   viruses   assemble   suggests   that,   at   the molecular level, life necessarily involves   both   symmetry   and   breaking of symmetry. This   is   an   expression   of   the fact   that   in   life   there   is   not only order,   but   also change   and   mobility; the breaking   of   symmetry can introduce mobility which may correspond   to   Hegel's "pulsation   of self-movement   and   vitality'. There   is   also a   combination   of   symmetry   and   asymmetry in the static structures   of   many   virus particles   and   other   biological assem- blies of protein molecules.   In   the case   of   a virus protein shell there   is a geometrical limit to the   number   of   protein molecules which   can   be arranged in   an   exactly regular way.   In   order   to   build larger shells,   an irregular small   group   of   molecules (e.g. three molecules)   is   repeated exactly over the surface   of   the shell.   Furthermore,   a greater variety   of forms   is   possible when asymmetry   is   introduced; for example, the head of   a bacterial virus may be longer   than   it   is   broad.   As   well as helping structures to be stable, symmetry   can   provide a basis for amplification of biochemical changes. Enzymes, which are biological catalysts, often consist   of   a   number   of   protein molecules   arranged   symmetrically in a group.   If one   of   these   molecules   receives   a   chemical   signal   which produces a conformational change in the molecule, the enzyme activity of   the molecule can be switched on.   As   a result the   group   of   molecules becomes asymmetric.   The   forces between the molecules then cause the other   molecules in the   group   to   change their conformation so   that

Breaking   of   symmetry   in   music   and   art  The   emergence   of   special qualities from   the interplay   of   symmetry and   the breaking   of   symmetry   is   seen in   many   fields   of   art.   In   music and   dance the powerful, even hypnotic, effect   of   regular   beat   is   related to   bodily   rhythm   -   heart-beat,   breathing   and   walking.   The   breaking of   the regularity, the unexpected   and   surprising element, has a further higher-level   impact   and   introduces a   more   complex level   of   expression, syncopation   of   rhythm   being a simple example. It   is   the same with harmony   and   discord,   and   also with the building   up   of   a theme   and breaking   or   modifying it. The basic rhythm,   harmony   or   theme   is   a reference system which is   an   essential   part   of   the higher structure; and, therefore, the breaking   of   symmetry   must   not   go so far   that   one loses   contact   with the reference system.   In   the same way children enjoy playing games which scare, -but the scare   must   not   go   too   far. It   is important   to   note   that   music will   not   result from mere mixture   or addition   of   regularity   and   irregularity.   The   composer   needs   to   create a meaningful   combination   of   both; in fact, a complementarity. Then, quoting   Arnold Schoenberg, 'Dissonances are only the remote con- sonances.'   15 In   visual   arts   regular periodicity produces very   strong   effects. Regu- lar   flashing lights intoxicate   at   discotheques and, as riot   control   agents, severely disorient. Soldiers marching, e.g. slowly   at   a funeral   or   goose- stepping aggressively, have a   strong   effect   on   those who watch them. The   marching together gives the soldiers a feeling   of   comradeship and, of course,   an   obedient   uncritical mechanical   attitude   of   mind.   The strong effect   of   the   marching   derives from the complementary relation of   the machine-like aspect   of   the   body   and   its opposite, the unique nature   of   an   individual.   Similarly,   the   impact   of   a   chorus   line   of dancers   is   strengthened when one   can   recognise dancers as individuals. The   inhuman/human   complementarity   is   also, presumably, the basis   of fascination with   automata   and   puppets,   and   the   strong   and   strange effect   of   masks   in   theatre   and   ballet.   The   coming   together   of the mechanical   and   non-mechanical evidently gives rise to new qualities.  Human   creativity   as a   complementary   process  Creativity   is   concerned with the bringing into being   of   something new. Since something   new   must   be   essentially   unpredictable   we   cannot hope   to   follow the whole process   of   creation.   If   we could follow each step precisely it would   mean   that   the   product   was   not   new   but   merely a   rearrangement   of   previously existing components. An example of   an elusive step in the process   of   creation, outside logic,   is   the inductive

            Complementarity and the union   of   opposites   351  leap in science. But even   though   creativity has its mysterious side,   we can expect   that   many   aspects   of   creativity may become fairly clear. Many   thinkers, in line with a long tradition, have claimed   that   all innovation derives from complementarity.   For   example,   Jung   wrote 'every creative person   is   a duality   or   a synthesis   of   opposite   or   con- tradictory attitudes'   15,   and   Coleridge   16   saw   that   the power of the poet   'reveals   itself in   the   balance   or   reconciliation   of   opposite   or discordant qualities'. Similarly it has been claimed   1 7   that   the basis   of poetry   is   in paradox,   and   that   metaphor   is based   on   verbal opposition. Recent studies by psychologists   of   creativity often refer   to   dualities   of some   kind   being   involved   in   creativity,   and   sometimes   these   are complementarities,   for   example   the   duality   of   convergent   and divergent thinking. A fair   proportion   of   studies, however,   do   not   refer at   all to complementarity   or   to   related ideas,   although   in view of the obscure   nature   of   creativity we may expect many psychologists to be reluctant   to   speculate   about   it. Psychologists   who   believe   that   creativity   is   based   on   comple- mentarity agree   that   it involves,   on   the one hand, the intellect, which corresponds to activities in the cortex   of   the brain and,   on   the   other hand, mental functions such as intuition, emotion   and   instinct, which correspond to activities in   parts   of   the   brain   which are sometimes regarded as developmentally more primitive   and   animal-like. Henri Bergson believed   that   the mental function which complemented the intellect was intuition, which could provide knowledge by direct im- mediate   perception   independent   of   reasoning.   Intuition,   somewhat instinctive   and   empathic, gave a   broad,   rather   unspecific, overall im- pression   or   feeling which would then be refined   and   articulated by the intellect. This idea   is   supported   by Einstein's impression   that   he was guided by his 'nose' (like   an   animal)   18,   and   that   he became aware   of a solution   to   a scientific problem   at   first   in the form   of   visual   or muscular images   19   which he then   had   to   transform into mathematics. Many   scientists seem, like Einstein,   to   be guided by hunches. But others have found   that, following much careful study, a clear idea suddenly appears in the mind.   It   would seem then   that   two levels   of the mind interact. A   thought   which moves in the unconscious mind passes into the   upper   levels, which   Freud   called the preconscious,   and then into consciousness   20.   There it has   to   be selected   and   recognised by conscious thought.   When   that   has been done, a flash   of   insight   is completed.   Probably   there   is   no   unique pathway for creativIty; it may differ from person   to   person.   Jung   believed that, in the creative fantasy of the artist, intuition was   not   necessarily   dominant   4   and   that   the fantasy could   partake   of   any   of   the four basic mental functions   that he recognised. But, whether it   is   in science   or   art, the creative person must   make   the   most   careful,   thorough   and   intent study of the world, becoming immersed in it empathically   and   yet keeping some objective detachment.

            352   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  One   of   the greatest barriers   to   creativity   is   the existence in the   mind of   firmly   embedded   conventional   patterns   of   thought   from which   one cannot   escape. This inability   to   escape   and   to   explore   other   possi- bilities   may   be   due   to   the very existence   of   the   pattern   not   being recog- nised (does a goldfish recognise the existence of the walls   of   the bowl which confine it?),   or   it   may   be   due   to   inability   to   question the cor- rectness   of   the   pattern   because it   is   seen,   not   as   thought,   but   as reality itself. Psychic regression from cortical activity   may   provide a way   to escape from   domination   by such patterns. Thus, some psychologists see free reversible regression as   important   in the creative process. But such regression   may   alarm   the subject because the intellect   is   no   longer in   control   and   there   may   be a feeling   that,   like a   psychotic,   he   is losing   touch   with reality, whereas in fact he   may   be   moving   closer   to reality.   Thus   the subject   may   retreat   from creativity.   Frank   Barron   21 noted   that   creative writers are "friendly   to   the unconscious'. Schiller   22 wrote   of   a non-creative man: "You are   ashamed   or   afraid   of   the momen- tary   and   passing madness which   is   found in all   creators.~  Thought   patterns   are very   important   because they   can   provide real practical security;   but   they   can   also   produce   illusions   of   psychological security.   As   a   result,   to   think   of   questioning   or   giving   up   patterns may   produce   strong   feelings   of   insecurity   and   fear -   if 1 give   up   my beliefs   what   will remain   of   me? Such fear   may   be a   major   obstacle   to creativity.   Added   to   it   can   be   fear   of   failing~   which   gives   rise   to rationalisations   that   a   creative   approach   would   be   unreasonable.  Brainstorming   is   a technique for overcoming such fears. There   is   also the   fear,   possibly   unconscious,   of   adopting   an   unconventional   ap- proach   which   may   lead   to   our   becoming socially isolated. We are, in effect, exposed   to   the anxieties   of   brainwashing   which   is   applied by ourselves   and   by society.   As   a result, it   is   only   courageous   people who will seek   out   and   accept a great creative challenge;   most   people prefer the safety   of   mediocre conventionality. Einstein   23   said   "1   have little patience with scientists   who   take   a   board   of   wood   and   look for the thinnest   part   and   drill a great   number   of   holes where the drilling   is easy.' Einstein   had   not   only the   audacity   to   seek the thick parts,   but also the ability   to   choose those thick   parts   which were drillable and, moreover, the energy   to   persist   and   find the ways   to   drill them. Arthur   Koestler suggested   24   that   the basis   of   creativity   is   the   Io   per-  ~ceiving   of   a   situation   or   an   idea in   tW(1   self-consisten;   but   habitually incompatible frames   of   reference'. Here again   we   have the complemen- tary   union   of   opposites; the   mind   vibrates, so   to   speak,   on   two wave- lengths.   The   main   obstacle   to   creativity   then   lies in the fact   that   the mind finds it   much   easier   to   operate   at   one   time in   one   frame   rather than   in two. Although conventional   thinking   is   an   obstacle   to   creativity, conven- tion   can   also   playa   role in creativity.   For   example,   Thomas   Kuhn   25 has   made   clear how   commitment   to   convention   aids exchange   of   ideas

            Complementari(v   and   the union   of   opposites   353  between scientists   and   provides a framework in which anomalies   may be recognised   by open-minded scientists.   He   described the comple- mentary   relation   of   commitment   and   open-mindedness as   an   ~essential  tension' which led   to   creativity. Clearly, in this complelnentary union of   commitment   and   uncommitment,   we   are   not   guided by Aristotelian logic (A   cannot   be not-A) which would lead   to   the scientist being in a mere state   of   partial commitment. Such a state would   not   provide creative energy. Instead,   an   apparently   paradoxical logic permits the scientist to combine   strong   commitment   with questioning   and   open- mindedness.   Similarly,   when   a   creative   scientist   explores   an   un- conventional idea, passionate faith in the idea   must   be combined with the energy   and   humility to question it. According   to   the discussion above, the creative state   of   mind has several   main   characteristics. We   must   be   prepared   to accept the limi- tations   of   conscious   thought   and   to   seek guidance in the depths   of the mind. We need   to   look   and   listen with   total   attention, making the fullest use   of   all   our   faculties. We   must   be prepared to persist in the face   of   all kinds   of   discouragement, anxiety   and   fear.   As   a result,   we have the possibility   of   becoming free from   domination   by conventional patterns   of   thought   and   images. Seen in this way, the creative state   is needed,   not   only in special areas like   art   and   science,   but   in all forms of   living. Those who lead a virtuous life will be frequently making creative   acts,   often   small   ones,   which   are   added   to   the   inevitable background   of   mechanical reflex actions which are much   of   living. For   example, in   human   relations we need   to   pay   the closest   attention to the needs   of   others,   and   of   ourself, by observing how a living being is   constantly changing   and   giving signs, however small,   of   some new potentiality.   In   these terms, love   is   a creative   human   relationship. Thinking   more   broadly,   we   may   relate   creativity   to   the   general nature   of   life itself. Life has two opposite aspects, one   of   homeostasis and   regularity   of   routine established patterns, the   other   of   exploration and   successful breaking   of   routines.   Thus   an   amoeba   is   filled   with homeostatic mechanisms,   but   needs to explore   to   find food   and   a   good environment in which   to   live~   and   a   human   being needs the security of   the familiar,   but   also seeks the tonic effect   of   variety   and   change. And,   at   the simplest level   of   life, genes need to copy themselves re- peatedly   and   exactly   but   also, from time   to   time, need   to   mutate.   Thus human   creativity   is   a special, extreme, example   of   the ability   of   life to transcend its repetitive nature. The   creative state,   though   it   is   most   evident   at   special times,   is   in fact present always in some degree in all living.   For   example, a scientist may   become   most   aware   of   the creative process when there   is   a flash of   insight~   but   that   flash has   not   come   out   of   nothing, it has come   out of   a mass   of   experiences   and   thoughts   assembled   and   related by the scientist   during   years   of   work.   During   that   preparative work the scien- tist   has   often   been   in   a   continuous   state   of   creativity,   observing

            354   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  carefully, selecting   and   rejecting facts, choosing   and   rejecting direc- tions   to   follow,   and   all the time keeping   an   open   and   enquiring state of   mind.   As   a result, observations   and   ideas are woven together to form somewhat new relationships. These may dissolve away, but,   at   a critical stage, they   may   reach the   point   where they suddenly click to- gether   to   a much greater degree   than   before.  Mechanical   and   non-mechanical   aspects   of   the   human mind  The   comments   about   music   and   art   relate   to   the way the   human   mind works.   On   the one hand, the   mind   works like a machine,   and   we need that, e.g. when we drive a   car   or,   rather   differently, when   we   engage in simple logical thought. But,   on   the   other   hand, life   is   full   of   situations where a mechanical, robot-like response   is   quite   inappropriate   -   we need   a   non-mechanical, creative   response   which   not   only includes thinking   but   also emotion, feeling, intuition   and   sensation.   The   robot and   non-robot   mental activities   can   be regarded as complementary, each being dependent   on   the other.   lung   saw the activities   of   the mind as consisting   of   the conscious   and   unconscious parts which, in the healthy integrated psyche formed a complementary synthesis; addi- tionally, the mutually exclusive complementary functions   of   thought and   feeling,   and   of   intuition   and   sensation, were fused   together in balanced relationship   and   activity.4 Because the   human   mind has a well-developed mechanical aspect we   have little difficulty in dealing with well-defined situations   of   a kind we have already experienced.   Our   minds have been   programmed by   that   experience   and   we   can   meet   the situation with a   suitable mechanical response. But   what   can   we   do   when we face a situation which   is   difficult   to   define   or   has unprecedented aspects? If the diffi- culty   and   newness   of   the situation are small,   we   may have sufficient energy   and   creative courage   to   face the problem -   we   may, in fact, enjoy the challenge. But if the challenge   is   great, it   is   easy for us to be overwhelmed by it. We may lack the courage to face the fact   that   we do   not   understand   the situation.   The   unknown   can   be frightening   and we   may   not   have the energy   and   ability to think new thoughts.   As   a result,   we   may   regress   psychologically   and   unconsciously   seek comfort   and   security by   adopting   without question some ready-made thought   pattern   such as   that   of   convention   or   authority   (e.g. the belief that   Soviet   disarmament   proposals   cannot   be   trusted).   Such   re- gression   is   negative   and   compulsive   and   differs from the positive free exploratory regression involved in creativity.   The   regression may also prevent us thinking clearly, with the result   that   we   deceive ourselves and   force the situation   into   a well-known category,   although   we   really

            Complementarity   and   the union   of   opposites   355  should see   that   it does   not   fit   (e.g. like the general who always prepares to fight the next war like the last). Thus   our   minds become fixed   and   narrow;   we   are, like Shakespeare's man,   'most   ignorant   of   what he   is   most assured' (or vice versa). If   we are intellectual people   we   may try   too   much to solve problems by logical thought, because we have the feeling   that   logic   is   reliable   and gives security.   Thus   we try to solve complex social economic problems by a technological approach, e.g.   we   may think   that   more efficient crops will solve the problem   of   Third   World   starvation (they do not). And governments may seek to stabilise society by using science-based force,   or   try to resolve   or   contain   international tensions by military technology of mass destruction. And,   of   course, if   we   fail to persuade ourselves   that   conventional attitudes   can   solve the serious problems we   face,   we   may simply retreat into a feeling of helplessness, which   is the state   of   very many people today, e.g. in relation to nuclear war. Alternatively, if   we   do   not   retreat into apathy,   our   fear   and   frustration may be converted into   hatred   and   aggression. This, in the context   of conflict, gives rise to the greatest dangers.  Psychology   of   human   conflict   resolution  Let us consider in what specific ways the principle   of   unity   of   opposites can operate in   human   conflict resolution.   The   psychological factors involved are much the same for all kinds   of   human   conflict. Therefore, although I shall refer   to   conflict between two individuals, I shall also use the East/West confrontation to illustrate principles. The   main   characteristics   of   confrontational conflict are as follows. Each   party   in the conflict   of   course regards his own behaviour as reasonable,   but   the behaviour of each mutually reinforces in the   other the unreasonable   and   psychologically regressive tendencies which, as described above, develop in difficult   and   threatening situations. There is   a lack of ability to observe the   opponent   objectively. Threats   and fears cause each side to exaggerate the faults of the other.   By   projecting one's own faults   on   to   the other, the faults in one's own system seem less important;   and   by condemning others one feels virtuous.   Each party   forms a fixed image of the   other   and   of the certainty of op- position between them. Also, fixed ideas develop   about   what   appear to   be   final   self-evident   principles   of   freedom,   justice,   democracy, socialism, etc.   Thus   illusions   of   certainty instilled by society set limits to   thinking.   Accordingly,   people in   the   US   have   a   simplified   and distorted   picture   of   the   USSR   as   being   opposed   to   freedom   and threatening   the   US,   which   they   see   as   the   bastion   of   democratic liberty.   And,   like   a   mirror   image,   the   USSR   sees   itself   as   the stronghold   of   socialist justice which   is   threatened by   an   unjust aggres- sive US. Dependence   on   a simplified stereotyped image of the   partner in conflict leads to misperceptions   of   his attitudes   and   intentions.

            356   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  With   such   firmly-established   confrontation   we   are   not   likely   to resolve the conflict by merely appealing to reason   and   pointing   out that   both   sides have mariy interests in common. Strong emotions have created unreasonable attitudes which prevent the opponents observing the whole situation with care   and   objectivity   and   analysing it produc- tively.   For   reason   to   prevail   we   need to remove the blocks of unreason. To   do   this   we   need the same frame of mind as   is   needed for creativity.   In fact,   we   have to be creative. So long as the blocks operate, intellectual analysis merely strengthens rigid defensive attitudes. We need to achieve a creative freedom where the mind   can   explore new possibilities   and where   a creative   regression   replaces   the   negative   regression   which locks the mind in confrontation. This creative freedom involves com- plementarities like the unity of opposites of commitment   and   non- commitment which   we   discussed in relation to scientific creativity. The basic difficulty in conflict resolution   is   that   each   opponent   concen- trates   attention   on   his   own   requirements   and   does   not   have   the freedom   of   mind to   put   himself in the other's shoes   and   be objective about   the other's requirements.   How   to transcend such unreasonable self-centredness   is,   of course,   an   age-old problem to which religions have given much attention:   How   can   human   beings free themselves from undue   attachment   to self   and   learn to behave altruistically? The problem   is   often seen as one   of   choosing between attachment to self or   to non-self   or   choosing between being either self-centred   or   helping other people. This   is   a false separation because, as Spinoza emphas- ised,   we   cannot, in the wider sense   and   longer term, separate the inter- ests   of   ourselves from those   of   others. We need to pay attention to the total situation, thus including ourselves in a unity of opposites of self and   non-self. This   is   especially necessary in a conflict situation.   In Christian terms this   is   made clear by Meister   Eckhart   26:   'He   is   a   ... righteous person who loving himself loves all others equally.'   Thus   we should love ourselves as   we   should love others or, in a more limited form,   we   should treat others as   we   would have them treat   us.   This   is in recognition of the fact   that   we   and   our   opponent   have the same basic psychology,   share   the   same joys   and   sorrows   and   the   same fundamental   human   needs.   It   will   not   help therefore to resolve the conflict   if,   instead of being self-centred,   we   direct attention away from our   own needs   and   towards those of   our   opponent. We must pay attention to both,   and   this requires   that   we are practical   and   effective in asserting   and   articulating   our   own interests. In   practice it is difficult to focus   on   both   sets of needs. This   is   partly because the mind finds it easier to follow one train of   thought   than   to follow two,   or   to operate in one mode   rather   than   two (for example, thought   and   emotion tend to be mutually exclusive). But probably the most   important   difficulty arises from the fact   that   when   we   focus on   our   own needs, fears   and   anxieties arise which tend to run   out   of control,   and   we   then see   our   opponent   as providing a threat which

            Complementarity   and   the union   of   opposites   357  reflects   our   fears. Since most   of   our   fears are unconscious it   is   difficult to resist their effects. By   not   recognising the basic similarity between ourselves   and   our   opponent   we   create opposition. In this respect, a unit   of   opposites would be achieved if we quite simply recognised   our essential similarity,   though   in practice   that   can be very difficult. But opposition also arises because   we   and   our   opponent   have differences as well as basic similarity.   For   example,   we   may have opposed econ- omic   interests   or   ideologies.   In   that   case,   much   patient   persistent creative work would be needed to resolve the conflict. In   such work   we   need to hold two points of view in one mind   at the same time. But   that   alone will   not   necessarily lead to creativity; it may instead give rise to destructive mental conflict, indecision   or   mere sitting   on   the fence. An active open-mindedness coupled with intel- ligent discrimination   is   needed to help the opposition of views to pro- duce a creative tension. We may gain some idea   of   the state of mind needed if   we   recognise in conflict resolution a unity of opposites in the way the mind works. For   example, consider the way in which   we   make moral judgments in a conflict. Such judgments can either   add   to conflict   or   help to resolve it. Clearly   we   need, as always, to have a strong moral sense (for the   moment   I shall ignore conflict of moral values);   we   also need to observe closely the behaviour,   not   only   of   our   opponent   but   also of ourselves,   and   we   need to recognise in what ways   that   behaviour   is moral   or   immoral. We   cannot   do   any of this properly if   we   are made unreasonable by   our   emotions   about   our   self-interests. If   we   are un- reasonable in   that   way   we   are likely to make self-righteous moral condemnations which have a finality   about   them which lacks com- passion   and   which discourages improved behaviour in the future. Self- congratulatory   or   self-apologetic   judgments   can   have   similar   in- hibitory effects.   What   we   need   is   a unity   of   opposites of judging   and not   judging. This unity   is   achieved when   we   are able to make suitable discriminations in how   to   judge.   The   capacity to discriminate requires that   we   have a realistic image   of   ourselves   and   not   an   image which   is unrealistically good   or   bad. We   can   also perceive a unity   of   opposites in the way in which   we should provide encouragement   and   opportunity   to   our   opponent   and to ourselves to behave well,   but   should,   on   the   other   hand,   not   impose our   expectations so   that   we   put   unreasonable trust in the ability of either   party   to behave well.   Further, the encouragement to behave well may   not   be only a   matter   of   providing positive encouragement and   opportunities,   but   also of discouraging   and   restricting behaviour. For   example, it   is   desirable   that   we   establish   mutual   understanding   of how certain behaviour will raise the level   of   conflict rather   than   reduce it,   that   understanding being likely to discourage such behaviour.   Thus in conflict resolution   we   may need to   adopt   attitudes which are   both hard   and   soft; while   we   may overflow with generosity in certain re-

            358   M.   H.   F.   Wilkins  spects,   we   should   not   allow ourselves to be swept away indiscrimin- ately by a naive sense of the goodness in all things.   In   line with this, it has been said   that   St Anthony   of   Egypt regarded prudence as the greatest of the virtues. What   I wish to bring   out   in this discussion is the need for   an   essential duality   or   paradoxical quality in the way   our   minds work. We need to develop the capability   to   move freely   out   of one kind   of   mental operation into   another   and   to engage in two (or possibly more) mental processes at   the same time.   In   that   way   we   can   avoid mental blocks   and   achieve a free   and   open state of mind. This desired state   of   mind presumably resembles   that   engendered by studying the paradoxical koans of Zen Buddhism. If   we   can escape from   our   emotional blocks   we   can begin to pay attention to all aspects   of   the conflict situation.   As   Sun   Wu   Tzu said in the fifth century   Be:   'Know   the enemy   and   know yourself.' Such close attention   is   often described as objective, which   is   correct in   that we   should   not   be swayed by prejudice. But   our   discussion   of   creativity showed   that   creative attention involves   empathy   -   we   need to   feel ourselves into the situation.   Thus   our   state of mind may be described as a union   of   the opposites of subjectivity   and   objectivity. We need to observe   and   analyse all aspects   of   the conflict.   For example, in the East/West confrontation there   is   a whole spectrum of factors ranging from material facts, e.g. military, geographical, etc., to psychological   and   spiritual factors which include   our   ideals   and   values and   those   of   our   opponent.   To   examine critically   our   own ideals   and values   is   especially difficult because   we   depend   on   them so much to give meaning to   our   lives.   It   is also important, though   not   so difficult, to recognise what   we   have in   common   with   our   opponent; for ex- ample, in the international case,   both   sides have similar needs for econ- omic   and   cultural co-operation. The possibility   of   resolving conflict depends very much   on   the gen- eral way the opponents think   about   the conflict.   Can   they grasp the possibility   that   there may be a resolution which benefits   both   sides but   which   cannot   yet be conceived?   In   the East/West confrontation the opposing governments   and   the majority of their people see the conflict   continuing,   with   consequent   danger   and   economic   waste (possibly alleviated by   detente   and   arms control),   or   ending either in war   or   economic collapse of the opponent. The idea   that   the conflict might be ended by agreement   or   reconciliation   is   unattractive because it   is   only   thought   of in terms of a degrading   and   impractical com- promise with evil. Such attitudes are the result   of   mechanical thinking. We see the world as being like a giant mechanism   of   parts which interact   but   remain fixed in nature. But if   we   see the components of the world changing their   nature   as they interact,   and   changing their mode   of interaction,   creative   and   unforeseen   possibilities   may   be opened up.   It   is   not   easy to keep   our   minds open to such possibilities

            Complementarity   and   the union   of   opposites   359  of   something new emerging, because   our   minds tend   to   slip   back   into established lines   of   thought   which rule   out   such possibilities.   In   the same way the majority   of   physicists would have ruled   out   the possi- bility   of   a   credible   relativity   theory   before   Einstein   ~ad   actually created it. Scientists create new ideas   not   only by observing   natural phenomena   very closely,   but   also by playing   about   freely with ideas so   that   new ideas   can   grow   and   sort   themselves out.   When   the leaders in the governments   of   the   US   and   USSR   face each   other   with the almost unimaginably destructive   threat   of   nuclear   war   hanging over them, it might seem   too   much   to   ask   of   them   that   they should play about   freely with ideas.   None   the less, this is   what   has to be   done   if the future   of   the world   is   to   be   made   safe. We need   to   escape from the clear,   but   somewhat   limited, thinking which takes place in the cortex and   to let the   mind   regress creatively   into   intuitive   and   imaginative activity. Then, as in all creativity, the results   of   such free play can be examined critically by the intellect. Dialogue encourages a free   movement   of   mind   and   is,   of   course, essential in conflict resolution.   In   dialogue each   mind   learns from the other.   The   thinking   of   both   parties unites   and   helps   to   create, in effect, one   common   mind   which   can   achieve   more   than   two separate minds. Empathy   is   then   replaced by sympathy;   opponents   are transformed into   partners   who   work   together to solve   what   they have come to regard as   common   problems. Let us   not   be deterred if new possibilities   and   new ways   of   thinking seem strange; the new   is   at   first almost always strange   or   even alien. But   I.   A.   Richards   27,   describing complementarity in   metaphor   and poetry, wrote;   'It   can   seem   to   be the   most   peace-bringing liberation ever.' And Heraclitus said   'Out   of   discord comes the fairest   harmony.' This harmony,   which   may   seem strange   at   first,   is   not   a   static   or passive   harmony   but   is   filled   with creative potential   and   life.   Thus creative potential   may   arise from   the   transformation   of   destructive potential. But how are   we   to survive as the destructive potential   of science-based weapons comes   nearer   to   being   enough   to destroy all life   on   earth?   The   Russell-Einstein manifesto said   that   to avoid nuclear doom   humanity   needed a 'new kind   of   thinking'.   In   facing this gigantic and   horrific challenge let us have courage. If   we   have the courage to make   creative dialogue between East   and   West,   we   may   then achieve a 'new kind   of   thinking'.

            24  Category   theory   and   family resemblances  Alan   Ford   University   of   Montreal  The   particular   aim   of   this   paper   is   to   draw   attention   to   the epistem- ological   importance   of   a well-established   but   sadly neglected principle of   semantics which finds its origin in the thinking   of   Ludwig Witt- genstein   1.   The principle, which I will henceforth refer   to   as the   ~family  resemblance principle' because   of   the example chosen by Wittgenstein to   illustrate its existence,   can   be stated as follows. In   order   for two members   of   the Jones family to be typical Jones, it is   not   necessary for them   to   have   anything   at   all in common; in fact they   may   be totally different in every respect; they must   merely each have something in   common   with   another   Jones. The   principle becomes semantic when we   make   the analogy between family resemblances   and   words. It then becomes   ~semantic   principle no.   1': In   order   for a   word   to   be used in a   particular   way there must be a precedent in the family to which it belongs,   i.e.   there must be some word in the same category   that   is already used in this way. Following the pragmatists' tradition, I will refrain from the temp- tation   to   use   the   word   'meaning' when   referring   to   aspects   of semantic   interpretation   and   instead refer only   to   a set   of   inter- pretive strategies   known   as 'uses',   thus   respecting Wittgenstein's advice:   'Don't   look for the meaning, look for the use.' 2   The   word   'category'   is   here being used in the way   that   I hope will be interpretable after reading this article. This principle   is   particularly well illustrated in semantics in the field of   naming, which   is   a fundamental aspect   of   the use   of   language in the expression   of   ideas.   When   one extends the referential field   of   a 361

            362   Alan Ford  word by using it to refer to a newly (first time for the speaker)   named object   B,   one follows a general principle which holds   that   'X may be used as a name for B if B has something in   common   with   A,   a unit which X   is   already used to name.' Let me illustrate the application with the way in which the word 'hold'   is   used in English.   'Hold'   is   used   to   refer   to   a particular sort   of manual   contact   with   an   object:   'Having   the object in the hand.' An extension of the use of the word   'hold'   is   its use   to   refer to bodily   or even mental   contact   in general illustrated by the use in expressions like 'holding   an   opinion   or   an   idea.' A further extension from this use is   to go beyond physical   or   mental   contact   completely   and   to refer only to physical proximity   or   location. This   is   how   we   understand 'holding a dinner', 'holding a party'   or   'holding a meeting.' This   is   the sort   of   reasoning   that   led   Wittgenstein   to   the conclusion   that   the search for meaning was illusory, to the extent   that   the hope of finding a   common   property   for three different uses   of   the same word was   not necessarily a logical possibility. Suppose now   we   apply the family resemblance principle to cate- gorization, for the latter implies necessarily the act   of   naming; you can't, I would think, invent a category cognitively without giving it a name. In   fact according to the emphasis   that   I would like to get across here, categorizing   is   simply a cognitive extension of the process of naming.   It   may   seem to some readers   that   I have got this relationship back   to   front,   but   it   is   a feeling   among   contemporary   semanticists   that the classical idea   that   language   is   a   portmanteau   for meaning 'la vision ferroviaire   du   langage,' as   Fauconnier   2   so aptly names it,   is   an   ob- stacle in semantics, in the same way   that   David   Bohm   3   has suggested that   the   mind-body   distinction has inhibited the growth   of   scientific thought   in general. Once it has a name, then the word   that   designates the category takes   on   life   and   goes   on   naming related concepts.   Inevitably the category   that   sparked its existence continues to be associated with its name,   but   it   is   easy to see how all the objects   to   which the name applies haven't necessarily the   property   which may   at   the origin have given   birth   to   the   category.   Perhaps   I   can   illustrate   this   with   an example from the field   of   syntax, a   good   example being the category referred to as 'adverb.' 'Adverbs,' we are told   at   school, often   not   without   an   etymological reference in support, are words used to modify   or   qualify verbs.   Thus we   achieve the effect   of   communicating something   more   than   the fact that   'John   ate   the   porridge'   when   we   say   'John   ate   the   porridge slowly.' But   'John   ate the porridge twice'   or   'Only   John   ate the por- ridge'   or   'Amazingly   John   ate the porridge'   don't   tell us more   about John's   way   of   eating his breakfast unless   we   are particularly flexible in   our   use   of   'way.' Yet 'amazingly,' 'twice'   and   'only' would all gen-

            Categor.y   theor.:v   andfamily   resemblances   363  erally be classified as adverbs. If   we   try to find a satisfactory definition of   adverb in terms   of   sufficient   or   necessary conditions   that   ~slowly,'  'amazingly,' 'twice'   and   'only' would all meet,   we   run into the family resemblance problem   that   Wittgenstein first alluded to. It   is   quite easy to show   that   all four members   of   the set have, individually,   at   least one property in   common   with   another   member   but   it   is   not   necessarily the same one in each case. It   is   thus perhaps equally conceivable   that they   do   not   in fact have any properties in   common   at   all. The   family   resemblance   principle   is   also   active   when   words   are borrowed   or   transferred from one language to another.   For   example a speaker of English learning   French   may learn   at   one stage   that   an object which in English he would refer to as 'ball'   is   referred to as 'balle' in   that   language. He immediately proceeds   do   refer to all objects called 'ball' in English as 'balle' in French, running into all the diffi- culty one can imagine when he   is   trying to refer   to   'boulette' (meat balls, 'baIlon' (balloons   and   other   inflatable balls), 'couille' (testicle), and   so on. The fundamental aspect   of   the fact   that   categories are in fact de- signated by words   is   that   they are believed   to   be basic to reasoning. At least   argument   structure in formal debates,   and   certainly a lot of informal ones as well,   can   be reduced to the general structure of a syllogism: 1   Token   a   must have   property   A   because it   is   a member   of   category  x.  There are also often   many   conclusions   of   the general form: 2   Token   a   is   not   a member   of   category   X   because it does   not   have property   A.  The latter in particular   is   often rendered more palatable by making the same demonstration for several properties. Principally for this reason there has been a lot   of   linguistic dis- cussion   over   categories   and   this   is   probably   true   of   many   other sciences as well. Curiously, in   contemporary   linguistics the   nature   of   categories   and their properties have   not   been   of   interest   or   concern. They are simply assumed   and   attention,   which   largely   reflects   the   syntactic   pre- occupation   that   has   dominated   the subject since the publication of Chomsky's   Syntactic   Structures   in 1957   4 ,   has been focused   upon   their internal   ordering   and   relationships   in   what   has   been   offered   as   a hypothesis concerning the cognitive level. What   is   to my mind   of   greater interest   is   the status   of   the category as a form   utilized in   thought   or   reasoning   and   the influence   of   its formal properties   upon   the latter.   It   is   of   course difficult to pursue this because   of   the particular status   of   the category in occidental thought, a status which it continues   to   occupy   today   despite the decline   of   the syllogism.   The   work   in   generative   linguistics   in   particular   bears witness to this fact.

            364   Alan   Ford  The whole question is,   do   we reason with the aid   of   categories,   i.e. is   the establishment   of   a cognitive categorial level a prerequisite to abstracting information via reasoning,   or   are they in fact something which in the wake   of   Aristotle we have learned to impose   upon   rea- soning in   order   to   give it some formal weight. I would like to offer some   non-category-based   arguments   in   favour   of   the   latter   hypo- thesis. Pragmatists,   ergotherapists,   writers   of   detective   novels   and   the scripts for   whodunnit   films are all concerned, in   part   at   least, with this question. Experience has   taught   us all   that   doors   won't necessarily open if   we have the key, yet this same 'experience' makes us aware of the fact that   they usually   do   if we do.   How   many   potential suspects are elim- inated by Sherlock Holmes readers because they didn't have access to   a critical key   and   so could   not   have been   on   the scene   of   a par- ticular crime, even   though   they could have got   through   the window like   any   imaginative   burglar?   Â·How   many   potential   scientific   dis- coveries are   not   made   because a prerequisite postulate was unavail- able? There   is   something   about   the 'usually'   or   the 'could' which leads me to think   that   human   reasoning   is   inevitably linguistically condi- tioned   and   that   the use   of   categories   is   indelibly impregnanted with the quality   of   -the name which has all the properties   of   a family re- semblance.

            25  The   implicate   brain  K.   H.   Pribram   Stanford   University  Initiation  At   Christmastime   1975 the issues   of   quantum   physics became relevant to   my   explorations   of   how   the   brain   works. I   had   come   to   an   impasse with regard   to   two aspects   of   brain   function.   One   impasse was the dilemma   of   whether   to   think   about   the events which occurred   at   the junction   between,   and   in   the   fine   branches   of, nerve cells as   wave forms   or   as statistical aggregates. This   dilemma   appeared   to   me   to   be similar   to   that   faced in   quantum   physics where electrons   and   photons - particles -   at   times displayed   the   characteristics   of   waves. The   second   impasse   had   to   do   with   perception.   Evidence   was accumulating   to   show   that   the nerve cells   of   the   part   of   the cerebral cortex   connected   to   the   retina   responded   to   a   transform   of   the retinal image, a   transform   which yielded   what   Fergus   Campbell   and John   Robson   of   Cambridge   University   1   called   'spatial   frequency.' Since the same   transformation   also   occurred   in   the   formation   of   the retinal image by the pupil   and   lens   of   the eye, the   question   arose as to   whether   the   'spatial   frequency'   domain   also   characterized   the physics   of   the visual world which we perceive. I   took   these issues   to   my   oldest son, a physicist   and   superb   teacher, who gave me   an   intensive course in   quantum   physics over the   Christmas holidays.   Toward   the   end   of   his really excellent briefs,   and   having completed some   of   the essential readings such as   Physics   for   Poets   2  and   the like, I   remarked   how   happy   I was   to   be a neuroscientist   and not   a physicist; we have   our   problems   but, by   comparison   to   what seems   to   be the   conceptual   muddle   o(   quantum   physics, we're doing all right. My   son   replied, as   ha   ve   many   other   physicists   (and   also   Karl   Popper   the philosopher   when   I   faced   him   with   the   same   issue)   that   modern 365

            366   K.   H. Pribram  physics   is   not   interested in concepts; the mathematical formulations are   so   precise   and   have   had   so   much   predictive   value   that conceptualization   is   not   only   not   necessary   but   gets   in   the   way. 'However,' he added, 'there are a   few   physicists who   don't   agree to this. They are far   out   types who would appeal to you.' And he gave me   some   names   such   as   Max   Jammer   and   David   Bohm,   and references to the   books   they   had   written.  Synchronicity  Back   at   Stanford,   not   a week   had   elapsed before I was asked whether I   had   heard   of   David   Bohm.   My   reply was professional.   Had   I   not just   'graduated?'   Of   course I   had   heard   of   David   Bohm. Despite my hubris, I was gently advised of two papers which   Bohm   had   written and   which   had   been published in   Foundations o.f Theoretical Ph}'sics  in   1971   and   1973   3   ,4. This was   on   Friday   afternoon.   Saturday   morning   I awoke early and   read the two papers. Bohm, in simple clear language, declared that   indeed   there   were   conceptual   problems   in   both   macro-   and microphysics,   and   that   they were   not   to be swept under the rug.   The problems were exactly those which my son   had   pointed   out   to me. And, further,   Bohm   suggested   that   the   root   of   those problems was the fact   that   conceptualizations in physics   had   for centuries been based on   the use of lenses which objectify (indeed the lenses   of   telescopes and   microscopes are called objectives). Lenses   make   objects, particles. Should one look   through   gratings   rather   than   lenses, one might see a holographic-like   order   which   Bohm   calle~   implicate, enfolded   (im- plicare,   Latin to fold in).   He   pointed   out   that   in a hologram the whole is   enfolded into every   portion   and   therefore   the whole can be   re- constructed from each   and   any part. I was exuberant.   Bohm   held the answers which I   had   been seeking. I   had   for years   5,6   maintained   that   part   of   the puzzle of brain func- tioning, especially the distributed aspects   of   memory storage   and   the transformation into the spatial frequency domain, resembled the pro- cess by which holograms are constructed.   My   hunch   that   perhaps the physical   input   to the senses shared this transform   domain   seemed to be sufficiently realistic to be shared by one   of   the   major   contributors to theoretical physics. That   Saturday   morning   I was performing some surgery   and   my secretary   had   asked   to   be present since she   had   never seen me perform a brain operation.   During   the surgery (which went without difficulty) I explained   not   only   what   I was doing to the assembled team,   but also told them   of   the   good   news contained in   David   Bohm's two theoretical articles. My secretary asked 'Is this the same   David   Bohm who has invited you to a conference   at   Brockwood   Park   to meet with Krishnamurti?'

            The implicate brain   367  I   had   not   registered   that   invitation in my memory,   but   we   looked it up   later   that   morning   and   indeed there was my third encounter with David Bohm   that   week! Obviously   we   were meant to meet. Meet   we   did   and   often over the next decade. I went to   London even before the Brockwood   Park   conference   and   have returned there often to hash   out   specific problems with David Bohm   and   his close associate, Basil Hiley. Always,   both   were gracious   and   patient in the face of my ignorance,   and   explained everything to me in great detail. Only once did Bohm become impatient. I challenged him when he expressed the belief   that   the   universe was all   'thought'   and   reality existed only in what   we   thought. I expressed dismay with such non- sense. Why, if   that   were so, would I need to perform experiments   and why would they so often come up with results   contrary   to what I had been thinking? Bohm answered   that   that   was because my thoughts were probably muddled - to which I unfortunately   had   to agree. But then I noted   that   the experimental results were usually very clear   and not   muddled   at   all,   and   therefore reality seemed   not   to reflect my muddled thoughts. The argument became somewhat heated   and   I decided that, since Bohm   had   not   been feeling   too   well, I   had   better   not   push too   hard   - but   none the less Bohm   had   to go to hospital to have heart bypass surgery a   few   weeks later. Since I did   not   win the argument, I seem not   to bear responsibility for this   turn   of   events. After all, my thoughts could   not   have determined David's difficulties with his heart since I was   not   aware of them. Bohm has recovered fully,   and   neither he   nor Hiley have blamed me for the episode.  The   plenum  Are the events occurring   at   the junctions between,   and   in the fine dendritic branches   of,   nerve cells to   be considered as   waves   or   as statistical aggregates?   What   makes electromagnetic energy manifest as particles under some circumstances   and   as waves   under others? Is Niels Bohr's complementarity formulation   7   the best   we   can do? An answer to   these questions   took   the following   form   and   was reached   in   several   steps.   Bohm   indicated   to   me   that   it   was   in- appropriate to ask these questions in the form   that   I did. The question could   not   be framed in terms   of   either/or; rather, waves   and   particles (statistical events)   mutually   imply each   other.   In   this   formulation, Bohr's complementarity was replaced by implication,   an   entirely differ- ent conception. Bohr   had   invented complementarity to indicate   that at   anyone   moment, with any specific technique, only one aspect of a totality could   be grasped.   Heisenberg   8,   addressing the same issue, proposed   the   uncertainty   principle:   we   can   never   be   completely objective in   our   knowledge because knowing involves the techniques by which   we   make   our   observations.

            368   K.   H. Pribram  has pointed   out   9,   modern   physics   no   longer deals with observables but   with observations. Bohm's alternate conceptualization   of   the wave/particle implication demonstrated   that   indeed   both   aspects   of   the totality could be grasped in one setting. I noted   that   physics   had   made   conceptual sense in the days   of   Clerk Maxwell when the universe was filled   with   an   ether and   particular events   made   waves in   that   medium. The   modern   era   of conceptual confusion seemed to arise with the   abandonment   of   the ether by Einstein in his special theory of relativity,   and   by Michelson and   Morley   lOon   the basis of their failure to demonstrate a distorting drag   on   the presumed ether   produced   by the earth's rotation. So why   not   reinvent the ether?   Perhaps   give it a new name so as not   to confuse the concept with the one now discredited. Dirac   11   and others   had   already made the same proposal.   In   fact, Bohm   had   sug- gested this solution to Einstein in 1953   and   Einstein   had   replied   that such a solution was a cheap shot, meaning   that   it simply replaced one set   of   problems with another.   None   the less, Bohm   and   Hiley pursued the idea   and   proposed   12   the existence of a medium which they called the   'quantum   potential.' Events, particles, perturbed the medium in such a way as   to   account for the wave aspects of   quantum mechanics. Philippidis   et   al.   13   then   demonstrated   in a   computer   simulation how to account simultaneously for   both   the particle   and   the wave aspects   of   the single-   and   double-slit experiments. These experiments had   epitomized the conceptual dilemma   of   quantum   physics as ex- pressed in the infamous Schrodinger's cat (which seemed to be   both alive/dead)   and   the collapse   of   the wave function (which indicated   that when the cat was actually observed, the observer decided   that   the   cat was indeed dead   or   alive). The   mutual   implication   of   particle   and   wave   was   thus demonstrated. True, the   quantum   potential as a medium   had   to have some special properties.   It   certainly could   not   produce drag.   It   had   to be a potential which was manifest   to   observation only when perturbed (by a particular event). But   is   this any worse   than   ignoring infinities in equations when it   is   necessary to   do   so in   order   to make predic- tions? The   concept   of   a   quantum   potential does indeed rationalize   not only   quantum   physics   but   also cosmology.   When   a plenum composed of electromagnetic energy   and   plasma   rather   than   an   empty vacuum characterizes the universe, there   is   no   longer any need for someone with a pea-shooter   on   Andromeda   to   shoot   particles (photons) toward the   earth   so   that   we   might see them. Rather, a   perturbation   of the quantum   potential   occurs   on   Andromeda,   the   perturbation   is transmitted as a wave form   to   us, where it reaches the shores of   our visual receptors. Here the wave breaks   into   particles   and   the breakers are perceived as light.

            The implicate brain   369  Non-local   processes in   the   brain  Non-locality was one   of   the basic issues which   had   stimulated my initial foray into physics.   When   patients suffer damage to their fore- brains they   do   not   lose particular memory traces: they may   not   be able to speak   or   to identify objects visually   or   tactilely; they may even lose the ability to recall a whole mnemonic category   14;   but   individual specific memories seem to be sufficiently distributed so   that   they may be   recalled   despite extensive damage.   The   memory   traces   may,   of course, be located elsewhere in the brain   than   in the   damaged   part, but   then the mechanism by which the traces are recalled must to some extent be distributed   or   else there would be   at   least   an   occasional instance where some single isolated memory loss would be produced. The   invention of holography seemed to hold the key to understand- ing this distributed non-local aspect   of   memory storage   and   retrieval, as well as the constructive aspects   of   perception. If indeed the   input   to the pupil of the eye came in the form   of   wavefronts   of   electromagnetic potentials,   such   potential   orders   had   the   distributed   non-local enfolded characteristics which were also   captured   in the process   of holography.   As   well, certain aspects   of   brain physiology, such as the fact   that   single cells in   auditory   somatosensory   and   visual cortices resonate   to   limited bandwidths   of   the energy spectrum, appeared to share the attributes   of   the holographic process   15   .   These tuning curves reflect the dendritic   non-propagated   slow potentials - the hyper-   and depolarizations - which characterize the dendritic patterns in receptor surface   and   cortex which are constituted in response to the sensory input. On   the basis   of   Bohm's conception, it   is   the wrong question to ask whether these slow potentials (hyperpolarizations   and   depolarizations) occurring in the receptors   and   in the nerve cell structures   of   the brain are to be conceived as statistical events   or   as waves.   Polarizations occur in a medium provided by such cells as the Mueller fibres in the retina   and   the oligodendroglia cells in the brain (cells which envelope the fine branches   of   neurons). This medium can be conceived as a manifold within which the polarizing events are produced. Mutual   implication,   rather   than   either/or, best describes the mic- roneural relationship.   Thus   the mathematical formulations which have been developed for   quantum   field theory should go a long way   toward explaining such   phenomena   as   the saltitory effects which   occur in dendritic   networks   and   are   responsible   for   influencing   nerve   cell output   in   an   apparently non-local fashion.  Space-time   and   the   implicate   order  An equally   important   step in understanding came   at   a meeting   at   the University   of   California   in   Berkeley   in   which   Henry   Stapp   and

            370   K.   H.   Pribran1  Geoffrey Chew   of   the   Department   of   Physics pointed   out   that   most of quantum   physics, including their   bootstrap   formulations   based   on Heisenberg's scattermatrices   16,17,   were described in a domain which is   the Fourier transform   of   the space-time domain. This was   of   great interest to me because Russel   and   Karen   DeValois of the same university   had   shown   that   the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a   Fourier transform of the input   pattern   18.   The   Fourier   theorem states   that   any pattern,   no   matter   how   complex,   can   be   analyzed   into   regular waveform components   of   different frequencies, amplitudes   and   (phase) relations   among   frequencies.   Further   given such components, the origi- nal   pattern   can   be   reconstructed.   This   theorem   was   the   basis   for Gabor's   invention of holgoraphy   19. At a subsequent meeting Bohm agreed   that   in his concept of   an implicate   order   (at least   at   a first level) the enfolding was   of   space   and time,   and   that   at   this level the implicate   and   the explicate (space-time) domains were related by a Fourier transform. Sensory experience   is   in space-time. When   we   say   that   we   wish to make sense of something   we   mean to   put   it into space-time terms - the   terms   of   Euclidean   geometry,   clock   time,   etc.   The   Fourier transform   domain   is   potential to this sensory domain. The waveforms which compose the   order   present in the electromagnetic sea which fills the universe   make   up   an   interpenetrating organization similar to that   which characterizes the waveforms broadly cast by   our   radio   and television stations.   Capturing   a momentary cut across these airwaves would constitute their hologram. The broadcasts are distributed   and at   any location they are enfolded   among   one another. In   order   to make sense   of   this cacophony of sights   and   sounds, one must tune in   on   one   and   tune   out   the others. Radios   and   television sets provide such tuners. Sense organs provide the mechanisms by which   organisms   tune   into   the   cacophony   which   constitutes   the quantum   potential organization   of   the electromagnetic energy which fills the universe.  Coda  This is my understanding, thanks to my son John; to Henry Stapp and   Geoffrey Chew;   and   to Basil Hiley   and   to Eloise Carlton, who often served as creative interpreter for   our   deliberations. But above all, I   am   indebted to you,   David   Bohm, for providing the inspiration to pursue these ruminations   and   to give substance to them.  References  F.   W.   Campbell   and   J.   G.

            26  Three   holonomic   approaches to   the   brain  Gordon G. Globus   University   of   California, Irvine  The relation between technology   and   thought   has been penetratingly discussed   by   Bolter   1.   Technology shapes thought.   Pottery, for   ex- ample, was a 'defining technology' for the Greek philosophers. The potter holds   an   ideal image of the   pot   to be produced -   the   eidos -  and   molds   the   clay   accordingly   to   produce   an   imperfect   ap- proximation   of   the ideal. Plato's doctrine   that   ideal   a priori   forms   are  the true reality, which the manifest things of the world   but   imperfectly realize, reflects this technology. The clock was a defining technology for   pre-twentieth   century   physics.   Thus   Laplace   conceived   of the entire universe as a mechanistic clockwork following completely de- terministic Newtonian laws.   Descartes   thought   of animals   and   La Mettrie included   man   as clock-like. The contemporary 'Turing's man,' as Bolter calls us, takes the computer as defining technology   and   even conceives   man   in   the   image   of the   computer.   Similarly,   the   tech- nological   achievement   of holographic   image   production,   based   on Gabor's   Nobel-Prize-winning   work   in   microscopy   (reprinted   in Stroke   2),   has played the role of defining technology for late-twentieth century holistic thinkers. As   applied to brain science, holography suggests this rough line of thought: 'The brain somehow produces images, constructs the per- ceptual   world.   Maybe   the   brain   produces   these   images   something like   the   holographic   system   produces   images.'   [Direct   realists,   of course,   would   deny   that   the   brain   produces   images   (see,   e.g. Gibson   3,4   and   Neisser   5).   For   them   the   brain   supports   direct perceptions   of   the world without any mediating images.   For   some difficulties   with   this   view,   see   my   discussion   of   methodological 372

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   373  solipsism   6.J   The holographic line   of   thought   is   a highly revolutionary notion   (see, e.g. van Heerden   7,   Pribram   8,   Westlake   9),   since the   ardent mainstream belief was -   and   remains -   that   the brain   is   a wet com- puter, a biological instantiation   of   a universal Turing machine. (In this mainstream belief   we   have the   brain   scientist as 'Turing's man.') I want to carry forward this rough line   of   thought   by considering two alternatives to the holographic model   of   brain   functioning. I think alternatives are worth considering:   perhaps   the defining technology of holography has held   our   imaginations captive -   holography may be but   one technological exemplar   of   holonomic principles -   and   it might prove salutary to consider   other   possibilities,   pursuant   to   the fun- damental idea   that   the brain   qua   image-producing system follows the law   of   the whole. So my strategy   is   broadly 'holonomic'   rather   than narrowly   'holographic.'   This   strategy   roughly   goes:   'The   brain somehow produces images. Maybe it follows holonomic principles in so doing.' I briefly summarize the main theme   of   what follows. In the holo- graphic   version   of image-producing   system   the   system   is   initially empty,   like   a   tabula   rasa,   and   information   is   loaded   in   by   input (through 'experience'). This   is   a 'weak'   holonomy   in   that   the enfolded whole - the 'implicate order' (Bohm   10) -   is   entirely derivative   of   input, not   the primary reality.   In   a second 'strong' version, the holonomic system initially   is   full with existence; there   is   an   a priori   plenum   of enfolded   existentia   that   is   the fundamental reality.   In   the third 'very strong' version, the holonomic system   is   initially full with all possible worlds; there   is   an   a priori   plenum   of   enfolded   possibilia   that   is   the fundamental reality. So for the three versions   of   brain functioning, the  a priori   plenum   is   empty, full with existence,   and   full with possibility, respectively. I especially focus   on   the third version in what follows.  The   originally   empty   plenum  We recall   that   in holography the   apparatus   is   set up initially with  blank photographic film.   Order   is   then loaded into the blank film in a special way, such   that   the whole   order   is   (to use Bohm's terminology) 'enfolded'   or   'implicated' to each   and   every region   of   the film. Then when the developed film (the 'hologram'),   or   even a small piece   of   it, is   illuminated in a certain way -   voila!   -   out   pops the original   order (with loss   of   resolution   and   decrease in window   of   observation as the piece gets small). So each point   of   the film   becomes   full   when the holographic   apparatus   enfolds the whole   order   of   some object to the film,   or   enfolds the   order   of many objects to it,   but   initially the film   is blank.   Thus   in   taking   holography   as   technological   exemplar   of holonomic image-producing systems, the system must be considered initially empty, a kind of holonomic   tabula rasa.   The holographic brain retains traditional roots.

            374   Gordon   G.   Globus  Holographic theories   of   brain   follow holography closely (see especi- ally Pribram, N uwer   and   Baron   11).   The   essential idea   is   that   the brain performs a   Fourier   (or   Fourier-like) transformation   on   input   which enfolds the   input   order   into   the neural equivalent   of   the wave inter- ference   pattern   recorded in the hologram.   In   the case   of   perception the enfolded   order   is   then processed in enfolded form.   Finally, the order   is   unfolded by inverse   Fourier   transformation   into   perceptual information.   For   this   theory   the   perceptual system   is   an   indelible  tabula rasa,   awaiting   order   to   be loaded in along the world line   of experience. I say this holographic version   of   holonomic image   production   by machine   or   brain   is   based   on   'weak'   holonomy   because the implicate order   does   not   have primacy,   but   is   derived   from the explicate   order inputed   to   the system.   As   we shall see,   the   other   two   versions   of holonomic   image-producing   system   give   primacy   to   the   implicate order,   but   for the holographic system the whole   is   not   primary creator of   images   but   is   dependent'   on   input.  The   holoplenum   of   existentia  The existentially full system is best   understood   against the   background of   Bohm's   strong   version   of   holonomy. (Bohm's   Wholeness and the Implicate Order   10   provides a profound   and   wide-ranging development of   the holonomic paradigm.)   He   begins the last   chapter   by stating: Throughout   this   book   the central underlying theme has been the unbroken   wholeness   of   the   totality   of   existence   as   an   undivided flowing movement   without   borders   ...   In   the implicate   order   the totality   of   existence   is   enfolded within each region   of   space (and time). So, whatever part, element,   or   aspect   we   may   abstract   in thought, this still enfolds the whole   and   is   therefore intrinsically related   to   the totality from which it has been abstracted. Thus, wholeness permeates all   that   is   being discussed, from the very outset. (p. 172, emphasis added) Again, with regard to the interference   pattern   of   the light   that   is   pres- ent in each region   of   space: In each such region, the movement   of   the light implicitly contains a vast range   of   distinctions   of   order   and   measure,   appropriate   to a whole illuminated structure. Indeed, in principle, this structure extends over the whole universe   and   over the whole past, with implications for the whole future. (p. 148) Such movement   of   light waves is present everywhere   and   in principle enfolds the entire universe   of   space   (and   time) in each region (as   can   be   demonstrated   in any such region by placing one's eye   or   a telescope there, which will 'unfold' this (content).

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   375  So there   is   a plenum   that   contains   existentia,   the totality   of   what   is. To   emphasize   that   existentia   are in enfolded form, I shall call this plenum the 'holoplenum.' This existentially full holoplenum   that   enfolds the totality   of   exist- ence   is   the primary reality for Bohm. Objects are secondary, derived by unfolding from   the enfolded totality.   More   precisely, there   is   a continuous movement   of   enfolding   and   unfolding. Bohm uses here the image   of   'a   turbulent mass   of   vortices in a stream' (p.   18).   The flowing stream   qua   plenum 'creates, maintains,   and   ultimately dissolves the totality   of   vortex structures.' (p.   19).   Similarly: The things   that   appear   to   our   senses   are   derivative forms   and their true meaning   can   be seen only when we consider the plenum, in which they are generated   and   sustained,   and   into which they must ultimately vanish. (p. 192) So the totality   of   existence   is   primarily enfolded;   and   recurrent, stable and   separable forms   of   existence are secondarily unfolded, like vortices in the stream   of   total existence.   The   totality   of   reciprocal enfoldings and   unfoldings   is   called by   Bohm   the 'holomovement'   or   the 'holo- flux.' It   should be noted   that   it   is   not   the enfolding-unfolding process that   gives rise to the implicate   order   carried in the holomovement. The enfolding-unfolding process has   to   do   with world creation   and nihilation, where the world   is   generated from   and   sustained by the holoplenum   and   ultimately vanishes   into   the holoplenum. The im- plicate   order   in   contrast   arises from   total   existence,   or   better,   the implicate   order   is   total existence. So the fundamental reality   is   the implicate   order   carried by the holomovement,   and   the explicate   order is   derivative of the implicate order.   The   fundamental case   of   real exist- ence   is   total   interpenetration,   complete   convolution,   which   is   the ground   for everyday   existentia,   the   ground   that   generates the   ordinary world. Bohm's (briefly presented) discussion   of   the brain, seen against this background, expands the holographic model. (Bohm does   not   seem especially concerned with the brain theory   quoted   just   below, since it does   not   come   up   in his discussion   of   the 'enfolding-unfolding' uni- verse with Renee Weber   12.   When Weber asks him   about   holographic brain theory   at   the   start   of   the interview he advises her, 'You should really   do   an   interview with   Pribram   for   that'   (p. 44). I think Bohm's conjecture   about   the brain   is   not   crucial to his larger theory.)   The body, Bohm says, 'enfolds   ...   in some sense the entire material uni- verse' (p. 209). Various energies such as light, sound, etc., are continually enfolding information in principle concerning the entire universe of   matter   into each region   of   space.   Through   this process, such

            376   Gordon   G.   Globus  information may of course enter   our   sense organs, go   on   through the nervous system to the brain.   More   deeply, all the   matter   in our   bodies,Jrom the very first,   enfolds the universe in some way. Is this enfolded structure,   both   of   information   and   of   matter   (e.g. in the brain   and   nervous system),   that   which primarily enters consciousness? (p. 197, emphasis added) So there is information coming in   through   the senses as in holographic brain theory,   but   also, in a deeper sense, the entire universe   is   enfolded 'from the very first.' Thus, the brain   is   always already filled with the order of universal existence   prior   to input.   The totality   oj   existentia  are   a priori   implicate to brain matter.  What   distinguishes Bohm's suggestions   about   the brain in the final chapter of   Wholeness   and the   Implicate   Order   10   from   holographic brain theory is the idea   that   the brain might directly unfold the   ex- istentia   of the holoplenum from its own matter. Now, all   matter   in principle enfolds total existence for Bohm; the brain is nothing special in this regard. But for Bohm's conjecture to go through, there has to be a mechanism by which the brain, unlike the stone, can unfold  existentia   from   the   holoplenum   both   brain   and   stone   share. However, this would violate a basic principle of Bohm's holonomy, for the following reasons. The fundamental law of unfolding lies within the holomovement. Out   of   the primordial holomovement, the perceptible world   is   continu- ously unfolded. The holomovement has ontological primacy over the world in virtue of generating the world. ('The things   that   appear to our   sense are derivative forms   and   their true meaning can be seen only when   we   consider the plenum' (p. 192).) It   is   the holomovement itself   that   exclusively determines what   is   to be unfolded. The world   is hoist   on   the holomovement. But then, to give the power of unfolding to the brain would be to   put   the holonomic   'cart   before the horse.' The brain   is   no   more able   to   get   at   the information enfolded within each of its small regions   than   the rock   is   able to get   at   the same enfolded   orders.   Unfolding   is   the   sovereign   province   of the   holo- movement,   and   not   of the holomovement's secondary derivatives, lest the ontological primacy of the holomovement be sundered. Thus Bohm emphasizes   that   'what   is   is   the holomovement.'  It   is   the implicate order that   is   autonomously active   while, as indicated earlier,   the explicate order flows out   oj   a law   oj   the implicate order,   so   that   it   is   secondary, derivative,   and   appropriate only in certain limited contexts. Or, to   put   it   another   way, the relationships constituting the fundamental law are between the enfolded structures   that   interweave   and   inter-penetrate each other, throughout   the whole of space,   rather   than   between the abstracted and   separated forms   that   are manifest to the senses   (and   to   our instruments).

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   377  The fundamental law   of   unfolding   is   of   the holomovement,   not   the abstracted   and   separated brain.   It   is   the holomovement   that   is   un  folder   and   enfolder;   the world   is   unfolded   and   enfolded.   Thus: unfolds Holomovement (   ~   World enfolded   by But then a   worldly brain   that   has the power to   unfold would   be completely anomalous, tearing the fabric   of   the theory. So the brain cannot   get   at   information enfolded to its   matter   any more   than   a stone can, for if so the fundamental law of unfolding would be taken from the holomovement   and   given to its derivatives. Furthermore, the role   of   input to the system now becomes prob- lematic.   On   the one hand, the input's information   is   redundant,   since the brain's   matter   always already enfolds the totality of   existentia.   (Or the holistic totality   is   irrelevant, since input tells existence specifically.) If input's role   is   determinative   rather   than   informative   on   the other hand,   i.e.   if explicate   input   functionally   selects   from   the   totality enfolded to   the brain matter, selects   order   for   unfolding, then   the whole   loses   primacy   with   respect   to   the   power   to   unfold,   and holonomy   is   thereby severely weakened. A problem of 'levels' also arises: the input   order   is   at   the level of the system, whereas the im- plicate order is   'at'   the level of the system's components, yet these vastly disparate levels are supposed to come together in consciousness. So Bohm's conjecture regarding brain functioning does   not   seem to be viable.  The   holoplenum   of   possibilia  We   recall   that   in   the   first   version   of holonomic   image-producing system the enfolded   order   was originally dependent on, derivative   of, input.   Holonomy   here   is   'weak,' in   that   the   whole does   not   have primacy. The explicate   order   of   input   is   more fundamental   than   the implicate order, which does   not   exist in the absence of explicate input. In   the   second   version,   the   enfolded   order   was   a priori   implicate. Here   the   enfolded   whole   does   have   primacy,   but   a   number   of problems   arise,   as   just   discussed.   For   the   third   version (Globus   13,6,14)   the enfolded whole   is   neither primary   nor   secondary to explicate input,   but   is ordinarily of complementary status to it. This third version   of   holonomic image-producing system will next be elaborated. Enfolding   and   unfolding here become cooperative processes. The enfolding process   that   creates the holoplenum   is   non-specific; there are randomly-generated 'waves'   of   all frequencies, phases   and   amp- litudes which are superposed. There results   an   interference pattern of infinite richness, all possibilities of explicate order being enfolded to it

            378   Gordon   G.   Globus  by   random   mechanisms.   So   the   non-specific   process   generates   a 'holoplenum   of   possibilia.'   The   unfolding process,   on   the   other   hand, specifically selects a possibility for actual explicate existence.   Brain action thus includes a continuous indiscriminate generative process and   simultaneously   a   discriminate   selection   process.   The   selection process   unfolds   particular   orders   to   explicate   existence   and   the generative process provides all possibilities of enfoldment. The   enfolding process   can   be   thought   of   as in a certain sense 'pas- sive'   and   the unfolding process as 'active.' By 'passive' I   mean   that   the process has   no   discrimination,   no   order, only blind   random   activity that   generates the holoplenum   of   possibilia.   The   'active' process in contrast   discriminates, selects specifically. Ordinarily these processes are   cooperative,   but   extraordinarily,   as   in   meditation,   the   active selection   process ceases   operation,   the   unfolded   world   accordingly collapses,   and   there remains the 'passive'   non-dual   void, a holoplenum of   possibilia.  Now   I have argued above   that   the   brain   cannot   unfold the   exist- entia   enfolded   to   its   matter   any   more   than   a rock can,   and   by parity of   argument   the same would hold true for   possibilia.   What   we   are to conceive instead   is   that   the   brain   in its unsurpassed complexity gen- erates its own holoplenum   of   possibilia   -   a virtual holoworld   of   pos- sible worlds.   The   holoplenum   of   possibilia   is   thus a system property. The   brain   matter   might enfold a plenum, like all matter, as   Bohm says,   but   also,   and   uniquely, the   brain   system upholds, constitutes, generates its   own   plenum. To   unpack   this   idea,   consider   the   immensely   rich,   continually fluctuating, electrochemical field in a small brain region.   The   natural mathematical   description   of   this field   of   fluctuating   points   utilizes complex numbers, treating the field as if a   number   of   waves   of   different frequency, phase   and   amplitude are interfering. This electrochemical field would be a function   of   spontaneously generated neural activity coursing   through   densely   interconnected   neural   networks,   whose wiring logic   is   such as   to   create   an   electrochemical interference   pattern of such richness   that   all possible world orders would be enfolded to it. Whatever the brain's   matter   enfolds (whether   existentia,   or   even   possi- bilia)   at   its highest level the   brain   generates its own plenum governed by the law   of   the whole,   a   virtual holoworld   of   enfolded   possible worlds. At the same time   that   the   brain   continuously generates a holoworld, there   is   a holonomic mechanism for unfolding particular worlds from the holoworld. The concept here   is   that   the   brain   generates neural filters   on   input   that   are mathematically complex   and   continuously tunes these filters;   that   is, the battery   of   complex filters   on   input   is tuned,   moment   to   moment,   to   pick   up   this   or   that.   Thus   the tuned filter   on   input   physically   realizes   certain   abstract   specifications   or concepts,   sets   up   abstract   'conditions   of   satisfaction.'   (On   inten-

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   379  tionality   and   conditions   of   satisfaction, see Searle   15.)   On   passing the suitably transformed input   through   such a complex filter,   an inst- antaneous   cross-correlation   is   performed.   (Holonomic   systems   are especially adept   at   instantaneously computing cross-correlation, auto- correlation   and   convolution (see Stroke   2).)   When the abstract con- ditions   of   the filter are matched by abstract properties of the input flux -   when 'reality' satisfies the filter conditions as indicated by the high correlation -   those abstract conditions   attain   a special status, and   specify unfoldings   of   particular worlds from the autonomously generated   holoworld.   So   enfolding   and   unfolding   are   cooperative,  simultaneously generative   of   all   possibilia   and selective   of   particular  existentia. The reciprocity in the holographic system, rather   than   cooperation, is   striking; there   is   a   Fourier   transformation   that   enfolds   order   to the hologram,   and   inverse   Fourier   transformation   unfolds   that   same order. Again, in Bohm's several illustrations of ink drops in turning glycerin   10,   the glycerin is turned   and   the ink   drop   is   distributed to the whole medium;   on   reverse turning, the ink   drop   is   unfolded   out   of the   medium.   In   Bohm's   stream   illustration,   vortices   are   created (unfolded) from the stream   and   dissolved (enfolded) into the stream. In   all these illustrations, the dominating image   is   that   of back-and- forth-within-a-primary-whole. But these images   do   not   fit the third version of holonomic image-producing system;   that   which   is   unfolded for this version   is   not   again enfolded. Instead all possibilities are continu- ously enfolded   and   one actuality   is   continuously unfolded. The 'pas- sive' principle governs enfoldment   and   the 'active' principle governs unfoldment. The brain indiscriminately generates a holoworld of all possible worlds and, based   on   the match between the abstract speci- fications of its continuously-tuned holofilters   on   input   and   the abstract properties of the   input   flux, worlds are discriminately unfolded from the holoworld. The difference in conception between the holoplenums of   existentia  and   possibilia   is   reflected also in the theory of mind (as applied to perception, in   the   present   discussion).   For   Bohm,   both   mind   and matter   are unfolded from a   'common   higher-dimensional ground' (p. 209).   This   is   Spinozan in   spirit,   the   common   ground   providing   a neutral monism ('a nature beyond both') from which   both   mental   and material aspects are unfolded. The more comprehensive, deeper,   and   more inward actuality   is neither mind   nor   body   but   rather a yet higher-dimensional actuality, which   is   their   common   ground   and   which   is   of   a nature beyond both.   Each of these is then only a relatively independent sub-totality   and   it   is   implied   that   this relative independence derives from the higher-dimensional   ground   in which mind   and body are ultimately one (rather as   we   find   that   the relative

            380   Gordon   G.   Globus  independence   of   the manifest   order   derives from the   ground   of   the implicate order). (p. 209, emphasis added) For   the   holoplenum   of   possibilia   version, in contrast,   mind   is   not unfolded like matter,   but   mind   is   the very action   of   unfolding.   In   the case   of   perception, mind   is   a   process   of   selecting worlds from   the holoworld constituted by   autonomous   processes.   (Or   we   might say in phenomenological terms   that   'intentional action'   is   selective unfold- ing.) To   summarize   the   third   version   of   holonomic   image-producing system, there are complementary neural processes   at   work under ordin- ary conditions.   The   randomly functioning 'passive' process continu- ously generates a neural holoplenum   of   possibilia,   a holoworld of pos- sible worlds, a plenum filled indiscriminately.   The   discriminative pro- cess continuously selects the perceived world by unfolding from the holoworld.   The   two processes thus complement each   other   in generating the world.   The   world's status   is   accordingly derivative   and   is   illusory (as in a kind   of   holonomic rendition   of   the doctrine   of   maya).   Under extraordinary conditions, in great contrast, the discriminate process ceases,   and   there remains the indiscriminate process   that   generates the   holoplenum   of   possibilia,   a   dynamic   distinction   less   void   that enfolds all   possibilia.  Discussion  We have seen   that   the strong   holonomy   of   Bohm's conjecture re- garding the   brain   runs   into   difficulty.   The   alternatives are either re- version to the weak   holonomy   that   looks to holography as defining technology   or   modification   to   a   very   strong   holonomy   with   its holoplenum   of   possibilia.   The alternative weak   and   very strong ver- sions are next considered with respect to   the empirical findings   of brain   science. Since available   data   is   not   rich enough to discriminate them, my discussion   of   this   point   is   limited to the general prospect for holonomic   brain   functioning. There   is   excellent evidence   that   the   brain   Fourier   transforms input, which means   that   the brain has the capacity to deal with wave forms and   follows, as Pietsch   16   says, a 'wavy logic,'   or   what Yevick   17   calls a   'Fourier   logic.'   (For   a review of this evidence, see   Kent   18   (4.1   and 5.VI)   and   DeValois   and   DeValois   19.)   The   evidence suggests that: The   brain employs   Fourier   analysis in the   domain   of   spatial frequencies in its analysis   of   visual input. Thus, visual exposure to a square wave grating fatigues the brain's ability to respond to odd   harmonics   of   the square wave grating, even when these are subsequently presented individually in the form   of   pure spatial sine wave gratings. Even harmonics are   not   affected. The only easy explanation   of   this   is   that   the   brain   processes the spatial

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   381  frequency   components   of   the spatial   square   waves by some Fourier-like process which separates them into independent frequency channels.   (Kent   18,   p.   114) So the   brain   perceptual system is doing the right kind   of   thing if the brain   is   to   be considered a holonomic system   at   a fundamental level. It   should be   noted   in this regard   that   the   brain   might   compute   a Fourier   transform in the cumbersome serial fashion   that   the   computer does. (Cf. the Blackman   and   Tukey   20   algorithm for calculating the fast   Fourier   transform.)   But it   is   also conceivable   11.18   that   an   in- stantaneous   Fourier   transform might be gracefully accomplished, as in   optical   information-processing   systems   21   .   The   available   data   is not   rich   enough   to resolve this issue. When   we   turn   from   the lower-level processing in   the perceptual system   to   higher   brain   functions, such as conscious perception, there is   even less data. Higher   brain   functions remain a vast   terra incognita  for   brain   science.   The   mainstream   has confidently   assumed   that   the brain   is   a 'wet' computer, a   biological instantiation   of   a   universal Turing   machine,   and   mainly ignored the alternative holonomic version put   forward by   Pribram   8   and   others. There has been little felt sense of   'crisis'   about   the   brain   model   that   takes   the   computer   as   tech- nological exemplar,   and   accordingly little   motivation   to embrace scien- tific   revolution.   As   already mentioned, the   computer   is   a   'defining technology'l   for the   contemporary   'Turing's man.' Turing's   man   just shrugs off the brilliant existential, essentially Heideggerian, critique   of artificial intelligence by Dreyfus   22,   who argues in effect   that   computers can't   do   what   Dasein   does. To   summarize the empirical situation, in so far as we know, the data   available   is   consistent with the brain's functioning significantly at   lower levels according   to   holonomic principles   (Fourier   logic), in addition   to   or   rather   than   functioning according   to   analytic principles (Boolean logic). The   data   is   not   yet in with regard   to   higher levels of brain   functioning.   Holonomic   speculations   accordingly   remain   of heuristic value. It   must   be   admitted   that   holonomic theories   of   brain   functioning 'sound   implausible,'   and   especially so for the   a priori   holoplenum   of  possibilia,   but   this might be said   of   any   revolutionary   paradigm   in relation   to   the   consensus   paradigm.   There   is,   however,   biological precedent for   a priori   theories. As   Jerne   23   has discussed,   an   analogy   can   be   drawn   between the central nervous system   and   the   immune   system. (See also   Conrad   24, Young   25   and   Edelman   26.)   The   immune   system is faced with the task   of matching   antibody   to   an   infinite variety   of   antigen, including antigen produced   technologically. It was once   thought   that   antigen somehow instructed   the   immune   system   to   produce   matching   antibody,   but it is now   known   that   there   is   an   a priori   set   of   antibody,   and   antigen

            382   Gordon   G.   Globus selects   the best matching antibody for amplified production. There   is a many-to-one mapping   of   antigen   on   to antibody such   that   a priori  antibody   covers   the   entire   a posteriori   antigen   domain.   Thus   the immune system, implausibly to traditional belief, continuously gen- erates what I have called   an   a priori   plenum   of   possibilia.   Jerne   23 argues   that   there   is   a basic principle of biological nature   at   work here which   is   relevant   to   brain functioning. The   a priori   holoplenum of  possibilia   embodies this principle. There   is   another   line   of   evidence   that   bears   on   the alternative ver- sions of holonomic image-producing systems. (See Globus   13   for a more extensive discussion of this evidence.)   It appears   that   under special circumstances ('altered states   of   consciousness') human beings have the creative capacity to constitute   de   novo   perfectly authentic worlds in the absence   of   input, worlds which have never previously been experienced. If this   is   so, then the weak version cannotiaccount for it, since the world for this version   is   derived from input. The very strong version, in which all worlds are   a priori   implicate,   is   consistent with this creative capacity, however; in altered states of consciousness novel worlds (Castaneda's   27   'separate realities') might be unfolded from the holoworld. The 'special circumstances' in 'which this creative capacity becomes manifested include   both   ordinary dreaming   and   extraordinary sorceric practices.   In   the latter   28,29,   the sorceric adept has the waking ability to hurl himself   or   herself (or the disciple   is   hurled by the master sorcerer's power) into the   nagual,   where strange yet fully authentic worlds are constituted.   For   example, a well-timed shove by   'Don   Juan'   pushes 'Carlitos' from the   tonal   into the   nagual,   and   Carlitos immediately finds himself removed from   an   airline office to a marketplace miles away where there are some bizarre goings   on   29.   In ordinary dreaming, the same kind   of   authentic novelty occurs. We dream worlds   we   have never before seen,   and   the 'lucid dreamer' can   do   so   at   will. It   is   of   course true, per   Freud   30,   that   the dream world somehow resembles past worlds, indeed specific past worlds pointed to by the dreamer's free   associations.   This led   Freud   to   consider the   dream world to be   se~ond-hand,   a composition of memory traces of past experience. Since the second-hand dream world   is   dependent on past input, this would be consistent with the holographic model. I have argued elsewhere   31   however,   that   the resemblance between the dream world and past waking worlds   is   entirely abstract,   and   not   based on concrete memory traces. Concepts operative during various waking experiences   become   simultaneously   re-operative   during   dreaming, where the concepts generate their own fulfillments. Another kind   of   'evidence' relevant to the alternative versions of holonomic image-producing system comes from the mystical tradition (the 'perennial philosophy').   (For   a wider discussion   of   holonomy and mysticism, see the Weber interview of Bohm   on   the physicist   and   the

            Three holonomic approaches to the brain   383  mystic   12   and   also   my   defense   of   Bohm   against Wilber   33   .)   It   is   clear that   in the perennial philosophy the   non-dual   whole (the   Godhead,  Brahman)   has ontological primacy over   existentia.   The   Godhead   is   an infinitely full   plenum, the original source   of   all explicate existence. This   is   inconsistent with the   holographic   version, where the plenum   is originally empty,   but   consistent with the idea   of   the   a priori   holo- plenurn   of   possibilia.  To   illustrate further, consider the succinct   paradox   formulated by Sri   Ramana   Maharshi   (discussed by Wilber   31   (p. 250)): The   world   is   illusory. Only   Brahman   is   real. Brahman   is   the world. Interpreted   holographically, the 'illusory' world is the world unfolded by the brain, a world   that   models the true reality (Brahman). But the claim   that   joins the   paradox   (,Brahman   is   the world')   must   remain paradoxical   on   the holographic interpretation, since a model   is   not the same as   that   modeled. Interpreted   according   to   very   strong   holonomy, the world   is   'il- lusory' in the sense   that   the   primary   reality   (Brahman)   is a holoworld from   which   the   world   is   secondarily   derived   by   unfolding.   That 'Brahman   is   the world'   is   interpreted   to   mean   that   Brahman   enfolds all possible worlds.   Thus   the   paradox   is resolved: the   true   reality   of brain   is   an   a priori   holoworld enfolding all possible worlds   and   from which   particular   'illusory' worlds   are   unfolded.   When   unfolding action -   which   is   tantamount   to   'intentional action' -   ceases, there remains the void   of   the   holoplenum   that   enfolds all possibilities. The resolution of   the mystical   paradox   in terms   of   very   strong   holonomy,   and   that paradox's   persistence in terms   of   weak holonomy,   supports   the very strong   version   of   holonomic   image-producing system.  Summary  Three versions   of   holonomic   brain   theory have been discussed.   The first   version   11   takes   holography   as   defining   technology.   Here   the holoplenum   is originally empty,   and   loaded   by explicate input,   and accordingly   holonomy   is   'weak.'   The   second version, based   on   a con- jecture by   Bohm   10,   has the   holoplenum   originally full with   existentia.  This version's   strong   holonomy   is   flawed,   since the explicate   brain system   is   anomalous,   having the power to unfold   what   otherwise be- longs   to   the   holomovement.   The   third   version   13,14,32   finds   the holoplenum originally full with   possibilia.   This version   is   supported by consideration   of   altered states   of   consciousness   and   the perennial philosophy.

            27  Wholeness   and   dreaming  Montague Ullman,   M.D.  It   is a   decade   since   my   first   encounter   with   David   Bohm   and   his way of   thinking   about   reality.   My   concern   then,   as   now, is with the   nature of   our   dreaming   experience. His views set   up   a   certain   resonance   that subtly,   but   insistently, helped   me   move   to   a new way   of   looking   at dreams. I say new because it   departs   radically from the views I held as   someone   brought   up   in   the   psychoanalytic   tradition.   To   mention one   such   radical   departure,   to   which   I will   come   back   later,   I   no longer   look   upon   dreaming   primarily   as   an   individual   matter.   Rather, I see it as   an   adaptation   concerned   with   the   survival   of   the   species and   only   secondarily with   the   individual. I refer   to   this as   the   species- connectedness aspect   of   dreaming.   In   this   presentation   I will try   to relate   two   aspects   of   Bohm's   thought   to   dreaming; namely,   the   notion of   unbroken   wholeness   and   his   concept   of   the   implicate order. Bohm   postulates   an   underlying   order,   not   directly knowable,   but constituting   the   ground   of   all being,   the   implicate   order   1.   Out   of   this a manifest   order   arises.   Through   the way we perceive this manifest order   we   ourselves   create   a   perceptual   order,   otherwise   known   as consensus reality   or   middle-order   reality   2.   As a result   of   long   condi- tioning   our   perceptual   order   takes   discreteness as the   primary   given, despite   our   ever-deepening   understanding   of   field interrelationships. Bohm   suggests,   and   I   think   rightly so,   that   this   approach   to   understand- ing the   nature   of   reality   has   played   an   important   role in fostering the degree   of   alienation   and   fragmentation   that   now   exists   among   the members   of   the   human   species. Bohm's   contributions   offer   some   leverage   to   set   in   motion   a counter-force.   What   if we were   to   turn   things upside   down   and   em- phasize   connection   and   wholeness   instead   of   discreteness?   And   if each 386

            Wholeness and dreaming   387  of   us   were   to   re-examine   the   givens   in   our   individual   disciplines? Might   the   perceptual   order   we   arrive   at   then   move closer   to   the manifest   order   and, in so doing, become   more   attuned   to the implicate order?   In   what   follows   I will try   to   illustrate   what   I mean by re- formulating a way   of   looking   at   our   dreaming existence. There are two ways   of   knowing the world   and   our   relationship to it. They are quite different   and   serve different needs   of   the organism. The first   is   the way   of   scientific knowledge, with its down-to-earth counterpart,   common   sense. This   is   knowledge   of   the world as object. Its function   is   to   separate, compartmentalize, fragment, analyze the world into bits   and   pieces small   enough   for us   to   handle   and   use for our   own ends. This   mode   of   knowledge has resulted in mastery   but not   wisdom.   It   is   incomplete   and   therefore false. Despite the heroic proportions   to which it has evolved it   can   no longer   stand   alone as the measure of man's potential. Whatever dreaming is,   and   we are far from understanding its true nature, it   is   a   regular feature   of   the sleep phase   of   our   existence. Properly appreciated,   our   dream   life   can   be seen as   an   example of a second   mode   of   knowledge   that   stands,   not   in opposition to,   but   in a complementary relationship to   what   we ordinarily regard as know- ledge. I   am   referring to the aesthetic-creative   approach   to   knowledge which   is   probably older   than   our   strivings for mastery.   It   seeks to create   and   maintain   meaningful   contact   between men.   It   helps   man   to transcend himself   and   experience himself as   part   of   a larger whole.   In the formulations   of   Andras Angyal   3   it serves man's   homonomous   need, the need to connect with a larger   supporting   environment,   just   as the mastery over objects serves his   autonomous   need, the need to   maintain one's own boundaries.   In   its manifestations it   is   immediate, sensuous, ineffable   and   infinite.   It   is   the wave   counterpart   to the particulate notions   of   science.   It   serves   man's   need for unity, togetherness   and harmony.   When   scientific knowledge   is   developed in a one-sided way it results in the separation of subject   and   object   and   becomes divisive in character.   When   the creative-aesthetic way   of   knowing   is   misapplied it results   at   best in the cult   of   an   aesthetic elite,   at   worst in impractical arrangements. Regardless   of   which   mode   is   used, a   poor   fit   between the mode   of   knowing   and   the context to which it   is   applied will result in misfiring   and   unintended consequences. We are all familiar with the unintended ecological consequences   of   the indiscriminate application of the first mode   of   knowing   and   the misuse   of   art   for political pur- poses in the case   of   the second mode. Our   dreams relate   to   the aesthetic-creative   mode   and   in   that   sense have something in   common   with art.   The   task   of   the artist   is   to enter into the life   of   another   human   being and, working with the residual plasticity   that   exists, to come   up   with the   most   aesthetically pleasing result.   The   fund   of   knowledge in the world has   not   increased objec- tively   but   the world has become a better place in which to live.

            388   Montague Ullman  Before I examine this question   of   fit   and   context more specifically around   the issue   of   dream consciousness I want   to   call attention to something   we   often pay lip service to   but   fail   to   appreciate fully; namely,   that   we   are all much less separate   than   we   think   we   are. The preoccupation   with   separateness   has   come   about   by   the   way   our personal lives have been booby-trapped by the failures   of   history. We go   about   our   daily tasks with a limited   and   often expedient view of our   connection to   all   other   members of the   human   species. Were   we to allow a   truer   vision   of   this underlying state   of   interconnectedness we   would   be   more   inclined   to   remedy   rather   than   increase   the fragmentation   and   separateness   among   members   of   the   human   species that   has been   our   heritage   and   that   we so blindly perpetuate.  Dreaming  Our   dreams provide us with   an   accurate   and   reliable way of moni- toring the mishaps   and   difficulties   we   experience in maintaining col- laborative   and   affective   bonds   with others.   Throughout   our   lives   we fight a war   on   two fronts.   On   the one   hand   are the personal assets and   limitations shaped by   our   unique life history   that   we   bring to this issue of connectedness.   On   the   other   hand   we   are caught   up   in the mix of   both   supportive   and   destructive fallout from the way   our   social institutions   and   arrangements relate to this issue. The play   of   these forces provides the battleground   that   appears in our   dreams. Failures   and   frustrations in maintaining positive bonds form   the subject   matter   of   our   dreams.   It   is as simple as   that.   It becomes more clear if   we   disengage from the way   we   have been taught to look   at   our   dreams   and   review them with freshness   and   curiosity. The little knowledge   we   have acquired, in its emphasis   on   the personal, has obscured the essence of what dreaming is all about. If   we   were to take dreams seriously   we   would have   at   hand   a reliable monitoring system   that   informs us in a precise way   just   where   our   unifying trends were at. Few   of   us are fortunate enough to fulfill   our   creative, loving, relating needs in the course   of   our   day.   Our   failures   and   shortcomings, as well as   our   successes in these areas, are what   we   dream about. Dreaming   is   an   example   of   the sensuous, immediate, embracing mode of knowing   that   we   spoke   about   earlier.   Dreams   are expressive, visionary   and   ineffable. They lead us from the present to infinity with- out   seeming to traverse either time   or   space. Our   dreams arise   out   of recent   and   remote feeling residues.   That part   of   us which is linked to others   through   feeling is more real, more enduring   and   more significant   than   other   dimensions   of   our   existence. It   compels belief.   It   dissolves distance, creates unity   and   links us to the real world. This is the stuff   of   reality.   On   the surface   our   dreams are a seemingly anarchic play of images   that   descend   upon   us un- invited.   As   metaphorical expositions, however, these images reflect the

            Wholeness   and   dreaming   389  core   of   our   being   and   the place   we   have made for ourselves in the world. I use the term descend advisedly because, for   too   long,   we   have been misled into thinking   that   dream   content   ascends into conscious- ness from   a   primitive   substratum   of   our   personality.   I   believe the opposite to be the case. We live   our   lives as fragmented individuals, seeking self-realization through   our   connections   to   a   larger   whole.   By   the   feelings   they generate   and   by the information they contain,   our   dreams can further our   effort to live in   harmony   with a universe   of   which we are only a very small   part   and   to   which   we   are connected   or   disconnected by very small acts.   Dreams   come to us uninvited   and   unannounced. They involve us whether   we   want to be involved   or   not. They are to be reckoned with, providing   we   allow ourselves to recognize their im- portance   and   do   the work necessary   to   transform information mobil- ized while dreaming into information useful   to   us in the waking state. Our   waking mentality sometimes finds it difficult to encompass certain truths   about   ourselves,   about   others   and   about   society   at   large. When :awake   our   need for security   and   concern with   our   discreteness some- times results it: a protective cocoon   that   obscures   our   vision.   Dream work   can   prod   us into facing issues a bit   more   honestly. Such work has a way   of   confronting us with   our   blind spots   and   enhancing   our capacity for involvement. Dreams   deal with facts,   but   facts   of   a most particular kind. They can be recognized later as facts, even   though   they   are   expressed in a strange language   that   is   borrowed   from the realm   of   our   visual ex- periences. This   can   best be illustrated by a simple analogy.   If you were working with   an   array   of   colours   and   wished to convey the impression they   made   to   someone else   and   had   the choice   of   de- scribing them in words   or   presenting them visually, the likelihood   is that   you would choose the visual form   as the more effective.   The dreamer   is   in much the same position.   He deals with   an   array   of feelings   that   have   not   yet been clearly sorted   out   and   that   defy verbal expression.   They   do   lend   themselves   to   visual display   where   their source in   life   experience   and   their connections   can   be seen   at   once. The   visual   metaphor   is   a   most   natural   and   effective mode   of   ex- pression   of   feelings.   For   the   dreamer   the visual   metaphor   is   best suited to   his need to say a great deal in the limited time available during active dreaming. What   is   the agency   that   provides this unending source   of   unerringly apt   visual presentations? I think   that   we   honestly   do   not   know the answer.   It   is   easy   to   gloss over   our   ignorance by attributing the source to some reified internal   demon   variously   known   as primary process, the unconscious or, simply, the Id.   The   basic question has to   do   with the   nature   of   the process involved in the selection   and   organization of   the visual images with which   we   build the content   of   our   dream   con- sciousness. If   we   look   at   this without allegiance to deeply embedded

            390   Montague Ullman  theoretical biases   we   seem to be involved in a   rather   intriguing process. We bring together a selected   array   of bits   and   pieces   of   past   data pertaining to   our   lives. We rearrange these in a spatial   and   temporal ordering   that   bears   no   relationship to their original time-space frame of reference. The rearrangement enables us to express precisely, dra- matically   and   effectively the particular interplay   of   feelings mobilized by a current unresolved life situation. Socially   available   images   provide   us   with   the   special   kinds   of building blocks needed to capture   and   express one   or   another   aspect of   our   subjective   life.   It   takes   a   rather   high   level   of   creative   and organizational ability to   tap   our   internal   computer   for the appropriate bits of information with which   to   achieve this end   and   then to re- arrange them in a way   that   can   be used as emotional templates to highlight a current significant aspect   of   our   life.   In   this respect the powers displayed by   our   dreaming selves seem to exceed the scope of our   waking faculties. The comparison   is   unfair,   of   course, since each   is supreme in its own domain. Each is a useful way   of   grasping different aspects   of   our   existence. However, we   do   tend   to   pay more attention to the one   than   to the other. This view of dreams suggests   that   we   are capable   of   looking deeply into the face   of   reality   and   of   seeing mirrored in   that   face the most subtle   and   poignant features   of   our   struggle to transcend   our   personal, limited, self-contained,   autonomous   selves so as to be able to connect with,   and   be   part   of,   a larger unity.   As   someone once remarked,   our eyes are the instruments   that   nature   created in order to see itself. So may dreams be seen as   an   instrument   that   enables us to view   our human   nature   and   the vicissitudes it has been subjected to in the course   of   our   unique life history.   In   the interest of reaching   out   toward a sense of unity each of us tunes   our   psyche to   an   exquisitely sensitive pitch in order to store   and   use what   we   have seen, heard   and   learned about   the world   and   our   place in it. At night   we   draw   upon   this store and   shape it to   our   immediate purposes. There   is   a level   and   range of creativity in   our   dreams, which for some of us come   out   only   at   night, but   for all of us are more discerningly honest   at   night. This point   of   view   is   congruent   with   the   basic phenomenologic aspects of dreaming.   Put   simply, these have to   do   with   our   ability, while dreaming, to realign   our   waking view of ourselves   and   others to bring it more in line with the reality of   our   historical existence.   Our dreams confront us with what   is.   They offer us a deeper insight into the   truth   about   ourselves. This   approach   to knowledge gives us powerful tools with which to effect   change   and   transformation.   Any   system,   including   a   given personality system, becomes more   than   it conceives itself to be when, in fact, it   is   shown to be more by the exposure   and   identification of these connecting channels to a larger reality.

            Wholeness and dreaming   391  Dream   work  What   I should like to consider next are those features   of   dreaming that   I have come   to   know   and   appreciate   through   the   group   dream work I have been engaged in since the mid-1970s. A description   of   the process has been given elsewhere 4 .   In   brief, it consists   of   structuring a small   group   arrangement   so   that   it can be   of   maximum   help to the dreamer   without   being   intrusive.   Eschewing   the   theoretical   and technical strategies   of   formal therapy, its sole purpose   is   to   help the dreamer   appreciate, to the extent   of   his own readiness   and   desire, all that   the images can convey   about   the   current   emotional context   of   his life.   The   members   of   the   group   are oriented   to   meeting the two basic needs of the dreamer.   The   first need   is   to   feel   safe.   In   order   to   feel   free to share the dream with others   and   to engage in the self-disclosure necessary,   an   atmosphere   of   trust   and   safety has   to   be generated. This is   brought   about   in a   number   of   ways.   The   control   of   the process lies completely in the   hands   of   the dreamer.   No   one in the   group   assumes the role   of   the therapist   and   the   dreamer   is   the final   authority   as to what in the   dream   fits into the context   of   his   life.   The process respects the dreamer's privacy as well as his individuality. There   is   no   im- position   of   any   a priori   system   of   symbolic meanings so   that   there   is respect for the dreamer's ability   to   use any image in highly idiosyn- cratic ways.   Trust   is   further generated by the sharing   that   goes   on   at several different levels.   In   the course   of   ongoing   dream   work everyone, including the leader, has the   option   of   sharing a   dream   and, in due course, everyone becomes   known   to each   other   at   this deeper level of communication. The   dreamer   has   another   need which the   group   must fulfill; namely, to   help him make discoveries   about   himself   that   are difficult for him to   make   alone. Various strategies are pursued   toward   this end.   The first involves the   group   members   making   the   dream   their own, pro- jecting their   own   feelings   and   thoughts   into   the   images   and   thus creating a reservoir   of   possibilities in the hope   that   some may have meaning for   the   dreamer.   At   a   later stage   the   group,   through   its questions, helps the   dreamer   reconstruct the emotional climate   that led to the dream. Then, working with the context thus elicited, they help   the   dreamer   build further   bridges   between   the   images in   the dream   and   his life situation.   The   questions are   put   in   an   open-ended way   that   leaves the   dreamer   free   to   deal with them in any   manner   he chooses. The   dreamer   is   helped   to   contextualize the dream,   i.e.   to relate the imagery to those aspects of his life   and   personality   that   they metaphorically   point   to. The   group   is   functioning as a catalytic agent in trying to make explicit what   is   implicit in the imagery.   The   reality captured   in the   dream   is   explicated into the waking mode   through   a social process   that   offers   both   support   and   stimulation   to   the dreamer. This leads to significant   and   helpful readjustments in the perceptual

Dreaming   and   wholeness  Dreams offer   an   opportunity   to set in   motion   a   natural   healing pro- cess, providing the dreamer has a supportive, stimulating   and   non- intrusive social milieu in which   to   explore the connections between dream imagery   and   life context. The essence of this   natural   healing potential derives from the dreamer's ability, while dreaming, to pro- duce imagery   that   reflects recently exposed areas   of   dis-connection   with others   or   with himself.   By   this I mean   that   the dreamer concerns himself with any ongoing events   or   experiences that, in significant ways, impinge   on   his felt sense   of   connectedness to others. Some vulnerable area   is   touched off by a recent happening. This, in turn, sets off re- verberations   at   different levels.   It   is   the recent event   that   defines the issue to be explored in the dream. The quality   of   connectedness emerges clearly in the course of   group dream work.   In   the presence   of   a safe atmosphere generated by the non-intrusive   nature   of the process, social defenses melt away or,   at any   rate,   don't   interfere   with   the   deep-level   sharing   and   sense   of communion   that   is generated.   Group   members are able to respond   at a feeling level to someone else's imagery. This   is   understandable in terms of sharing a similar social milieu,   but   it may also point to a deeper way   that   imagery has of linking people together; something more akin to a shared aesthetic response. While dreaming   we   affect a figure   ground   reversal. Awake   and   tied to the perceptual   order   we   allow ourselves to see things in their dis- creteness. The   important   part   played by connectedness, Bohm's notion of the unbroken wholeness,   is   like   an   insistent Greek chorus, dimly heard   or   not   attended to   at   all. The reversal   that   takes place while dreaming brings aspects   of   that   unbroken   wholeness,   at   least as it applies to   our   relationships with others, more closely to   our   attention. We confront ourselves with the state of   our   connections, the strategies we   use to undermine these connections   and   the social pressures   that place obstacles in the way of connections. This ability to reflect the dreamer's concern with the maintenance of connections has led me to the speculative notion that, while asleep and   dreaming, we engage with a much   broader   aspect   of   our   human nature, one   that   goes beyond the concern   of   the individual.   Group dream work discloses   an   agency   that   works against fragmentation. Trust, communion   and   a sense   of   solidarity develops   rapidly in a dream-sharing group. This concern with connections links dreaming to a larger issue; namely, the survival of the species. There has been an   unfortunate emotional fallout from the fragmentation of the   human race   that   has come   about   historically,   that   continues into the present

            Wholeness   and   dreaming   393  and   to   which we continue   to   contribute.   It   is   as   if,   while dreaming, we   are displaying this from   our   personal   and   immediate   point   of   view. If unchecked   this fragmentation   carries   within   it   the   seed   for   the potential destruction   of   the   human   species.   Only   through   constructive and   effective   bonding   can   this fragmentation   be overcome   and   the species endure.   It   is   in this sense   that   dreams may be looked   upon   as that   part   of   our   nature   that   is   concerned with the survival   of   the species.   The   individual's concern with the maintenance   of   his sense   of connectedness   to   others   is   part   of   this larger concern; namely,   that   of species-connectedness.   The   preservation   of   the individual   is   necessary, of   course, for the preservation   of   the species but, while dreaming,   we seem able   to   transcend individual boundaries to move   toward   our place in a larger whole. How   do   these considerations   about   dreaming   enter   more specifically into the constructs emphasized by Bohm?   In   a general   and   analogous way the view   of   dreaming presented here   is   more   intrinsically related to notions   of   inter-connectedness   and   unbroken   wholeness   than   are dream   theories designating reified psychic entities   at   war with each other.   Awake,   we   are   mired   in   our   own   discreteness   and,   by   the language   we   use,   trapped   by the seeming discreteness   of   all else   about us. Asleep   and   dreaming,   we   forsake linguistic categories as a primary mode   of   expression   and   risk feeling   our   way back into   an   underlying connectedness. While dreaming we explore   both   internal   and   external hindrances to flow   and   unbroken   wholeness.  Dreaming   and   the   implicate   order  The concept   of   the implicate   order   and   the concept   of   other   orders that   follow from it provide us with some admittedly speculative ideas about   the relationship   of   dreaming   to   the question of species-con- nectedness.   The   implicate   order   represents in a sense   an   infinite in- formation source.   The   manifest   order   represents the way things are, free   of   perceptual   and   conceptual limitations   and   distortions.   The perceptual   order   represents   our   limited grasp   of   the manifest field and, in turn,   our   indirect tie   to   the implicate order. Might   our   dreaming experience, with its capacity to zero in   on   a more real   or   truthful version   of   ourselves, be closer to the manifest order? Might it be, in effect, a bridge between the perceptual   and   the manifest   order   and   be closer   to   the   natural   transformation   of   the   implicate   into   the   ex- plicate? As   Bohm points   out   we   need a new language to talk   about   these transformational processes. Might the language   of   the dream, its direct sensory   approach   as a way   of   expressing the   nature   of   our   existence at   the moment, be closer   to   such a language   than   our   reliance while awake   on   more   abstract   ways   of   talking   about   our   relation to the world? Might it be a way   of   bringing us back   to   our   connection to

            394   Montague Ullman  the manifest order?   Our   senses have the ability   to   bring us   into   direct contact   with the manifest   order   but   our   personal   and   cultural condi- tioning have set   up   a perceptual screen separating us from the manifest order.   The   language   of   the   dream   is   unique in   that   it   is   expressed in a sensory mode primarily   but   without any loss   of   our   remarkable   and creative   abstract   abilities.   It   is   the   language   of   the   sensory   (pre- dominantly visual) metaphor.   Dreaming   may   be a way   of   monitoring our   distance from the manifest order, from the reality behind the way we   look   at   ourselves,   at   others   and   at   the social   order   in which   we live   our   lives. When, awake,   we   invest the time   and   energy   to   retrieve the information in those images. We are, in effect, closing the gap between the perceptual   and   the manifest orders. We come closer to the actuality   of   our   historical existence and, in   that   way, free it   of some   of   the perceptual   and   conceptual distortions   that   have accrued to it. When   we realign   an   aspect   of   our   perceptual   order   with its middle- order   correlate, we are simply replaying this selected aspect of   our   life, using a different operator.   The   result is strange   and   unfamiliar to the program   we   are   immersed in while awake.   What   makes   dream   work rewarding   is   the promise it holds for enriching   that   program   through this   exposure   to   the   manifest   order.   It   is   as   if   our   dreams   have brought   us   closer   to   a   deeper sense   of   connectedness   than   comes through   in the perceptual order. Using these concepts the task becomes one   of   defining where the position   of   the   dreamer   is   in relation to each   of   these three orders of reality.   What   has been called condensation (the ability   of   a single image   to   have   many   references), for example, may be viewed as a superposition   5   arising in   an   order   not   directly comprehensible in the waking state.   The   ability   of   the   dreamer   to link   past   and   present into a sense   of   the immediate present   may   also derive from the more tem- poral   and   spatial fluidity   that   characterize these   more   basic orders. Imaging is therefore   not   simply a primitive mode.   It   is   a necessary mode   of   staying closer   to   manifest-order reality. By bringing us closer   to   the manifest   order   our   dreams may bring us closer   to   the mystery   of   the implicate order.   It   is   interesting to further speculate   about   this possible connection   and   the light it may shed   on   the   nature   of   paranormal   phenomenon. But   that   is   another story.

            28  Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate   order and   their   release in   meditation   and   dialogue  David Shainberg,   M.D. According to   Bohm   1   there   is   an   underlying   order   in the   universe which he calls the 'implicate order.'   The   universe   is   filled with energy and   light   and   electromagnetic waves travel   throughout   the whole   of it. These waves are constantly crossing   and   interrelating with each other.   As   these waves eachÂ· encode information, their interweaving creates contrasts   and   connections   that   generate further information. Matter   is   also energy, encoded waves; it   is   the 'same' as the energy and   it reflects it. All forms   of   matter-energy affect each   other   through their participation in the whole.   The   implicate   order   is   articulated in the movement   of   this energy which unfolds   and   enfolds information. The   explicate   order   is   what   we   see as form.   Thus   the flowing unfolds into   the   explicate   order   which   expresses   the   implicate   which   has unfolded   what   was enfolded in it. In   this new   paradigm   mind   is   implicated because it   is   an   expression of   the ordering implied in the whole.   Mind   is   not   in the   brain   -   it   is enfolded over the whole   of   matter. Consciousness   and   language, like will   and   attention, are movements of the whole, parts of the explicate reflecting   that   implicate.   The   order   is   expressed in the fact   that   there are minds -   and   in the fact   that   these minds organize reality.   It   is   also expressed by the fact   that   matter   is.   Its existence   is   organization of energy. The unity   of   this   order   is   displayed in the core processes   we know as the relationship between mind   and   matter. Both mind   and matter   are projections of a higher   order   of   reality. Briggs   and   Peat   2 write: Thus   as these energies enter consciousness   through   the sense organs, it   is,   in each instant, the whole which consciousness encounters, which consciousness   (and   perception)   is   ...   and 396

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   397  processes   of   the brain are a holographic imprint   of   the whole. Therefore   both   the   order   of   consciousness   and   the   order   of matter, observer   and   observed, are projections   and   expressions   of   the implicate   order   where the two are one   and   the same. Each   is   a mirror reflecting itself.   Mind   is   a subtle form   of   matter, matter   is a grosser form of mind. The essence   of the   implicate   order   is   an   enfolding   and   unfolding movement of the whole which Bohm calls the holomovement. It   is happening in the invisible movement   that   produces all forms in the universe   and   it   is   seen in the particular forms   we   see with   our   naked eye. There are trees   and   birds   and   microorganisms, as well as millions of   other forms.   Bohm refers to these particular forms as 'relatively autonomous   subtotalities.'   By   this he means forms   that   persist in them- selves despite changes in their surroundings. But they continue to be in relationship to the greater order.   Human   consciousness   and   language are relatively   autonomous   subtotalities,   but   we   find   that   they also create   fixed   points   in   this   universal   forming   which   block   further transformations. We see the blocks in the inner conflicts of   human beings   and   the difficulties of   human   relationship   on   both   the personal and   the group levels.   As   a result   of   these fixations in consciousness, relationships between   human   beings   don't   seem to unfold   or   enfold in the   manner   that   Bohm's ideas   of   the implicate   order   imply. Instead these points become like rocks   around   which the stream of   life   moves. By   definition these fixations are   part   of the explicate as well as the implicate order. Therefore   we   need to take a look   at   how such blocks relate to the essential movement   that   is   supposedly characteristic of the implicate order. From   the   moment   of its appearance   on   the earth, the   human   organ- ism has a connection with the many different processes   on   the planet. Consider,   for   example,   the   process   of respiration.   The   lungs   are structurally capable   of   taking in oxygen   and   excreting   carbon   dioxide. The hemoglobin molecule is able to carry the oxygen molecule from the alveoli   of   the lungs to the muscle tissues. The oxygen   that   the lungs incorporate   is   produced by the photosynthetic process of the plants, which make use in   turn   of   the   carbon   dioxide the lungs excrete. When the oxygen taken in by the lungs reaches the muscle tissues in the blood stream   that   carries the transformed hemoglobin molecule, the muscle tissue   is   able in   turn   to receive   that   substance   and   to in- corporate it into the adenine triphosphate molecule.   That   molecule   is capable   of   operating in the Krebs cycle which will break down the glucose molecule, which in   turn   transmits energy in a form   that   the protein actinomysin is capable of using in   order   to   contract.   The glucose has been obtained from   the foodstuffs in the environment. The contraction of muscles expresses   and   transforms the relationship of   the organism with   other   material forms in the universe.

            398   David Shainberg  We could analyze many different systems in the   human   organism and   other biological forms   and   find   that   they also are functioning in an   integrative network with what   is   'outside' the individual   and   with what   is   'inside.' The kidneys, for example, adjust the fluids in the body so   that   they can continue to   do   their tasks in the brain   and   other organs. But they are also adjusting the fluids so   that   the balance of electrolytes   is   favorable   for   oxygen consumption   and   muscle   con- traction. The kidney   is   a form   that   establishes its definition by what it does.   What   it does   is   relationship.   In   fact all the forms   that   a"ppear in our   universe   express   relationships;   their   shape   signifies   a   specific connection to 'others,'   and   in their process they define their position - their meaning. Griffin   3   has written: A 'thing' in the basic sense is   an   occasion   of   experience. Each occasion of experience   begins   with a whole host of prehensions   or feelings   of   other   things (previous occasions of experience).   It creates itself   out   of this web of relations. Hence, the relation to other things   is   constitutive   of   the very essence   of   a thing.   Far   from needing nothing   but   itself, it needs   everything   else -   God   and   the entire past universe.   It   pulls some aspect   of   everything into itself as the raw material   out   of   which it creates itself. Form, which   we   distinguish as a separate object with   our   eye,   is   not an   isolated   definitive   outlined   thing   which   relates   to   other   such objects. Its structure   is   the active process, a structuating event,   that   is making a relationship to all   other   active processes.   That   seems like   an obvious point,   but   I think   we   pass over it much   too   quickly. We look at   forms as the things   we,   the well-defined subjects, observe as if the thing   is   there in its pristine completeness; as if it   is   only what   we   see, and   when   we   don't   see it it remains as   we   think of it until   we   return to   see it again.   In   this   process   we   lose sight of the fact   that   our observations delineate only particular kinds of relationships   and   that we   do   not   see the different levels in the relationships of   anyone   thing to everything else in the universe. When   we   delineate   our   level   of observation   we   have found the meaning for us of the thing   we   see. That   meaning fits   our   level of perception. If   we   look   at   a tree under a microscope   we   find a whole different set of meanings. If the poet looks at   the tree he finds a meaning   that   is   different from the wood-cutter's meaning. Each form, however,   is   a complex set of processes, each of which   is   in connection to everything else in the universe. The rela- tionships to   other   things are expressed by the very nature of the form itself. But when   we   come to the   human   brain   we   come   upon   a more mysteri- ous   and   complicated 'occasion of experience.'   As   a thing it   is   a set of relationships. But it   is   also a process of making more relationships.   It is   part   of the   human   organism   but   its   part   is   specifically to make connections to all the   other   parts as well as all   other   aspects of the

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   399  universe.   For   example, when the brain registers a perception of a tree the neurological impulses are the result   of   the interrelationship be- tween   the   energies   of   the   tree   that   have   become   matter   and   the energies   that   have become   matter   in the form   of   the structure   of   the brain. There   is   a compatibility in those processes   and   forms so   that the brain can register the response.   It   displays the   nature   of   what   it   is when it registers perceptions   and   forms   an   image   of   tree which it compares   to   other   images   that   it has labelled as tree. When   we   register   that   we have seen a tree   that   image has been assembled   out   of   the several different responses; the proprioceptive resonance   with   another   standing   object,   the   sensations   of   vision, touch, smell, taste   and   hearing in the wind. We repeatedly have these same   sensations   when   we   are   in   the   arena   of   the   energy   that   is arranged as a tree. The form   of   the tree stays the same   thru   storms, changes   of   season,   and   it often regrows after its destruction by fire. We see it again   and   again in the same place so   we   assume   that   what we   are seeing   is   really there   and   then we share these sensations with others who seem to have similar images.   When   we see the tree again we   remember the previous response. So the responding process seems to   have stayed the same, despite the fact   that   we have   had   many   differ- ent   experiences. We assume then   that   we are a   continuous   being, a capacity to respond, which we think   of   as   our   'self.' This 'self'   we   feel to be in connection with the   other   continuous forms like the tree. This   brain   also   connects   different   images   that   appear   out   of memory. It creates images such as paintings   or   books   which it projects into the world in material forms which   other   brains respond to. The response   of others   to   forms   that   are   projected   by   our   brain   de- monstrates   that   other   brains   make   similar connections. This adds to the sense   that   we   share a   communal   reality with   other   brains. While the lungs   and   other   such tissues are forms   of   relating like the brain, they are   more   specific in their kind   of   connection to the rest of the   body   and   the universe.   The   lung tissue, for example, organizes to perform a definite task, the   transport   of oxygen   and   the excretion of carbon   dioxide. We might say   that   we   change   our   ways   of   breathing, fast, slow, depending   on   the needs   of   the tissues for oxygen,   but   breath- ing has a well-defined kind of relationship in the reality of physio- logical process.   The   brain, however, does something different from other   organs when it connects different perceptions   and   when it sets up   new realities; while using the repetitive   neuronal   mechanism it uses those repetitions   to   make relationships between   many   different forms. It   is   responsive   both   to   the relationship between its own memories and   its creations   and   to   the relationships between those creations   and perceptions. It   is   the active process by which the organism   is   known to be   an   extended relationship beyond its contiguous boundaries. These extended relationships   of   the   human   organism, along with its flexibility,   make   it capable   of   participating in the flow   of   ordering   that

            400   David Shainberg  seems   to   reach beyond the defined states of much   of   the explicate order.   As   a structure it   is   light energy, like all   other   forms in the universe.   As   light energy it interacts with   and   is   responsive to the emanating   light energy   of   other   forms.   It   is   like a   photographic   plate, responsive   to   the   ambient   light   in   the   universe;   its   process   also involves a transmission   of   its   own   waves   of   energy which interact   both with   what   it interacts with   and   within its own energy system.   The movement of the   brain   unfolds these new connections in a reality   that is   greater   than   itself   and   enfolds others back   into   their place in a memory where there   is   a hierarchy   of   relationships as well. Despite the   apparent   flexibility in the   brain   and   nervous system   of human   beings we find, however,   that   there are numerous conflicts in human   beings. These conflicts raise the question as to whether there is   something   about   the   human   brain   which creates blocks in the flow of ordering   that   is   inherent in the implicate order. Certainly   human beings are   not   alone in   nature   in showing conflict. Trees 'fight' for space   and   light, animals kill each   other   over territory, weeds suffocate other   plants. Yet, there appears to be a balance in the system. Perhaps the conflicts   that   we   note in   human   beings   and   between   human   beings are the same   sort   of   process. But in   our   case   at   least two factors are different. First, we are aware of these conflicts   and   engage in various activities which would   appear   to   want   to reduce them, although these activities could in a wider perspective be seen   to   be   part   of   the same overall   movement   of   nature   where   organisms   in   conflict   find   co- operative connections in response to their difficulties as well as more violent ones.   But the second factor   is   that   we   have developed   the capacity to extinguish   our   species   and   perhaps the planet itself. This makes   our   conflict more ominous   and   spurs us   on   to try to understand how conflict happens   and   how   we   can find more adequate solutions to   our   situation. We know   that   numerous species have   not   survived in the course   of   evolution because they were unable to integrate in a changing   environment   4.   But   the   new   question   of   our   species   is whether   we   can   live   through   the environmental changes   brought   on by   our   own thought. The   obstructions in   human   process seem to be   part   of   the basic problems   that   our   thought   creates.   Thought   is   at   the core   of   our   re- sponse in reality   and   out   of   those   thoughts   come all kinds of further ramifications.   For   example, the responses   and   recognitions   of   the brain are often stored in memory.   When   we   meet a new situation   we   usually take   that   part   of it   we   perceive   and   make   a quick test to see which category in memory it fits.   Then   we   project   that   old model   on   the present to see if it   is   indeed the same kind of experience.   Comparing and   adjusting the two models, consciousness arrives   at   its image   of the new situation   and   then checks   that   image against the image in memory   of   how similar such situations have been met in the past. This basic process   of   consciousness   is   a moderately flexible response

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   401  to new moments. But built   into   its structure   is   a less flexible feature; it becomes   fixed   on   ideas   or   images   of   good   situations   that   have occurred in its experiences.   It   then   attempts   to replay them in the present because they worked (gave pleasure) in the past. A perception is   compared   to the memory   but   the perception   is   not   given the weight of   past experience because the latter   is   more   comfortable, fits into whole systems   of   concepts,   or   has a   program   of   action which   we   know and   do   not   want   to   change.   In   a   human   relationship   we   might meet someone who reminds us   of   someone in   our   past   and   we   instantly assume   that   this someone   is   exactly like the   other   and   we   react to him as if he were exactly like him.   Thus   when consciousness meets new situations   and   checks with memory for help in defining the   nature of   the new situation, it often depends more   on   memory for determining what   is   in front   of   it   than   it does   on   the perception   of   reality. This tendency to live in terms   of   memory   is   most   serious in   human beings whose life since childhood has been tense   and   conflicted,   and who have   not   been able   to   integrate the uncertainties   of   their reality. These people continue to focus   on   an   image   that   once in childhood they were completely satisfied   and   filled. This may be a memory from the earliest days when as infants they were without language   and   were primarily sensory   motor   organisms.   Perhaps   they knew a feeling of bliss in the state   of   physical closeness to their   mother   in which they were merged with her in a symbiotic oneness.   Then   when they come into their daily life   and   realize its imperfections, trials   and   uncertainties they are driven by the desire to recover   that   fulfilment they   had   when they were infants.   To   secure   that   security they have in their minds they will   do   whatever   is   necessary. They will kill, steal, build nuclear weapons, try   to   accumulate as much money as possible in   order   to assure themselves of   what   they think will be security. Operating in that   way consciousness becomes a block to the unfolding-enfolding movement   of   the   brain   that   connects the explicate   order   to the im- plicate. While thoughts, images   and   feelings are processes which connect 'things' in the movement   of   relationship, they   can   also   fix   the relation- ships into   specific old forms.   In   this   they seem   to   be doing   what nature   does when it repeats itself by   making   the same form over   and over.   It   makes   many   trees,   many   dogs,   many   insects   and   many   human beings.   It   makes   many   different individual varieties of those species. The implicate   order   seems to unfold templates which are as uniquely different as trees   and   humans   but   these templates are unfolded into the explicate   order   in a repetitive way. The fixation   into repetitive behavior   that   is   characteristic   of   human   beings   is   part   of   what   we might think   of   as the   form   of   repetition   in nature. We observe   that the repetition forms in consciousness when it consistently meets the present with the past.   Whether   it   is   in the form   of   repeating   an   old relationship   or   attempting to   obtain   the goal   of   a particular desire,

            402   David Shainberg  consciousness uses the same mechanism to engage the present. And that   mechanism   is   itself a repetition   of   a past event. So,   at   many   levels, and   among   them   human   consciousness,   nature   is   expressing the form of   repetition. When   compared   to the uncertainty   of   the present   and   all   that   might unfold from   a   spontaneous   response, these events   of   consciousness appear   to be quite conservative.   The   basic uncertainty of   life   calls for a brain to respond,   but   the brain seems to prefer the security of its old plans   and   programs. The explicate form -   the memory image - becomes a   nodal   point which   demands   that   a new situation becomes like   an   old one.   In   the case   of   our   daily activity   and   the necessities   of conducting   our   life this   is   an   extremely useful function,   but in   our human   relationship it seems   to   be   an   obstruction. Human   relationships are a new form   of   process in evolution because they bring together two   or   more of the potentially most flexible pro- cesses in nature.   The   human   brain   is   able to move beyond the re- petitious structure   of   nature   into   novel   interactions   in   which   new events occur. At those moments the way of   nature   is   extended, for the human   process involves a relationship to what   is   greater   than   the isolated units   of   self   that   consciousness   had   previously defined. But when   a   particular   thought   or   focus   in   consciousness   dominates   a person's behavior, this flow in   human   relationship   is   inhibited. Such foci   force   relating   processes   into   a   vortex   by   insisting   that   the movement   of   relationship stay in its orbit.   Look   at   the nuclear arms race as such a vortex arising   out   of   the greed   of   human   beings who are isolated in their separate selves   and   do   not   feel   the connection to other   human   beings.   In   their isolation they are also feeling a peculiar emptiness   and   they become greedy for everything they can get to   fill themselves. Hence nuclear industries proliferate because they provide large   amounts   of   money   and   the greed   is   so extensive   that   such people do   not   care   about   the ways they   obtain   their money   or   what might happen   from their actions   5. The   matrix   of   thoughts creates a focus   around   which there are re- lationships   that   form a vortex   and   make up a fragmented subsystem, a   'relatively   autonomous   subtotality'   which,   in   contrast   to   other subtotalities, brings   about   conflict with the larger whole. The vortex fragments off from the movement   that   is   occurring in the   other   aspects of   the universe.   It   is   not   receptive to information from those aspects. The fixed ideas organize the relationships in the present   and   bring about   a system   of   relationships   that   keep the vortex operating in a way which,   to   some extent, separates the system from the larger whole. A particular way   of   relating to   other   human   beings does   not   separate the   human   being from his organic connections to oxygen   and   carbon dioxide,   but   it may curtail his capacity to share the symbolic com- munications   with   the   rest   of   the   world.   For   instance,   professional groups   who   do   not   recognize   they   are   part   of   the   whole   human

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   403  enterprise are cut off from their connection to the creative process that   comes with their relationship to what   is   beyond themselves. In this response   of   the brain it repeatedly unfolds a form which restricts   the   movement   in   the   implicate.   But   why doesn't   this   re- striction get communicated back to the brain   and   why doesn't the brain respond to the disorder between itself   and   the ordering   of   the implicate? We might guess   that   if this form were connected with the flow   of   the implicate its characteristics would be transformed by the integration with   that   flow   and   the block would be released   and   more open relationships would unfold. But   that   doesn't happen with much regularity.   More   often   than   not   the form maintains itself   and   there   is no action by the brain to create a more harmonious relationship with reality. Apparently the agreement   brought   about   by this subsystem has   provided   pleasure   and   security which   is   communicated to   the brain as   more satisfactory   than   the   alternatives   memory   promises beyond the repetition of these safety measures. Despite psychological conflicts   or   psychosomatic illnesses the security in the repetition   is read as preferable to any change. To   gain some purchase   on   this difficulty, consider the development of   the   human   child.   He   is   faced with a wide range   of   responses in his newly-developing nervous systems; often he has difficulty in bringing them together in adequate relationship to each   other   and   to the   other forms in the world. Unless he   is   exposed to the process   of   interaction in which these responses are sifted out, his nervous system does   not develop properly   6.   If   his   mother   is respectful   of   her own participation in the flow of such responsiveness he develops a capacity for   that   kind of ordering in himself.   If,   however, the mother, as so often happens,   is caught   up in some fixed   form   herself, his   vitality   throws   her into anxiety by demanding   that   she face every new situation. He isn't yet caught   up   in repeating the remembered forms   and   is   able to respond in a more flexible manner. His aliveness expresses the essence of the unfolding-enfolding order,   but   at   the same time he   is   faced with the mother's encouragement   toward   a more focussed organized form.   In   a sense she   is   a welcome assistance as it provides him with   an   aid in ordering. But if she makes it seem   that   such a focus will protect him from the uncertainty   that   she finds in the implicate order,   and   which she thinks everyone needs to be protected from, she blocks his par- ticipation in   that   larger order. As   part   of   his   organization   in   reality every child   comes   to   his own focussing   7.   Indeed   he   naturally forms   a   self,   a center,   which focusses his relationships. But   that   focus naturally dissolves when each ordered condition opens new relationships to   other   foci   around   him. That   changing moving process   of   relating   is   after all   the essential insecurity   of   human   existence. The self   is   then a relatively   autonomous subtotality   that   unfolds in the implicate   and   is   displayed in the ex- plicate, only to be dissolved again into the implicate.

            404   David Shainberg  is   another   subtotality   and   the responses   that   flow   thru   it are   part   of the explicate   order   as well. The thoughts   and   images construct the self but, as   we   have said,   that   flow of responses in the brain includes the seductive offering which comes with the promises of security in the repetitions of memory   and   the mother's   support   for his identifying with some fixed way of living. The   propaganda   of consciousness seems to be   that   if he chooses one identity, one self, one set of plans for how to be in the world, he might find security   and   pleasure.   Under   the influence of the mother,   the child   takes   up   with   the   offering   and assumes   that   the self will be a haven of security from the insecurity which   is   inherent in the implicate   order   movement. Many   people describe the fact   that   during the early phases of their life,   when   their   mothers   could   not   understand   their   flowing   re- sponsiveness, they felt alone   and   isolated   and   thought   the world a hostile place. The anxiety of their   mother   made them   feel   that   some- thing was wrong with their responding   and   therefore something was wrong with their   self.   As   a result of   that   inner feeling in their   life   they could   not   develop a   well-grounded faith   in their own capacity to respond spontaneously to the world,   moment   to moment. Meanwhile they observed   that   if they acted in certain ways, their mother re- sponded to them in ways   that   made them   feel   better. Although they knew they could   not   trust their   mother   to comprehend their essential being they found   that   if they acted in these ways the anxiety would,   at least, be lessened. The forms of behavior which pleased the   mother and   others in their family became   an   image in their mind for how to find what little solace they could in a world   that   was   not   geared to the appreciation of the flow   that   their brain expressed. They dedicated their lives to the realization of this state   of   being which promised, if achieved, to give a measure   of   relief from their uncertainty   8. The dedication to the achievement   of   that   image fixes a person's relationship in the explicate   order   and   in some sense curtails his flow in the implicate order. This fixation occurs in the explicate   order   when genetic programming repeats itself in the formation of trees, turtles,   or whatever organism. But most such fixations maintain a balance with the   whole   movement   of the   implicate   order   and   its   connections. Operating in   that   fixation, however, the   human   being will assume   that he   is   a perfect lover   or   a great writer. But paradoxically he   feels   he  should   be doing certain things so he can prove   that   he is what he assumes   that   he   is.   And he expects other people to treat him according to   that   image. He   is   no   longer open to the flow   of whatever new connections   appear~   Instead he has definite ideas   of   what he needs to do   for his life   to   be perfect. When those ideas fail to achieve the pre- dicted results there are intrapsychic repercussions in which self-hate and   self-contempt are his   main thoughts.   As   he   thinks   that   he   is already in a state   of   being equivalent to the image, he   is   enraged   at any evidence   that   he   is   not.   For   example, one   man   felt   that   he was a

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   405  gifted writer   and   that   he could write a   good   paper   with only a first draft. When he found   that   his first drafts were   not   what he wished he would become enraged   at   himself   and   say he was   an   idiot. Clearly he assumed   that   he was, in fact,   that   brilliant person who could write a perfect first draft because otherwise he would   not   have been humili- ated by the difficulties   of   the writing.   He   was   not   interested in learning different ways   of   working   on   his writing.   Nor   was he interested   to know   why   he did   not   communicate with   his   audiences.   When   he received a rejection   of   a manuscript he railed   at   the editors because they could   not   understand   that   his work was profound. He focussed on   the limitations   of   the editors   and   what   he was entitled to from them. So the life process   of   people caught in such   an   image   is   a circular form   that   operates inside its own criteria   and   does   not   connect with the elements   of   the reality outside   of   its defined fragment.   In   this form the   human   being   is   an   explicate focus   and   the relationships   that   occur in the carrying   out   of   the   program   of   this focus create a vortex between the explicate   and   the implicate ordering. What   is   most   astounding in   this   image   process   is   the   way   the individual commits himself completely to the virtues of thought. More- over, in much   of   his   other   cognitive operations he   not   only gives great weight to   his   thoughts, he believes the thinking process to   be the central reality.   When   he names   and   describes something he feels   that he has grasped its essence. He has   more   respect for what he organizes in   thought   or   what   thought   offers him   than   for his direct sensations. The repetitive use   of   thought   acts like a rock in a stream. The vortex is   formed as a result   of   forces exercised by the form of repetition in consciousness.   The   pull to repeat the desirable memories draws all other   relating processes   of   the implicate   order   into the orbit   of   the explicate focus.   The   man   who   is   absorbed   by the fixation of his image responds to those aspects   of   reality which will enable him to execute that   image. But individuals who are caught in the repetitive process   that   makes a vortex   do   occasionally become aware   that   their fragmented con- dition   is   inadequately related to the greater whole   of   the implicate order. Responding to the contrast between the constriction of their prison   and   the flows   of   enfolding   and   unfolding   that   they find in some relationships with   other   human   beings,   or   in   art   or   nature, they are stimulated   to   try to find more freedom. Some seek this freedom in perverse behavior. Generally in perverse   sta~es   relationships are less well-defined   and   offer different connections from the image's programs. They also offer a diversity   of   form   that   moves more freely   than   the image with less which   is   bounded. They   do   not   have the necessity that   their images   had   and   they   feel   that   they can move into realms that   are   not   controlled by thought.   In   that   form their fixation   on   one image   is   dissolved when their behavior opens into relationships   of   a

Such perverse states are sought after   and   found through   the use   of   drugs, sex   of   certain kinds, masochistic practices, alcoholism,   and   other   perversions. When   we   talk   to   people who have acted perversely we often find that   they   feel   their life has   not   been   what   it should   be.   They felt trapped   in a vortex which was based   on   the premise   that   their image would give them certainty   and   security. But the contradiction between their   attempt   to   realize a fixed image   of   what life should be   and   the movement   of   the implicate   order   created a deep strain   at   the core of their being. They wanted to be relieved   of   that   strain. In   the perverse state they   feel   that   they have achieved   an   image of a state   that   they   had   projected as a relief from the strain.   That   image they have   had   in their memory as a wonderful way to be   and   the relationships projected by   that   image promised them the recreation of the time when they were infants   and   felt organized in their merger with their mothers in a kind   of   connecting   that   obliterated all separ- ations, differentiations   and   tensions   of   being.   The   goal   of   the per- version was   to   bring them back   into   the state   of   being which once existed before they became fixated in the vortex created by the self and   its images. Whereas they   had   some glimpse   of   moving into a freer realm in which they would be able   to   flow, in the sense of the implicate order, into   many   different relationships, they are actually caught in another   image   and   another   vortex. People who use perversion to deal with the dilemma of the vortices of   thought   are forced to keep repeating the same behavior again   and again. They have to keep repeating their efforts to relieve themselves of the tension because they   do   not   understand   the image-making pro- cess   and   the way they are still cutting themselves off from the enfolding and   unfolding   of   the larger order. Sometimes, however, the people who are   trapped   in the necessities of realizing their image   understand   the wider implications of their narrowed frame   of mind. They   know   that   they are fragments   that have   broken   off from a relationship to something larger. They sense that   their actions are always getting caught   up   in the image process and   that   they must somehow find a way to change the situation,   but that   it must be a way   that   doesn't get caught in the tangle of their own i.doing.' They see   that   the fixation must be dissolved   or   they must be transformed by something   that   is   larger   than   their self. Some people will take a trip to the seashore, others to the mountains or   to   some   other   natural   setting   that   enables them   to   see the difference between their fixation   in   the vortex   and   the flow   of   movement in nature.   For   people who live in cities, where the buildings   and   houses are all   man-made   and   permanent,   nature   offers a   contact   with change and   variety   of   movement   that   is   more flexible   and   clearly flowing   than is   the explicate in the city.   In   the city the lines are mostly vertical   and horizontal,   while   in   nature   there   are   curves,   diagonals   and   other

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   407  unusual shapes. In   nature   there   is   a direct sense   of   the cycles of organic growth: the flowers bloom; leaves change color   and   come   out   again in the spring; fish move in the pond; the variety   of   living processes shows the diversity of form in nature   and   the continual movement of its producing of forms. There are many different ways in which   human   beings sense the limitations   of   their   thought   and   manage to find connections to the implicate   order   beyond,   but   here I want   to   focus   on   two processes which seem to me to point   at   some   of   the essential ways the fixation in the vortex   of   the explicate in   human   relationship moves to   the openness of relating   that   is   possible in the implicate. These two activi- ties are models for how   that   process works. Perhaps a person has experienced moments when his mind   was quiet.   Perhaps   he has been with   another   person in a particular way and   knows   that   quiet   of   connection.   Perhaps   he reads a   book   about the ways to quiet his mind,   but   in one way   or   another   he gets a whiff of the knowledge   that   he   is   trapped   and   that   there may be a way to get beyond these limitations. Perhaps encouraged by someone who seems to him to be free,   or   as a result   of   other   influences, he decides to start watching his thoughts. There are many ways to   do   this in various techniques   of   meditation.   As   a model consider zazen, Zen meditation. In   Zen meditation a person   is   told to watch his breath with his thought   9.   Attentive to   that   breathing, he   is   not   trapped by thoughts or   the vortex   around   them because the thinking   just   keeps coming and   going   and   there   is   a flow of observations which seem to come without his holding to his self as the observer.   In   the midst of this insight a person finds   that   a quiet acceptance comes over him. He knows somehow, without being a he   that   knows,   that   the responses of thoughts,   feelings,   breathing   are   all   that   he   has   thought   of as himself   and   that   they are his self so much as the happening   that   is a   continual   event   in   nature.   They   simply   appear.   His   body   itself seems to   appear   continually as energy turned into   matter   which will disintegrate back into energy (nothingness) so he 'knows' he isn't his body.   It   is   a mass, a presence in   an   unfolded order; the responses seem to originate in the domain of   that   order   which   is   not   graspable by any   thought   or   image because they are all in a different realm. Yet they   too   seem to be   part   of   that   larger order, which'   we   would call the implicate order. He feels   that   he   is   some-thing   that   has been enfolded into the implicate order as   part   of   the vast energy domain and   has   unfolded   as   a   material   form   which   is   the   explicate   re- lationships he perceives. But then he knows   too   that   his perception of   thingness   and   the   conceptualization   of   his   self   as   en- folded-unfolded   is   itself   part   of the explicate   order   and   he suspects any of his attempts   at   formulation.   In   the totality of his events in meditation the meditator breaks   out   of   the fixations   that   had been

            408   David Shainberg  happening   within   his   thought   and   knows   his   relationship   to   the implicate order. As   he   watches   what   happened   with   his   breath   the   meditator   is also   becoming   more   aware   that   his   thought   process   is   quite frag- mented   and   that   it develops first one theme   and   then   another   and another.   It   creates scenarios with causes   and   effects   and   identifies with images   of   self   that   are agents   of   self in these scenarios. He sees   too that, as these   thoughts   appear, there   is   a basic identity   of   the observer and   he thinks   of   himself as this observer   and   that   observer owns all the thoughts   and   feelings he observes. But then he wonders; if all   of these   thoughts   come   and   go, seemingly without his thinking them, what   is   this   thought   that   he   is   the observer? Is   that   not   just   another thing   that   is   coming   and   going?   If   that   thought   is   also a coming   and going thought, who   is   he?   Just   another   phenomenon   playing across his brain?   As   he watches, indeed the observer appears to be   just   that, a thing, a conception,   that   is   repeated from   moment   to   moment   and without   that   he   is   nothing.   As   that   insight hits the   meditator   he sees too   that   his breathing goes   on   without his 'doing'   or   'thinking' any- thing.   It   is   a direct responsiveness in the world. It   is. Dogen-zenji became interested in Buddhism as a   boy   as he watched the smoke from   an   incense stick   burning   by his   dead mother's body,   and   he felt the evanescence   of   our   life.   This feeling grew within him   and   finally resulted in his   attainment   of enlightenment   and   the development   of   his deep philosophy. When he saw the smoke from the incense stick   and   felt the evanescence of   life, he felt very lonely. But   that   lonely feeling became stronger and   stronger,   and   flowered   into   enlightenment when he was twenty- eight years old. And   at   the   moment   of   enlightenment he exclaimed, 'There   is   no   body   and   no   mind!' When he said   'no body   and   no   mind,' all his being in   that   moment   became a flashing into the vast phenomenal world, a flashing which included everything, which covered everything,   and   which   had   immense quality in it; all the phenomenal world was included within it,   an absolute independent existence.   That   was his enlightenment. Starting from the lonely feeling   of   the evanescence   of   life, he attained the powerful experience   of   the quality   of   his being. He said   'I   have   dropped   off mind   and   body.' Because you think you have   body   or   mind, you have lonely feelings,   but   when you realize that   everything   is   just   a flashing   into   the vast universe, you become very strong,   and   your   existence becomes very meaningful. This was Dogen's enlightenment,   and   this   is   our   practice. (Reference   9,   page 103.) When   human   beings come together they have the   opportunity   for a group   meditation   on   the   way   their   common   consciousness creates restrictions   on   their movements in the implicate order. All   of   them are

            Vortices   of   thought   in   the implicate order   409  in   the   implicate   order   and   appearing   as   explicate   phenomena   in- asmuch as they are identified with their individual selves.   As   they are together they   can   see this flow   of   the unfolding   of   the forms as it manifests in their individual being. Often, however, when individuals come together in a   group   they try   to   justify their identities   and   they repeat themselves endlessly; they   want   the   other   to know who   and what they are. They express   and   defend the opinions with which they came   into   the encounter. They often   don't   allow for those fixed posi- tions   to   dissolve   and   therefore they   do   not   allow for a   mutual   ex- periencing which might occur if they were   to   share with others what they experience in their presence. The vitality in   human   relationship   is drained   of   its   dramatic   presence   and   it becomes a dulled encounter in which the talk   is   meaningless drivel given over to continuing in the vortex   of   relationships which the fixed images have created. In   a true   dialogue   between people, however, a different ambience pertains. A true dialogue   promotes   trust between people. Where there is   trust the individuals are more willing to see the frozen condition of the relationships imposed by the conditions   of   thought.   The   members of   a true dialogue pay   attention   to   this fixation   and   its vortex   and   are aware   of   the limitations it imposes   on   the   group   communion. Their dialogue seems to have originated in some awareness   of   the limits imposed by these kinds   of   restriction   on   the relationship in the im- plicate order.   So   the   members   of   the   dialogue   discover   that   their commitment   is   attentiveness   to   what consciousness is,   rather   than   an attempt   to continue the forms   into   which they have lapsed.   As   they are together they find   that   the   other   people in their   group   dialogue are examples   of   what   it means   to   be a   human   being like themselves. All   of   them have come into the dialogue because they sensed   that they are   trapped   in a   self-orientation   and   suspect   that   being with another   who   is   equally caught   up   will give them a chance to see into self-deception. This face-off shows each person the fixation in the self that   is   characteristic   of   thought   and   consciousness in all   of   them. If they are all thinking   of   themselves as separate others, they are also not   different in   that   they are all doing that.   Then   they can all become aware   that   the particular opinions of each are focusses   of   relationship and   as focusses they are organizing forces,   but   if those foci become fixation points they have blocked the contact between individuals   and therefore prevented the   group   as a whole from knowing its relation- ship   to   the larger   order   in which humanity participates. When one person holds   that   his perspective   is   the only one, he reflects the way   another   person thinks   that   he   too   holds the special perspective   on   reality.   In   a discussion where people reveal their beliefs that   they each have the absolutely correct perspective there   is   a unique opportunity   to   discover   the   nature   of   the   process   in   which   suc'h conviction takes place.   Of   course such a   group   could freeze into the opposition between opinions,   but   in a dialogue group, where people

            410   David Shainberg  are attending to the movement of thought, it is possible to see how the certainty comes into being   and   get a glimpse   of   the rigidity in such frozen points. With   that   the   group   begins to expand its awareness and   to   look   at   how   consciousness   narrows   down   on   particular structures   and   loses sight   of   how the foci emerge. When the dialogue partners see   that   thought   gets into a frozen state the insight dissolves the state   and   the oscillation   around   the vortex stops. Then they talk more freely in discussion with each other, sharing and   connecting in their relationships in a more vivid way; they relate in the freer way   that   ordering in the implicate   order   offers. In one instance one member   of   the   group   was expressing how deeply he felt that   all relationships were lacking something. He said   that   he always felt   that   any two people are locked into their particular content   and perspective. But as he talked   about   this he noticeably loosened up and   started smiling. He said   that   he had, as he talked, begun to   feel that   a connection was established with the   group   and   that   there was no lack in   that   moment. He said he knew   that   we all came   out   of the same perceptive events, the same window,   and   that   made him aware of how he   had   become stuck in his ideas   about   each person only being his particular content. He somehow knew better   about   the way in which all   of   our   perspectives were generated   and   connected to   our common   generativity. At   that   moment   the dialogue   fell   into a flowing discussion in which there was a juxtaposition   of   different views. Each individual could see   that   his ideas were   but   one perspective   on   the whole of any process. Each person knew   that   his perceptual activity was the movement which made a reality   at   every moment. We shared images, feelings   and   other   not-Quite-formed views and, as   we   tossed around   some of the different ramifications   of   these images   and   feelings, new connections   and   references came forth.   The discussion moved from talk   about   particulars to more general   and   even cosmic relation- ships   and   then circled back to the particular in   an   ever-widening circle of   connections   that   linked to   our   personal past, present   and   future, as well as to the past, present   and   future of humankind. In   that   movement   of   the implicate in the dialogue, each individual discovers his connections to the   other   people in the   group   and   to other   human   beings in general.   More   accurately put,   we   should say that   the dialogue   is   an   active connecting in which relationships are made   and   dissolved,   and   remade again in new forms each second. Then the person in the dialogue feels   that   being together with the group   is   a harmonious process   and   often begins to think   of   how he could also be in   other   places in his life in a similar   manner   if he would   but   pay   attention   to the blocks   that   occur in thought. Some- times one person reminds   another   of himself in a more exciting way; this time the reminding   is   a resonance   or   a knowing   that   he   is   part of the movement   of   the one consciousness he shares with everyone in the group.   He   discovers   that   he shares images   and   feelings   that   the

Perhaps   they   don't   even   realize   they   are having such feelings until he speaks   of   them. But from this resonating he senses their connection in   an   ambient movement which   is   finding forms they share in making. They know they are people who   make connection   to   all   parts   of   the   explicate   order   and, as   people who connect, they are   part   of   the implicate   order   as well.   The   dialogue   is   a dramatic   example   of   the way   human   life expresses the unfolding   of the implicate   order   into   explicate forms.   From   the perspective   of   a brain scientist,   Mackay   writes   10: Perhaps   the   most   characteristic conscious   human   activity   is   that reciprocal interaction with others which we call   dialogue.   I   am   not now referring   to   the non-committal alternating monologue   that sometimes passes for dialogue in   our   sophisticated society,   but   the deep-going relationship   of   mutual   vulnerability   through   which another   in a special way becomes   'Thou'   to   me   and   I   to   him. The distinction between the two seems   to   have   an   illuminating parallel at   the level   of   information-flow analysis.   As   long as someone communicating with   another   is able   to   shield his own evaluative system from the address   of   the other, he   can   in principle treat the other   as   an   object, a manipulandum, open in principle   to   full scientific specification like   another   physical object. Once the barriers   to   fully reciprocal communication are down, however, a specially interesting configuration becomes possible, in which the information-flow structure   that   constitutes each supervisory system   interpenetrates   the other,   and   the lines   of   flow from each return by way   of   the other, so   that   the two become one system for purposes of causal analysis. In   this relationship, each conscious agent becomes indeterminate for the   other   ...   as well as for himself. Each   is mysterious to the other,   not   merely in the weak sense   that   the other   cannot   gain the necessary completely determining information,   but   in the   strong   sense   that   no such information exists,   either for him   or   for his interlocutor, until after the event. There are 'interaction terms,' as a physicist would say, in the   joint state-equation, which prevent it from a uniquely determinate solution for either, even if the physical systems concerned were as mechanistic as pre-Heisenberg physics pictured them. One   of the central features   of   dialogue   is   that   it makes   apparent   that discussion between   human   beings   is   an   important   part   of   the   natural order   of   life   on   earth.   Human   response   and   articulation   of   that   re- sponse, feedback   of   reactions to   that   response   and   the clarifying of the   relationships   between   different   responses,   are   the   way   human beings participate in the flow   of the implicate order.

            412   David Shainberg  unfolds   the   different   forms   that   are   established   in   the   interaction between   people   and   those   forms   are   enfolded   back   into   different meanings of their relationships to   other   people. The movement itself is   the articulation of the implicate   order   in the   human   domain   11. Perhaps what   we   are also revealin   i,   here   is   that   points   of   order   or centers of organization are   inh~rent   to   the implicate order as it unfolds into the explicate. These points always create something   of   a vortex around   them as they provide for interactions   and   further relationships in   that   flow.   Perhaps some are more restrictive   than   others. Lower animals   do   not   have as wide a relationship in the implicate order as the   human   being, with his extensively connected   human   brain. The fixed images in consciousness, however, are themselves only a rela- tively fixed point as there are numerous relationships intertwining   and unfolding from   them, even if they   do   form   a vortex.   Even in   that condition the   human   brain   is   more extensively related   than   a para- mecium. Any form, any organism,   is   always changing   and   is   in re- lationships   that   bring   about   movements   and   change. Certainly through- out   our   universe these relatively fixed points are in interactions   that allow   for   dissolution   and   transformation   from   focus   to   focus.   In meditation   and   dialogue   human   beings become aware of their larger relationship to   the implicate order   and   it enables them to see the limitations of the point of fixation.   In   that   awareness they outgrow the restrictions in their relationship in the implicate order   and   extend their participation in   that   greater order.

The coincidence between these two ideas continues   to   surprise   me,   but   Bohm   himself added   an   even stranger twist one afternoon some years later when I   had   the op- portunity of interviewing him for a radio show. The show focused   on the possible relationships between the arts   and   science and, in the course of the interview, Bohm offered   that   he didn't see why great works of   art   couldn't also have something   important   to teach us   about the laws of nature. The possibility he raised   that   day   is   curious   and   haunting   and   in the next pages I will try to catch a glimpse of its ghost by outlining the hypothesis I found so startlingly mirrored in David Bohm's im- plicate order. The hypothesis in question   is   a way of conceptualizing   both   the structure   of   works   of   art   and   some aspects of the process which goes into creating them. Specifically, it describes the global interaction of what I call 'reflectaphors.' Reflectaphors are created in the dynamics that   takes place   among   the elements   that   comprise a work of art. In the visual arts, reflectaphors emerge in the interactions of elements like shape, line, color   and   negative space.   In   literature they appear in such techniques as irony, pun, motif, symbol   and   metaphor. Through reflectaphors are displayed   an   artwork's subtlety   and   its ability to astonish: they are the intersection between its parts   and   the whole; seedbeds   of   its 'truth'; the nexes   of   the mind apprehending   and   the thing apprehended;   and   they remain   both   unchanged   and   in process. They are the artwork's hidden order.  414

            Reflectaphors   415  To   illustrate the interworkings   of   that   order, I propose first to look in detail   at   its   appearance   as metaphor.  X/V:   two   sides   of   a   mirror  Metaphor   is   traditionally defined as   an   unusual   or   non-logical asser- tion   of   identity between two terms. Some aestheticians view   metaphor (including simile) as the   backbone   of   poetry. Aristotle claimed   that   -it is   the greatest thing by far to be the master   of   metaphor.' A sample poetic   metaphor   will illustrate why.   In   his well-known  Ars   Poetica,   Archibald MacLeish sets   out   to   tell his readers what a poem   is   by writing one. His strategy   is   to   identify the   abstract   concept 'a   poem' with a series   of   sensuous images, creating a string   of   stunning metaphors.   Through   these   metaphors   the   poet   evokes   rather   than prescribes   an   understanding   of   what   a   poem   is.   Consider   one   of MacLeish's figures: 'A poem should be wordless as the flight   of   birds.' The   metaphor   is   conventional in   that   it   is   composed   of   two terms -  X,   'a   poem,'   and   Y,   'a   flight   of   birds' - asserted to be   at   least potentially (i.e. 'should be') identical. And the mind   is   given pause. Behind   that   pause lurks the secret   of   poetic   metaphor   - a peculiar equation   of tension between terms.   For   in the same mental space   X  and   Yare   convergently   compared   and   contrasted. On   the   contrast   side,   X   -#   Y   because the reader knows very well that   a poem   is   not   a movement   made   out   of   flesh, blood, feathers   and the instinct to negotiate currents   of   air.   Applying 'wordless' to the equation   heightens this   contrast   almost to the point   of   paradox. On   the comparison side, the asserted   X   =   Y   compels the mind to stretch   out   to connect the terms.   For   the   metaphor   to   do   that   there must be enough felt similarity between them.   For   example, we might see in the flight   of   birds   an   orderly activity, a free   and   lyrical quality, a living   and   ultimately unutterable meaning   that   might be   appropriate to a poem. Might be - but,   of   course, anyone attempting to give   an   account   of all the meanings   of   this   metaphor   would immediately   run   head-on into   two   problems.   First,   the   analyzable   meanings   here   are   both complex   and   multiplex because the   number   of   discernible similarities and   shades   of   similarities between the wordless flight   of   birds   and   a poem   is   limited only by   human   imagination. Second, to delineate fully even one meaning would require actively ignoring the contrast side   of the   metaphor   -   for   to   include   that   would effectively   undercut   an.v  meaning by making us aware   that   a flight of birds   is   basically   not   like a poem.   Moreover, the fact   that   it   is   not   like a poem creates still further   meanings   which   are,   themselves,   not   fully   analyzable.   Not surprisingly, therefore, the interpreted meanings   of   metaphors   often turn   out   to be paradoxical   or   self-contradictory. The movement which produces this effect bears connection   to   Bohm's implicate order.

            416   John Briggs  According   to   Bohm,   matter   and   energy   continually   unfold   and enfold,   appearing   in   particular   (explicate)   forms   like   photons   and mountains   and   then disappearing   into   the (implicate) background. For   Bohm   this   primordial   unending   movement   from   implicate   to explicate   and   back again implies the whole.   He   calls it holomovement and   considers it primary   to   all   natural   law.   In   a metaphor,   an   ana- logous   sort   of   thing seems   to   happen   with meaning. Recently   one   of   the   many   subtleties   of   the   often   paradoxical movement   of   meaning   through   metaphor   surfaced   during   a   class discussion   of   the MacLeish lines. I was explaining   that   I personally experienced the image as a flight   of   birds in formation very high   up and   silent, wordless.   Then   someone in the class pointed   out   that   birds in flight often   make   quite a bit   of   noise, also   not   words,   but   probably communication   of   some   sort   -   and   we realized such   an   image could also fit   MacLeish's metaphor. Obviously, taking   that   angle   on   the metaphor   alters   and   broadens - in Bohm's terms unfolds   and   enfolds - one's conception   of   its meaning.   In   the movement   through   the mind of   the old conception   and   the new, one gets a taste   of   the whole. This suggests the   metaphor   is   meaning as   an   ongoing process   and perception   rather   than   meaning as the conclusions   of   knowledge.   To illustrate, consider the difference between the MacLeish   metaphor   and the statement 'A poem should be   made   of   rhymed couplets.' Evidently, the statement   is   conclusive   and   logical. There   is   no   sense   of   movement from the two terms,   no   hint   of   the kind   of   activity created by the provocative   ambiguity   of   the   metaphor.   The   statement   may   be arguable,   but   it   can   be quickly assimilated   and   filed away by the mind. MacLeish's   metaphor,   however,   invites   neither   agreement   nor   dis- agreement,   and   despite its stipulative syntax, the sentence leaves the mind in a state   more   like   that   of   hearing a question   than   understand- ing   an   assertion. Perhaps   that   is   the   metaphor's   point. Certainly it was MacLeish's point. 'A poem,' he says   at   the   end   of   Ars   Poetica,   'should   not   mean but   be.'   The   metaphor   should move the   mind   beyond the conceptual confines   of   the   X   and   Y   terms, from meaning (which   is   paraphrasable and   analyzable)   to   an   implicate-explicate-implicate   movement   of meaning   or   being (which   is   not). Amazingly, if the   metaphor   strikes the right chemistry between   X   and   Y,   even repeated encounters with it will   not   inhibit this movement. How   can this be?   The   answer may lie in understanding how conscious- ness perceives a metaphor. At   present,   neuroscience   is   only   beginning   to   grapple   with   the immensely intricate questions   of   how consciousness works. But what- ever the specific mechanisms, it seems plausible to generalize   that   a great deal   of   conscious processing (including layers   of   the unconscious and   perception)   relies   on   some   form   of   comparison   and   contrast activity   1.   For   example, a   sound   is   'heard'   against a   background   of

            Refiectaphors   417  other   sounds (the voice   of   a friend shouting above the crash   of   the sea) by a process which separates out, abstracts, by contrast, the pitch, volume, rhythm   of   one   sound   (the voice) from   that   of   the   background (waves)   and   compares   and   contrasts   it   to   patterns   (of words,   the friend's voice) recorded in memory. Memory, whether genetically acquired as instinct   or   experientially acquired as learning, lies   at   the   root   of   the   brain   movement in which the complex mix   of   reason, emotion, brain states, perceptual regimes and   immediate environmental influences unfold in conscious (explicate level) awareness as   a   stream   of   comparing   and   contrasting.   These comparing   and   contrasting activities then refold into the   background (implicate) levels   of   the brain to set the stage for further comparisons and   contrasts. In   the appendix   to   his 1965   book   The Special Theory   of   Relativity,  Bohm   considers   theories   of   perception   by   Piaget,   Gibson,   Held, Ditchburnand   others   and   conveys   his   sense   of   them   through   an elegant hypothetical illustration which I will modify   and   simplify to make the point here   about   metaphor. Suppose you are walking along a   road   in the obscure light   of   the moon. You see   an   unknown   shape in the distance (contrast: the figure to   its   background).   Initially   you   think   you   are   seeing   a   person (comparison:   of   that   shape to the complex memories   of   human   shapes in various positions),   but   as you   draw   closer you notice features unlike human   ones (your   comparison   has disclosed elements in contrast)   and you   then   formulate   a   new   image   of   what   you   see   as   an   animal (comparison)   until   this   comparison   too   reveals a contrast.   At   this juncture, still retaining elements   of   your   comparisons   of   human-like and   animal-like features,   but   confronted by undeniable contrasting elements which make this conclusion unlikely, you may compare your information to some idea you have   of   a monster   and   begin to panic. Finally, trembling   on   the edge   of   flight, you press   ahead   enough to recognize the shape as a bush (comparison   of   features   of   the object with features in the memory-abstraction 'bush'). Sequences   of   comparison-then-contrast-then-comparison   unfold with neuronal rapidity   and   flow indistinguishably into one another. Nevertheless, it   is   obvious   that   consciousness does   not   see the shape simultaneously as   background,   person,   animal,   monster   and   bush. That   would   be   absurd,   if   not   actually   psychotic.   Instead,   what   is perceived in the advance   toward   the shape   is   a series   of   advancing conclusions   or   abstractions, each held successively as a theory (and one   of   the roots   of   'theory'   is   the Greek   theasthai,   'to   see'). At any moment   the   comparing   and   contrasting   sequences   yield   apparent knowledge   of   what   is   being seen. In   poetic metaphor, however, comparisons   and   contrasts between the   X   and   Y   terms   don't   alternate; they remain in dynamic   XI   Y   tension or   balance. The   metaphor's   dynamic appears to engender the per-

            418   John Briggs  ception   that   the   metaphor   means all the possible similarities between its terms   and   none   of   the similarities.   The   categorical   or   conclusive mind   set   which   is   the   staple   of   our   consciousness   is   momentarily cancelled out. We have the vivid   and   immediate experience   that   our meanings may be viable   but   they are horribly limited. Indeed, it isn't far-fetched   to   imagine a poet writing a piece in which he approaches   an object   and   reveals in   metaphor   that   it   is   a man,   an   animal, a monster  and   a bush. Moreover, he might suggest there are also   other   possi- bilities he senses are present in the object   but   cannot   quite discern, and   that   all   of   these, in turn, reflect his own existential condition   and the very act   of   his observing so that, in the end, he   is   finding himself in the object. Meanwhile he could be revealing   that   his experience is more   than   any   of   this because it   is   none of these things. Such coale- scences   and   twists occur in literature all the time.   It   is   what   William Empson   meant   by his use   of   the term ambiguity   2. Something like this happens, for example, in Robert Frost's poem 'The   Road   Not   Taken.'   The   narrator   in the   poem   tells   about   stopping at   the place where the single   road   he   had   been traveling   on   diverged and   how he decided which   of   the two alternative   paths   to take.   In   the course   of   four stanzas, each   road   is   described in such a way as to suggest   that   every feature of the roads   is   also a feature   of   the   narrator's dilemma in living his   human   life (e.g. 'I looked   down   one   [road]   as far   as   I   could/To   where it   bent   in   the   undergrowth').   Meanwhile, though he   is   at   pains   to   tell the reader how similar the roads were, the   narrator   also asserts   that   they were different (e.g. 'the passing there/ Had   worn them really   about   the same' yet 'I   took   the one less traveled by'). This comparison/contrast, similarity/difference ambiguity   is   central to   our   experience   of   the   roads   as a metaphor. 'The   Road   Not   Taken'   might be called a central one-term   metaphor because the   narrator   never says explicitly   that   the activity   of   a   man choosing roads   X,   is   metaphorically   equated   with any   Y.   But   the tone   and   weight   of   the narrative suggests   that   such   an   unstated   Y-  term   is   present. Indeed, the fact   that   the reader can never say for sure that   a   Y   such as 'choosing one's   path   in life'   is   meant   at   all adds considerable energy   to   the   X/   Y,   comparison/contrast   tension. (Actually it's more a   harmony   than   a tension, in the musical sense of the word harmony.)   When   asked   to   respond   to   the   various   meanings   that people   had   given   to   this poem,   Frost   himself insisted   rather   sharply there was   no   ulterior meaning   at   all. It was   about   a   man   in the woods choosing roads.   In   a sense, his reaction could have been expected. Artists typically become sullen   or   hostile when asked   what   their work means. Why? Because it's the wrong question.   To   want to "know' the meaning   of   a   metaphor   indicates you're bent   on   missing its meaning. By   not   falling victim   to   the lust for a meaning,   Frost   kept his   metaphor alive. There   are   many   varieties   of   poetic   metaphor.   Some   metaphors

            Refiectaphors   419  appear   as images, as in poet Richard Hugo's line 'The sun bruises the oats gold' which   is   formed from three compressed metaphoric juxta- positions- 1   (X)   sun   (Y)   a   being   or   physical   object   capable   of bruising;  2   (X)   the act   of   bruising   =   (Y)   natural   processes which engage photosynthesis;   and   then 3   this strange bruising, as   an   action   (X)   implicitly equated in the metaphor   with   (Y)   making the oats valuable (like gold). Compression   of   several different metaphoric elements in interlocking  XI   Y   tension is typical   of   artistic structure. In   other cases, a central   X-term   may be linked serially in a piece to a   number   of different   Ys   to produce a branching-term metaphor, as in the Emily Dickinson poem where the   narrator   explicitly compares   'a certain slant of light   on   winter afternoons' to several images   and   ideas, including 'the heft   of   cathedral tunes,'   'an   imperial affliction'   and   'a heavenly hurt.' In   poems, the use   of   metaphor   as a technique   is   extensive   and   in metaphor   resides all   of   those qualities   of   vitality, mystery,   truth   and timeless excitement   we   normally associate with poetry itself. For   that   reason, it   is   important   to consider why, outside of literary context, in the world   at   large, metaphors   do   not   have these qualities. Though   general-use metaphors have a structure which also cojoins unlikely   or   illogical   X   and   Y   terms,   the   structure   in   this   case   is superficial. For   example, calling somebody a 'rat,' claiming   that   a cigarette will taste as fresh as a   drop   of rain,   or   giving the name   spaceship   to a vehicle which   plies the   regions   beyond earth's atmosphere,   are all forms of metaphor. General-use metaphors abound,   and   they can be as strikingly unusual as any poetic metaphors. But they are unlike them in one crucial respect.   In   the general-use   metaphor   the com- parison   and   contrast between the terms can be   resolved.   The general- use   metaphor   stresses the   similarity   between   X   and   Y.   Such metaphors are   dressed   up   forms   of conclusion   and   knowledge   and   so   they function essentially in the way ordinary communication does. A speci- fic   point   is   intended by the metaphor, a message -   and   once the point is   apprehended, the   metaphor   is   over. 'I saw Mrs Bradshaw today; she was high as a kite.' A   metaphor   like this   is   entirely empty   or misleading unless the listener, who presumably has a context for Mrs Bradshaw,   can   draw   an   appropriate   conclusion   about   what   is   meant (e.g. the lady has been taking drugs). In   contrast, the message of poetic   or   literary metaphors ('a poem should be wordless as the flight   of   birds') remains essentially complex and   ambiguous though, oddly, literary metaphors are by no means vague ('the sun bruises the oats gold'). They are lucid despite their rigorous disavowal   of   message.

            420   John Briggs  Literary metaphors should also be distinguished from the type of metaphor   known variously as   'root'   metaphor, 'conceptual archetype' or   'model'   3.   The Newtonian notion   that   the universe   is   a machine   is an   example   of   this type of metaphor. It has   an   'envisioning' quality because it   is   more open-ended   than   a general-use metaphor.   For   in- stance, scientists inspired by the   metaphor   of   celestial mechanics have been able to envision   and   uncover numerous mechanical-like aspects of nature. When   an   envisoning   metaphor   is   created, it has meanings which are   unknown   at   the time   and   this can make the   metaphor hugely inviting. However, in the end the invitation   is   to discern what those meanings are -   quite different from the invitation of a poetic metaphor. David Bohm,   of   course,   is   probably more aware   than   any scientist in modern times   of   the traps of envisioning metaphors.   Not   only has he argued eloquently against the way science has explicated to dis- tortion the Newtonian metaphor; he has tried to incorporate in his model a clear sense of the limitations of all scientific models, including his own,   to   provide ultimate meanings. I remember   that   during   our radio show he said he   thought   scientific theories should be presented like poetry because, like poems, theories are insights, acts   of   percep- tion,   rather   than   hard   and   fast conclusions.   In   presenting his implicate order, Bohm   is   always careful to spell   out   the suggestive rather   than objective value of his illustrating metaphors like the hologram   or   the glycerine   ink-drop   experiment.   He   is   always   pointing   beyond, showing where his theory, vast as it   is,   must shade off into more subtle reaches   and   regions   of   the   unknown   (the   super-implicate   order, higher-dimensional   realities, chaos as infinite degrees of order, the super-quantum   potential   and   the   super-super-quantum   potential), always impressing the listener with the limitations   of   the mind in the face of this vast   order   of   which the mind itself is a mirror.   In   this way, Bohm tries to avoid the   common   fate   of scientific metaphors   and accomplish something very like what happens in the   XI   Y   dynamics   of metaphors in poems.   But Bohm's understanding   is   rare.   The   very richness of   an   envisioning   metaphor   is   usually its downfall. Greedy for certainty, the mind can't resist   and   seeks to draw   out   every last ounce of the treasure until the   metaphor   collapses. Poetic   metaphor avoids this exploitation   and   eventual exhaustion (though   not   for the lack   of   critics' trying) because of its   XI   Y   dynamics   and   because the metaphor   is   set in a subtle structure of   other   metaphor-like devices which engender a pervasive order. This   order   is, as it were, especially designed to frustrate the drive   of   consciousness to analyze, paraphrase or   constrict the movement which   is   that   order's meaning.

            Reflectaphors   421  Reflectaphoric   order  There are a   number   of   reasons   to   propose the neologism reflectaphor. While it might be possible   to   expand   the existing term   metaphor   to cover the wide range   of   similar   phenomena   which occur in literary artforms, the visual arts, music   and   performing arts, like most   other critical terms in the arts,   metaphor   suffers from over-use. Extending it further could inevitably result in confusion arising from the way the critical literature   and   common   usage have conflated the general-use, envisioning   and   literary   metaphors   under the single term   and   have compounded   metaphor   indiscriminately with   other   critical terms like symbol, emblem   and   image. Nevertheless,   the   X/   Y   dynamic   of   literary   metaphor,   as   I   have defined it, has so much to offer by way   of   illuminating what   is   hap- pening generally in artistic structure,   that   I propose to retain   an   echo of   this type   of   metaphor   in a new term. The   word   metaphor   comes from the Greek   meta   and   Aryan   medhi  which mean 'middle, between,   among   and   beyond'   and   from the Greek  phore   derived from   phoros,   'to   carry   or   to bear.' The word 'reflect' comes from the Greek   re   and   flex   which means 'bending back   or   bend- ing again.'   Putting   these together, a reflectaphor can be   thought   of   as having the quality   of   carrying between   and   beyond by a   constant bending back.   One   side   of   the reflectaphor   is   carried over to the other, but   then   is   reflected   or   carried back again and, therefore, once again  beyond.   The   comparison/contrast   design   of   the reflectaphor propels this movement, bending the mind back again   and   beyond, giving no rest in   conclusion.   Between   the elements   of   a   reflectaphor   there   is   no meaning as such; the meaning   is   the continual revelation - what Bohm calls unfoldment   and   enfoldment -   of   this reflective movement. Two further   important   dimensions   of   the 'reflect' in reflectaphor will also become   apparent   as   we   probe   deeper into artistic process and   structure.   First, a reflectaphor mirrors the apprehender   of   the reflectaphor   so   that,   as   Bohm   would   say,   the   observer   becomes revealed as the observed. Second, a reflectaphor in the context of a particular   artwork   is   mirroring   other   reflectaphors in   that   context   and in fact   is   a reflection   of   the whole   of   that   context. The   first step   toward   contacting   that   larger   order   of reflectaphors   is to see   that   the kind   of   dynamic   we   observed in the individual poetic metaphor   also appears in   other   artistic techniques.   In   literature any technique   or   aspect   of   a   piece can   be   reflectaphoric;   for   instance, irony. In   'The   Road   Not   Taken,' as   we   noted, the central axis   of   the poem is   a   metaphor   (X)   roads like (implied   Y)   life.   But this   metaphor   is itself worked   out   ironically.   The   narrator's   statement   that   he decided to take one   road   'because it was grassy   and   wanted wear;/Though as for   that, the passing   there/Had   worn   them   really   about   the same'

            422   John Briggs  combined with his assertion   that   'two   roads   diverged in a wood,   and I   -/1   took   the one less traveled by' create a context   that   causes the final statement,   'And   that   has   made   all the difference' to become ironic to   a high degree. There   is   also irony in the fact that,   although   the narrator   appears   to emphasize the   road   he took, the title   of   the poem is   'The   Road   Not   Taken.'   In   irony, the words   or   situation intend one meaning   (X)   and   yet   another   meaning   (Y)   is   perceived.   If   there   is tension   or   harmony   between the two -   sometimes contradictory - meanings it creates a reflectaphor. Even   puns   can   be reflectaphors.   'Would   he   had   been one   of   my rank!' one Shakespeare character says,   and   his   comrade   replies,   'To have smell'd like a fool.'   Rank   as status   (X)   is   juxtaposed   to   rank   as bad   smell   (Y).   The   similarity between   X   and   Y   (they're the same word) emphasizes the contrast,   and   the reflectaphor   is   formed. What   happens   when   these   and   the   many   other   reflectaphoric techniques are   brought   together   into   a whole context? Here lies what is   perhaps the   most   dramatic   similarity between Bohm's theory   of matter   and   the structure   and   process found embedded in works of art. One   of   the primary models Bohm uses to illustrate the implicate order   is   the hologram. He focuses   on   the fact   that   in a hologram each region contains information   about   the whole picture which   is   recorded on   the holographic plate. If a laser beam is passed   through   different fragments   of   the plate, this whole picture will be revealed to have been   encoded   in   each   piece,   though   seen   from   different   angles. Holographic images are   produced   by recording   on   to   the plate the interference   patterns   of   light.   Bohm   says   that   since all matter-energy is   composed   of   extremely subtle interference patterns moving con- tinually   throughout   space, each particle   or   wave of   matter   and   energy contains a unique image   of   the whole. In   artistic creation   an   analogous holomovement takes place   through the medium   of   reflectaphors. Joseph   Conrad's   masterwork   Typhoon   provides a brilliant example of this   and   shows how the artistic hologram   is   formed by concatena- tions   of   reflectaphors enfolded in every aspect   of   the   story~   characters, setting, plot, conflict   and   an   array   of   expressive techniques. Ostensibly   Conrad's   tale   is   about   a   rather   dull-witted sea captain who navigates his ship   through   the unimaginable fury of a tropical typhoon.   In   actuality, the story is   about   the   nature   of   a   human   being's relationship to his fellows, the relationship   of   mind   to   matter, fate   and will, knowledge   and   ignorance,   truth   and   illusion, courage, cowardice, imagination   and   the creative act.   In   short, it   is   a story   that   implicates the whole. Conrad   depicts the   storm   which the plot   of   the tale revolves   around as commencing with the surprising oppressive placidity characteristic of   typhoons. A puzzling calm besets the ship   and   turns   out   to   be the prelude to the tempest   that   follows.   In   its context, this   storm   becomes

            Reflectaphors   423  a reflectaphor comparing/contrasting   (X)   its paradoxical placidity with  (Y)   its amazing energy. The typhoon-as-plot-device, in turn, stands in  X/   Y   comparison/contrast to   Conrad's   rendering of the strikingly un- imaginative captain whose fate it   is   to ride   out   the storm. He   is   one   of literature's most improbable heroes, described to the reader as   an   (X)  absurdly placid character, lacking foresight   and   drive. Incongruously, however, he possesses 'fiery metallic gleams'   on   his cheeks   'no   matter how close he shaved,'   and   these foreshadow   (Y)   the inner spark   and power   that   allows him, for all his perplexing dullness, to take   on   the typhoon. Like the typhoon, the captain possesses tremendous force, at   first obscured by a face   of   apparent   placidity. The captain's name - another   reflectaphor   of   the   typhoon   -   is   MacWhirr. MacWhirr   is   also juxtaposed in reflectaphoric   X/   Y   to his ship. The Nan-Shan   has 'the reputation of   an   exceptionally steady ship in a seaway.'   MacWhirr   is   described as physically 'stolid'   and   proves to be psychologically exceptionally steady in the distressing seaway   of   the typhoon.   In   this regard, the fiery gleams   on   MacWhirr's cheeks   (X)  are also a reflection   of   (Y)   the fire in the Nan-Shan's boilers   that keeps the stolid ship with her head to the wind. The   Nan-Shan   carries a cargo   of   Chinese coolies   and   they reveal yet   another   reflectaphor   of   MacWhirr   and   the typhoon.   Portrayed   as a 'languid' (placid) lot, during the storm the coolies become anything but   languid, clawing   and   thrashing each   other   in a frenzy because the footlockers they have   brought   with them have been battered open by the pitching of the ship,   and   the silver dollars which they have spent years away from home earning are flying   around   the innards   of   the cabin. At one point, the boatswain opens a hatch   and   witnesses this scene which   Conrad   clearly intends to suggest   is   a   human   typhoon. Even rolling circular dollars which the Chinese are chasing are re- flectaphoric of the 'circular storm' raging outside. All   these connections are interlocking reflectaphors in which one image, theme   or   event   is   equated with   another   to which it   is   logically dissimilar.   Out   of   the basic reflectaphor   of   the typhoon whirl galaxies of reflectaphoric relationships: captain to storm; Chinese to storm; dollars to storm; ship to captain; storm to ship; passivity   vs   activity to all of the above;   and   so   on   in manifold, swirling compressions   and combinations. Taken together, these relationships make the work a kind   of   moving hologram, a holomovement, in which each element (e.g. MacWhirr, the ship, the dollars) reflects by implication ,the whole. Moreover, this hologram partakes   of   something analogous to what Bohm calls a 'higher dimensional reality.' Bohm notes   that   in the   quantum   domain, because each detectable atomic particle must exist in three dimensions,   an   object with   10   24  atomic   particles   would   have   3   x   10   24   dimensions   of   space.   For him   this   multiplicity   of dimensions   is   a   powerful   way   to   visual- ize   his   implicate-explicate   order   because   it   means   that   each

            424   John Briggs  object   of   our   perceptions   is   an   expression   or   display of the enfoldment and   unfoldment   of   high~r   implicate dimensions into   our   familiar ex- plicate three-dimensional space.   One   might observe analogously   that each   reflectaphor   contains   two   dimensions   of   XI   Y   dynamics   and numerous dimensions of meaning. With a structure such as   Typhoon,  where there are many interacting reflectaphors, it seems possible to conjecture,   and   perhaps to observe,   that   within the explicate space of the story a matrix   of   implicate   and   higher dimensional realities are enfolded. The fact   that   each element   and   combination in the piece   is   in a similarityIdifference relationship with a multiplicity of   other   elements could also help account for the feeling   that   a great work of literature like   Typhoon   or   'The Road   Not   Taken' is always turning away from closure, even   at   its end. Closure would be the possibility of resolving the similarityIdifference dynamic -   translating the reflectaphor into a conclusion such as   an   allegory   or   symbol. Instead, for the reader there is   an   elusive sense of the similarities in the elements   of   character, event and   setting which emphasize their obviously vast differences. The   XI   Y  dynamics   and   permeation of reflectaphors create a distinct impression that   there   is   always something   more   or   other   than   the literal elements of the piece. Those elements seem always to stand   or   move beyond themselves. I propose to call this special quality of a work of   art   its 'this*other- ness' -   a neologism intended to open up a slightly different view   on the artistic process. In a poetic reflectaphor the   X-term   -   'this' -   is   asserted to be the same as the   Y-term -   the 'other'. But because of the comparisonl contrast dynamic - indicated here by the sign   * -   'this'   is   also vividly set off from the 'other.'   For   the reader, the feeling of 'this*other'   is   a movement, like the buzzing, uncanny current set   up   by the shifting poles in   an   electrical device. In the context   of   a literary fiction like   Typhoon,   the this*other-ness dynamic   exists   throughout   and   is   an   expression   of the   artwork's wholeness.   MacWhirr   is   a 'this'   but   he is also a great deal 'other'   than this. He   is   the ship, the typhoon, the Chinese, etc. Each encounter with a 'this' is a discovery   at   some subliminal level of how   that   'this' exists as   an   immediate   and   elusive embodiment of every 'other' in the piece   and   so the piece as a whole. At the same time, lest the reader fall into the   error   of taking   MacWhirr   as   an   abstraction, a symbol   of something   other   than   what he is, the dynamic * bends him   back. MacWhirr   is   MacWhirr, a 'this': the stolid captain in the story. This*other-ness   is   also   the   relationship   of the   observer   to   the observed   and   this   is   perhaps its   major   effect.   In   many artforms the elements   of   the work are fixed - words   on   a page, lines   and   colors in a painting -   yet the perceiver's encounter with the reflectaphors sets in motion a profound process of unfoldment   and   enfoldment between

            Refiectaphors   425  the terms   of   the reflectaphors in the piece   and   the perceiver's own identity. Thus, the reader   of   Typhoon   tacitly perceives the movement of similarity/difference between himself   and   MacWhirr, the typhoon, the Chinese, etc. He sees implicitly   that   in his life, in his mind   and   in the world there are all   manner   of   typhoons. In   the preface   to   one   of   his stories,   Conrad   called the effect of discovering one's identity in a story 'solidarity:' The presented vision   of   regret   or   pity, of terror   or   mirth, shall awaken in the hearts of the beholders   that   feeling   of   unavoidable solidarity;   of   the solidarity in mysterious origin, in toil, in joy, in hope, in uncertain fate, which binds men to each   other   and   all mankind   to the visible world. Finally, in its largest aspect, the reader may perceive through the story that   in the this-ness   of   the world there   is   also   an   overall other-ness,   an order   which   cannot   be contained by   our   definitions - a super-implicate order. One   more example from   Typhoon   will illustrate how the unfolding reflectaphoric, holographic, super-implicate   and   this*other-Iy   order   - Conrad's   'solidarity' -   subtly informs   an   artwork's entire structure; and   it may recall   Thomas   Mann's   claim   that   the only way to write a novel   is   'with mirrors.' The boatswain enters   an   empty coal   bunker   just   before opening the door   to the 'tween deck cabin   and   witnessing the mayhem of the Chinese chasing their dollars. In the pitch black bunker just before reaching the door, the sailor finds himself menaced by a loose metal bar,   a   coal-trimmer's   slice,   which   is   being   hurtled   around   in   the blackness by the pitch   of   the ship. The boatswain has the distinct impression   that   this piece of metal   is   trying to catch him   and   kill him. Finally, as if by blind luck, his   hand   falls   upon   the slice   and   he   is   saved. A moment later, he opens the   door   to the 'tween deck. Here, rather than   being chased by pieces   of   metal, the Chinese are trying to catch metal pieces (their rolling dollars) which by a seeming blind luck keep slipping from their grasp. The ostensible reasons for these cat-and- mouse chases between   man   and   metal are manifestly different (the boatswain wants to save himself from being battered to death by   an unseen force; the Chinese want to secure their possessions).   Or   are they so different? The scene   is   like a chemical solution mixing these reflectaphors with others in the story having to   do   with blindness, circularity   and   luck   or   fate. This illustration   and   the others from   Typhoon   are far from untypical of   the piece as a whole   and   represent only a very small sample   of   its total reflectaphoric connections (a 'higher dimensional' total, probably impossible to calculate).   One   does   not   need to assume   that   Conrad was consciously aware   of   these connections   or   that   he intended them -   though there   is   good evidence   that   he was well aware   of   the prin-

It   should also be noted   that   not   all novels have the direct mirror- type   of   reflectaphors exhibited by   Typhoon.   In   fact every great artist finds his   or   her own approach   and   techniques for the expression   of this*other-ness so   that   the variety   of   reflectaphoric structures   is   an immense   and   fascinating subject in itself.

            Refiectaphors   427  One   should also   not   infer   that   a work   of   art's   greatness   is   to   be measured   by   the   sheer   complexity   or   quantity   of   reflectaphoric permutations. Even a single, simple reflectaphor can be enduring, as Matso   Basho's haiku: One's life, a single dewdrop. Its lonely savor.  Umbrella   terms  In   the   art   of   painting, reflectaphors exist   on   a   number   of   levels   and are   articulated   through   numerous   techniques.   For   example,   re- flectaphors   can   be created when a painting   of   one thing looks sub- liminally like   another   -   a building   that   looks subtly like a face,   a range   of   mountains   that   is as sensuous as a reclining body. Reflectaphors occur   most   intensively, however,   among   the shapes, colors   and   lines   of   the painting. This can be seen readily in a relatively simple Chinese portrait, after   Kao   Ch'i-p'ei   (AD   1672?-1734), called 'Man   With Umbrella' (see Figure 29.1). Let us begin to explore the this*other-ness resonance in this paint- ing with the shape which appears as the   top   of   the man's umbrella, abstracted thus: This   shape   is   echoed   reflectaphorically   throughout   the   paIntIng. Notice   that   it   is   in the   hat   strapped   to   the man's back; in the notch   of his front   pant   leg; in the   notch   between the rear   and   front   pant   leg; in the shape   of   the   shadow   under   the arm; in the   top   ~   of the bridge (where the entire figure   of   the   man   himself might be viewed as something like the   dot   on   the umbrella peak). Each   of   these variations   is   slightly different from the   ~   of the umbrella, different enough   probably   to pass unnoticed as reflections. For   instance,   note   the   comparison/contrast   created   by   the  ~   r'\   lines which form the bridge the old   man   is   walking across. These shapes are a kind   of   X/   Y   between the Euclidian triangle composed   of   straight lines (like the umbrella)   and   the Riemannian triangle   made   of   curved lines. This   ~ /   0   reflectaphoric tension is   maintained   throughout   the piece in numerous variations.   In   these permutations   of   permutations   of   the basic   ~   shape, the viewer   is no   longer following actual lines   but   tracking lines   of   force created by   the   overall   composition.   This   suggests   another   kind   of   visual reflectaphor   at   work.   Look   at   the   shape   formed   by   the   line

Between the armpit and   the nape   of   the neck this line   is   not   filled in,   but   is   suggested by the faint upward thrust in the   armpit   shadow which draws the eye toward the heavy   dark   spot   at   the neck. Here the line which begins   at the rear   pant   leg   and   ends   at   the neck   is   itself a kind of reflectaphor; that   is,   though it   is   'this' (a line) it   is   also many 'other' things -   a trouser leg, a shadow, a belly   and   chest,   an   armpit   and, for a while, between   the   arm   and   neck,   nothing   at   all.   Each   ~   is   re- flectaphorically   both   there   and   not   there since each figure's lines are also lines   of   other   triangles,   other   parts of the composition. Thus, while the this*other-ness spreads   an   implicit recognition of the   ~  everywhere, it keeps its distance so the similarities are never over- stressed   or   conclusive. The painting   cannot   be resolved into a clever collection of   ~   shapes. Each variation blends into the others, appears   and   vanishes into the overall picture. Yet the presence of these reflections contribute to the deep sense   of   coherence in the piece. These, of course, are formal elements.   But there are other quite important   aspects   to   this   painting.   How   do   they   fit?   One   might wonder, for example,   about   the this*other-ness of   an   old   man   crossing a bridge hung in space. And what   about   the old man's character? Is that   reflectaphoric, as well? Leonardo   da   Vinci's   'Mona   Lisa'   is   perhaps   the   most   popular example of portraiture in the history of painting   and   can be taken as exemplary   of   the reflectaphoric effect of creating character by visual means. Albert Rothenberg notes   that   over the centuries critics have described the   Gioconda   smile as   both   'good   and   wicked,' 'cruel'   and 'compassionate,'   'the   smile   of the   Saints   at   Rheims'   and   "worldly, watchful and self satisfied,' a look of   both   'modesty   and   a secret sen- suous joy.'4 Leonardo evidently created in this smile a this*other-ness in which various psychological states were reflectaphorically related.   In   that particular remarkable smile, which   is   Mona   Lisa's   and   no   other's, something   universal   about   the   nature   of   human   passion   shines through. Something similar   is   happening with the old   man   on   the bridge - something conveyed by his expression   and   the attitude of his body. Could one say what his character   is   in the instant of the paint- ing?   determination?   resignation?   sourness?   humor?   combativeness? Or   should   we   say   that   the painting has somehow penetrated   and   found the   common   ground   for the structure of all those different emotions (and more)? Yet the   man   with the umbrella   is   not   an   abstraction, a

            Refiectaphors   429  human   generality. He   is   a particular, unique presence. The painter has expressed through line   and   simple shape the sense   that   this   man crossing a bridge stands beyond himself,   that   his lines extend   outward to touch the solidarity   of   humanity   and   being. It   is   as if his indivi- duality were somehow founded   upon   his universality; as if the viewer's sense of his universality were founded   upon   the old man's uniqueness. Like the   narrator   choosing roads in the   Frost   poem, the situation of the   man   with the umbrella   is   charged so that, even though   we aren't told this   is   a reflectaphor whose terms are   (X)   the old   man crossing the bridge with   (Y)   our   own life,   we   perceive   that   it   is.   And in so far as   we   are disposed to assign meaning to the painting, the expression   and   attitude   of   the old man's body has something like the effect of the irony in 'The   Road   Not   Taken.' Each time   we   think we've got it,   we   must see we haven't. With paintings, however,   we   generally don't   assign meanings, not consciously, anyway. In   fact, in talking   about   'Man   With Umbrella' I have made explicit aspects which remain implicit for most viewers   and   were probably so for the artist in the act of making his creation. However, that's   not   to say either   that   the implicit   is   not   real   or   that   by making it explicit   we have come any closer to understanding the actual   'truth'   of the piece. That   'truth'   must   ultimately   lie   in   the   mysterious   realm   of what brought all these reflectaphors together in the artist's mind   and   in the poignant movement   that   takes place when they are encountered by a viewing consciousness. Some reflectaphors, like 'the sun bruises the oats gold,' depend   upon   being explicit   and   shocking; others, like the bunker   scene in   Typhoon   and   the   ~   of   'Man   With Umbrella,' remain implicit for their effect. The relative degrees   of   explicitness   or implicitness; the types of techniques used to express the reflectaphors and   the reflectaphoric combinations (e.g. irony, metaphor, pun); the types   of   reflectaphors inherent in each genre   and   artform (the gestures of dance; contrast   and   tonalities in black   and   white photography; the conceptual quality   of   words) all have quite different effects   on   the observing consciousness.   Yet they   have a similar effect as well:   to create a sense of a this*other-ness order, a moment of uncanniness where, as   Heidegger said, one comes into immediate contact with being. The whole issue   of   explicit   and   implicit can be illuminated by an- alogy to Bohm's assertion   that   explicate forms like electrons are also implicate   and   that   the strangenesses of   quantum   mechanics - such as the puzzle   that   the electron can be   both   particle   and   wave - are really symptoms   of   the fact   that   implicate   and   explicate are two sides of the same coin.   Our   minds prefer to see one side   or   the other. The power of a great work   of   art   is   that   it gives   both   sides simultaneously. Im- plicit   and   explicit converge.   That   is   the meaning of the this*other-ness order   and   a   major   function of the   XI   Y   dynamics.

            430   John Briggs  In   the   creative   mind  Modern   abstract art, photography, dance, music -   all artforms   and styles find ways to express   that   order. Composer Igor Stravinsky, in his   Poetics   of   Music,   noted   that   for him 'variety   is   valued only as a means of attaining similarity'   5.   In   his   Norton   Lectures   Leonard   Bern- stein defined compositions of the Romantic era as having what he called 'extrinsic metaphor,' in   that   melodies   and   instruments are used to refer to objects   or   processes like birds, brooks, characters. He also noted   a   more   general feature   of composition, 'intrinsic metaphor,' where a set of notes becomes varied so   that   the variations are, in effect, compared to each   other   6.   In   'serious' music, regardless of sty- listic, cultural   and   historical changes, a reflectaphoric order appears. A composer once remarked to me   that   he   thought   of the notes in a musical composition as forming   'a   little expanding cosmos with its own laws   and   forms, like   our   cosmos.' But in saying this, one very much wants to avoid implying   that reflectaphoric   order   is   some   s~btle   principle by which   an   artist gene- rates, more   or   less mechanically, variations of the same thing. Just as Bohm says   that   for the physical universe it will be impossible to formu- late a general law   of   the whole, in the reflectaphoric universe a general law for constructing reflectaphors will   not   be possible. This   is   because reflectaphoric   order   unfolds   to   undercut   the   very   processes   and machinations   of   thought. An experiment in perception will help illustrate this   point.   It   is known   that   if persons are subjected to a single brief tone (or touch) recurring   at   fixed,   short   intervals   of,   say, a second   or   so apart, the series   of   sounds   very   quickly   becomes   perceived   as   rhythm,   even though, objectively, no rhythm exists.   In   the days before digital clocks people   had   direct experience of this -   the   tick tick tick sound of a clock becoming in the mind a tick-tock pattern. The brain, it would appear,   is   a kind of patterning device.   Further   evidence for this   is   as near as one's habits. On   the   other   side, research has shown how quickly a pattern, once established, falls into the background of conscious awareness in the phenomenon   of   'habituation.'   In   habituation,   brainwave   responses begin to flatten   and   arousal diminishes   until   the   pattern   is   hardly noticed   at   a1l   7 ,   or   until a trance-like state occurs in which   at   least some levels   of   the brain are dulled, as happens with patterns used to induce   hypnosis   and   with   narrowly   rhythmic   music   (rock   music, chants). Taken together, these observations suggest what may be happening with reflectaphors.   In   a   Beethoven symphony,   in   'Man   With   Um- brella,' in   Typhoon   and   in 'The   Road   Not   Taken' the brain's craving for establishing a patterned   order   is   satisfied by the constant display of similar items:   at   the same time arousal   and   alertness are maintained

            Reflectaphors   431  and   habituation   suppressed by the fact   that   these variations unfold in always unpredictable ways -   that   is,   by the law   of   comparison/contrast which makes each figure (even after repeated encounters) cognitively dissimilar from the last.   The   reflectaphoric figures create   an   alertness in consciousness and, in a sense, this unfolding alertness   is   itself the order. It   therefore   follows   that   such   an   order   cannot   be   produced   or comprehended mechanically.   For   example, as we   noted   earlier, in a poetic metaphor, to achieve the   proper   X/   Y   tension, the terms have to be close enough together for   an   observer to perceive their similarities yet   far   enough   apart   to   create   an   enduring,   perhaps   astonishing, contrast.   How   could one determine mechanically what the   proper   dis- tance   is   to   achieve   that   spark?   As   Jorge Luis Borges says, the terms of a   metaphor   must be "precise': I always remember   that   wonderful line in a poem by Emily Dickinson, which can exemplify this: "This quiet   dust   was gentlemen   and   ladies.'   The   idea   is   banal.   The   idea   of   dust, the dust of   death (we will all be dust one day),   is   a cliche;   but   what surprises   is   the phrase 'gentlemen   and   ladies,' which gives the line its magic   and   poetic quality. If she   had   written "men   and   women' it would have failed as poetry, it would have been trivial.   8 There   is   a   further   complication   to   codifying   this   proper   distance between the terms: the effect   of   context.   Many   reflectaphors which make little sense   or   altogether   too   much "conclusive' sense outside their literary context (poem, play, story) have exactly the right sim- ilarity/difference   harmony   within   that   context. Example: Shakespeare's lines 'This above all, to thine own self be true/And it must follow as the night the   day,/Thou   canst   not   then be false to any man.' Outside the play, this has become the most banal sort   of   conclusive aphorism.   In the play's context, however, it   is   said   by   Polonius who   is   false   to everybody -   and   so the lines are reflectaphorically ironic.   To   the extent that   we   do   become   habituated   to great works   of   art, it's when   we   take things   out   of   context   or   allow   our   conclusions   about   the piece   to shut off active perception   of   the reflectaphoric movement. Thus, it   would   be   an   unproductive   paradox   to   assume   that   re- flectaphors could be generated by some scheme   or   formula. If it were possible to recognize   and   predict the pattern, the mind would become habituated   to the structure   and   the structure would fall from   this* other-ness into   conclusion.   As   Frost   insisted,   "No   surprise   for   the writer,   no   surprise for the reader.' Creators know well   that   attempting to generate   an   artistic reson- ance   or   reflectaphor   by   analytically   or   premeditatively   balancing terms unavoidably collapses into confusion   and   arbitrariness.   Most artists are quick to point   out   that   any choice of words, lines   or   notes can   be   "justified'   on   some   aesthetic,   emotional,   rational   or   other

            432   John Briggs  grounds,   but   that   for each moment   and   position in the piece it   is   not the most justifiable choice which counts.   It   is   the one which 'works.' There   is   about   the   discovery   of   a   good   reflectaphor   a   stochastic quality, as   unexpected for   the   artist as   if he   had   just   fallen   off a ledge (though sometimes a subtle one),   but   then in midair seems to remember the ledge was always there. When a creator has tumbled over the edge   and   finds himself flung along the iron flight-path of his 'right' choice - Wordsworth called it the 'inevitable' choice - he feels paradoxi- cally free. Creators have long maintained   that   creativity   is   impossible to teach.   Can   you teach someone how always to   tumble over the rules without yourself making rules which would have to be tumbled over?   As   Aristotle said of metaphor, it is 'the one thing   that   cannot   be learned.' But why do artists make reflectaphors?   What   is   their felicity in the creative act?   Many   creators have said a piece begins for them in some- thing vague,   amorphous   or   objectively insignificant; a trivial object, a memory, silly melody, idea   or   a fusion of these which uncannily floods the artist with the impression   that   it contains somehow   an   immensity, perhaps all the world. Perhaps it   is   a vision of the whole universe   and the artist's relation to it. Perhaps it   is   a vision of what   Conrad   called 'truth.'   As   one sculptor described it to   me: At times there emanated from people almost palpable extensions of themselves,   and   certain objects possessed a special dimensionality. A small puddle iridescent with spilt oil   and reflecting a patch   of   midwestern sky would suddenly expand for an   endless split-second to encompass my entire universe. This glance of this*other-ness becomes for the artist a touchstone   or what Henry James called a 'germ'   out   of which the piece evolves. The germ might also be   thought   of as something which serves the artist as a sudden window, opening between the explicate   and   the implicate. The evolution   of   the piece   out   of   that   germ (a process which   Frost described as like ice riding   on   its own melting)   is   a.   reflectaphoric evolution, each element emerging in   XI   Y   tension with others. In a peculiar   and   often quite indirect way, the inspiration for the creation and   the thing created began to mirror each other. The initial per- ception   is   that   some one element - idea, memory, melody - contained the whole, and, in the end, the creator produces a form in which each unique element reflects the whole of the piece. Then, since each element in the piece stands   or   moves beyond itself, the piece as a whole stands beyond itself -   which, again,   is   in keeping with the standing-beyond quality of the piece's inspiration   or   germ. The artist's   biography also enters   strongly into   this   process.   As Rothenberg has pointed   out   4,   many elements of creative works arise out   of superimposing remembered   or   personal experience   on   to the constraints   of the   piece.   For   example,   in   creating   a   character,   a

In   the case   of   a photographer, a tension exists between the external scene being   photographed   and what Ansel Adams calls the internal   or   imagined 'visualization'   of that   scene.   There   is,   therefore,   in   the   creative   process   an   ongoing similarityIdifference dynamic   between   (X)   the forces   of   the   artist's personal experience   of   the world   and   (Y)   the material   of   his invention. The fateful balancing   of   this unfolding   XI   Y   (which   can   become ex- ceedingly complex) enters into such   important   issues as finding the proper   'distance'   on   the piece, attaining   an   authentic 'persona'   or   style and   achieving the   appropriate   voice   or   tone for the work. In   the evolution of the artwork, the artist doesn't   make   choices according to some analyzable logic   or   pattern,   but   chooses elements that   feel   'right,' in   harmony   with the this*other-ness   of   the germ.   In this process the particular, the individual - the puddle iridescent with oil, the two roads in the woods,   Captain   MacWhirr, the artist's own life   -   becomes the universal. The   universal, in turn,   is   revealed as something immediately present to   our   senses -   the place where im- plicate   and   explicate have coalesced.  {In)conclusion  Those familiar with   David   Bohm's theory   of   the implicate   order   may be as surprised as I was   to   find such correspondence between a scien- tific theory   and   a purely aesthetic one.   Bohm   has proposed   that   matter and   energy are holographic -   that   information   about   the whole   is enfolded in the interference patterns   of   the   matter   and   energy waves which instantiate space   and   time. He has also proposed   that   the universe is   multi-dimensional   and   flowing   and   that   in it the observer   is   the observed. A reflectaphor could also be viewed as a kind of interference pattern, created by the reverberations   of   the colliding   XI   Y   terms   and producing   an   unfolding   and   multi-dimensional reality. However, in- stead   of   unfolding into -   and   as - space   and   time, reflectaphors unfold in holomovement to instantiate for the observer of the   artwork   that he   is   essentially what he observes -   every reader is, in some sense, MacWhirr;   we   are all the old   man   on   the bridge. And the artists who created them were also those figures. (But perhaps in such discoveries lies the secret meaning for us   .of   space   and   time.) Creative   artists   who   know   anything   about   David   Bohm's   work usually recognize immediately   that   he has envisioned a physical uni- verse which   is   congenial   and   familiar, one which has been echoed be- fore in aesthetic ideas like Aristotle's concept   of   the dramatist inspiring, 'pity   and   fear,'   T.   S.   Eliot's 'objective correlative,'   Keats'   'negative capability,'   the   symbolists'   'correspondences,'   Nicholas   of   Cusa's

            434   John Briggs coincidentia oppositorum.   It   is   a universe where, in William Blakes' words, one   can   'see the world in a grain of sand' -   or   a pair of roads, a typhoon,   an   old   man   crossing the bridge with   an   umbrella.   It   is   a universe   that   would have been recognizable to   da   Vinci who wrote in his   journal   that   'every body placed in the luminous air spreads   out   in circles   and   fills the surrounding space with infinite likenesses of itself and   appears all in all   and   all in every part.' Bohm   brings   new   light   and   considerable   force   to   these   ancient artistic visions. But   we   began by asking if the artistic vision can   add anything to   our   contemplation of the physical universe. The question   remains   open.   I   can   offer   here   only   a   few   vague intimations. The holographic   and   reflectaphoric perspectives are strikingly simi- lar   but   by   no   means exactly the same. The difference raises a number of questions.   Could   physical   reality also   be   reflectaphoric;   that   is, based   on   an   X/Y   dynamic such as is found   in works of art?   For example, could such   natural   relationships as   man/other   men,   man/ objects, objects/energy derive their vitality, perhaps even their very being, from a similarity/difference dynamic? Certainly there   is   ample evidence   that   similarity/difference   is   involved in the shape of the physi- cal world:   DNA   unfolds the similarity/difference dynamic in all living creatures; the way ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny suggests this vital harmony   and   tension; matter-energy exchange suggests it.   In   the con- sciousness of   human   beings appreciation of this dynamic   is   obscured by   our   tendency   to   view things as either similar   or   different   and   to introduce causality to explain away the fact   that   everything   is   similar and   different simultaneously. Taking a reflectaphoric   approach   might affect the way in which   we   classify natural objects   and   transform the meanings which   we   give to   our   classifications. The   reflectaphor   is   a   hinge   between   the   explicate   order   of   our familiar reality (the grain of sand)   and   the implicate   order   (the whole implied by the sand). If   we   were to observe objects   around   us as grains of sand, as this*other-nesses, could this provide a new perspective into what   is   happening   at   the   quantum   level?   In   evolution? Should   our scientific   explanations   of   natural   phenomena   have   a   comparison/ contrast dynamic between implicate   and   explicate; between analysis and   what lies beyond analysis? Bohm himself has been   an   advocate of this position. If   we   were to take such   an   approach   seriously, how would the universe   appear   to us   and   how would   we   perceive nature's laws?   Might,   for   example,   the   unknown   then   become   a   vivid dimension of   our   experience of the   known   - similar to what happens in   metaphor   when the   unknown   emerges   out   of the junction between the two known terms?   In   a work   of   art, only when the unknown   or ambiguity   is   present does one implicitly perceive the whole of the piece -   and   the whole beyond the piece.   What   would be the role of the ob- server   and   the observed in such   an   X/ Y   relationship?   For   ages artists

            Reflectaphors   435  have been portraying the physical world as a reflection of the mind, heart   and   soul of   human   beings -   and   vice versa (e.g. the Chinese chasing dollars are the typhoon).   What   if the artists are right   and   the world   around   us   is   literally a   mirror   of   our   minds? Deep within the similarity/difference   of   physical things   is   there a   natural   law as   broad and   rigorous as the law   of   gravity   but   governing what   Conrad   meant by the 'solidarity   ...   which binds men to each other   and   all   mankind to the visible world'? Many   people have been surprised by David Bohm's thesis for vari- ous reasons. Some have been surprised by its elegance; some by its sweeping grandeur; some by its perfect aptness to their field   of   interest. There are even some who are surprised   at   how much they dislike it. In   my case, I was surprised to discover someone in science who saw the world as   an   artist does; a scientist who   had   found a creative rather than   a   random   universe; a scientist who found in nature a continuous mystery allied with a continuous meaning. But perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised because, after all, artists   and   scientists   do   have in common   a fascination with   our   sensual world -   and   both   are driven to discover in its immediate   and   apparently chaotic phenomena some glimpses   of   enduring order.

            30  Meaning   as   being   in   the implicate   order   philosophy   of David   Bohm:   a   conversation  Renee Weber   Rutgers, the   State   University   of   Nea' Jersey Weber   You are more   and   more interested in meaning, so can   we explore   what   meaning   is;   not   the definitive essence of it,   but   why are you interested in it?  Bohnl   I   am   interested in meaning because it   is   the essential feature of   consciousness, because meaning   is   being as far as the mind   is   con- cerned.  Weber   Is   meaning being?  Bohm   Yes. A change   of   meaning   is   a change   of   being.   If   we   say consciousness   is   its content, therefore consciousness   is   meaning. We could widen this   to   a   more   general kind   of   meaning   that   may be the essence   of   all   matter   as meaning.  Weber   We   understand   the idea   of   meaning in the   human   world,   but how   can   it apply   to   the   non-human   world?  Bohm   There are several ways   of   looking   at   it. Let's take the   notion   of   a cause.   Now   we   know   that   Aristotle   had   four notions of causation; of these, the material   and   the efficient cause are still recognized by modern   science.   The   other   two, the formal   and   the final cause, are not. But if   we   could bring in this   notion   of   the formal   and   the final cause,   we   might say   that   the form   that   a thing has   is   its cause   and also its aim, its goal, its end. The two go together.   If   we   think   of the dynamics   of   the establishment   of   form, it requires some sort   of end   in view, so the formal   and   final cause must go together. This   is also the basic essence of Rupert   Sheldrake's idea of the formative cause [ed. in Sheldrake's   A New Science   of   Life: The Hypothesis   of Formative Causation].   The   formative cause   is   basically very similar to meaning. Meaning operates in a   human   being as a formative cause: it   provides   an   end   toward   which   he   is   moving;   it   permeates   his attention   and   gives form to his activities so as to tend to realize   that end. 436

            Meaning as being   437 Weber   So   we   could say, using   an   Aristotelian example;   just   as the acorn moves   toward   oakhood   and   stops growing when it reaches the oak   and   then continues   to   maintain its oakness, in   an   analogous way when a   human   purpose   is   achieved in   an   action,   that   action ceases and   becomes something else. You are proposing this analogy?  Bohm   Yes,   not   only   to   create the thing,   but   to sustain it. The final cause   is   not   only   to   become   an   oak,   but   to   remain   an   oak, to carry out   all the activities   that   are required to continue to be the oak.  Weber   Is meaning still applicable there?  Bohm   Yes, because meaning   is   to   sustain   your   existence rather   than to change it.  Weber   The   problem   is   this:   in   giving   that   explanation,   you   are already   using   a   teleological   framework.   Suppose   scientists   do   not accept   that   and   say   that   the development   can   be explained in terms   of   the first two causes only,   i.e.   the material cause   and   the efficient cause?  Bohm   Well,   that's   a   rather   limited range,   and   it wouldn't serve to explain   quantum   mechanics, which   is   fundamental.  Weber   In   what way would it fail to explain it?  Bohm   Quantum   mechanics has   no   causal explanation.   It   is   supposed to be one   of   its virtues   that   it   is   entirely   random   and   statistical   and therefore there   is   no explanation. It has   no   explanation   of   tinze,   how one   moment   becomes another.   That   is,   quantum   mechanics   is   a theory of one moment,   of   one measurement,   and   there's a statistical prob- ability of getting a certain result.   Then   you   drop   whatever you have done   and   start   out   with the next measurement,   and   apply statistics again. It does   not   explain how you get from one measurement to the other   or   in fact why   or   how any measurement produces the result that   it does.   It   says the formula   will give you the probability   and that's all there   is   to it.  Weber   But   then   you   don't   have   efficient   causation   in   quantum mechanics,   or   even material causation.  Bohm   In   a way, that's what they say. You have no causation except a statistical one   or   perhaps, in Heisenberg, who has   put   in the idea of potentiality. But   that   does   not   make the causation very clear; it   just says in some vague sense   that   the potential   is   capable   of   acting in a certain \vay   and   gives the statistics   of   that   action.   It doesn't really discuss cause as such.  Weber   Isn't   that   all   the   more   reason   for   someone   not   to bring in the formal   and   final cause? If   quantum   mechanics says there is   no justification for   any   kind   of causation, why bring it in   at   all?  Bohm   What   kind   of   justification does one want? Simply to say   that quantum   mechanics has been unable   to   give a cause of it? I would have   an   explanation   of   the electron in the following terms: it   is   con- stantly forming   and   dissolving in a similar way,   and   what   is   behind it is   this formative cause;   that   is,   a formal   and   a final cause constantly tending to form.

            438   Renee Weber Weber   How   do   you visualize that?  Bohm   We might   think   that   the   present   wave function   is   the   de- scription   of   a very small   part   of   the formative field   of   the electron,   or the system. This,   at   any rate,   is   my suggestion.   Quantum   mechanics has narrowed   down   what   it   can   discuss   and   says:   that's   all.   Nothing else exists,   and   that's   all   that   can   possibly be studied. I'm proposing that   we   study something else; for example, the   succession   of   events. Let us interpret the wave function differently as representing a de- scription   of   the formative cause,   but   as having some sort   of   meaning which would also tie in with   things like the non-local correlation. There would be a meaning connected with the whole system as well as with   anyone   part.  Weber   Where would the formative cause   and   the meaning come from?  Bohm   Where does the wave function   come from?   It's   just   simply proposed by Schrodinger   and   a   few   other   people   and   they say if you work with it it will give you   an   answer.   Nobody   explains it. There   is always   an   assumption, in every theory, from which you derive the rest of   the theory.  Weber   You're suggesting   that   what   the formative causation,   and   the notion   of the   formal   and   final   causes   would   add   is   explanation, meaningfulness, context   and   philosophical content.  Bohm   And   possibly   some   other   content,   so   you   could   handle   a broader   range   of   questions.  Weber   Can   you give   an   exan1ple?  Bohm   Time, for example. Present   quantum   mechanics   cannot   handle time.   It   can only discuss one moment,   compute   the probability of   that moment, then take   another   moment   and   compute its probability,   and so on.  Weber   All   of   it discrete, whereas   your   proposal would   provide a binding whole in one large context.   To   return to the same question.   is there meaning in the   non-human   world, the world   of   nature,   and   in the universe as a whole?  Bohm   That's   what I'm proposing;   not   only   that   there   is   a meaning to it,   but   rather   that it   is   meaning.   We began by proposing   that   human consciousness   is   its meaning,   not   to   say   that it has   a meaning,   hut it   is  its meaning. According to what it means,   that   is   what it   is.  Weber   What   it means to whom?   To   us?   Or   to some   other   context?  Bohm   Let's think   about   ourselves for a moment. If   we   say something has a meaning, who   is   the person to whom these meanings are being attributed?  Weber   To   the individual,   to   the subgroup, to the culture   ...  Bohm   What   is   the culture   but   a whole set of meanings? If you change the meaning, you have changed the culture. If you change the meaning of   the life to the individual, he   is   different.  Weber   People get   around   this by saying 'Meanings are subjective, they have a place in the   human   world,   but   not in the subatomic world or   in the cosmological world.'

            Meaning   as being   439 Bohm   We have a hidden meaning perhaps   and   we   should explore meaning there too.  Weber   That's   what   you are saying. You're extending meaning to the large, to the small   and   to   the in-between, which   is   the   human   scale. You say   that   meaning   is being.   One   can   see   that   in the psychological world   and   in the social world quite clearly,   but   less so in the physical world.  Bohm   If the electron were determined by a meaning,   that   would be its being. If there   is   a formative cause for the electron, the formative cause   is   what the electron   is. Weber   But one might question the validity   of   the analogy. The fact that   the meaning   of   the   human   being   is   its being you can document, and   you've done it with   many   good   examples, from psychosomatic medicine, for example. But it   is   much   harder   to see in what way the meaning of the electron becomes its being, because the electron doesn't assign its own meaning the way a   human   being does.  Bohm   I   don't   think the   human   being assigns his meaning. I think it happens naturally.  Weber   Is   its being, you're claiming.  Bohm   Yes, it   is   its being.   To   propose   that   we assign meaning pre- supposes   another   being who decides   what   the meanings are going to be for him. I   don't   think   anybody   functions   that   way.   That   is,   he's got his   meanings   from   the   culture, from   the   society,   or   else from   his perceptions,   and   so   on.   He doesn't   choose   his   meanings;   he   is   his nleanings. Weber   It   is   clear in the inner domain.   What   is   not   clear   is,   is   it analogous? Since   live   attribute   meaning   to   the world   of   nature   and   to the electron, does the electron also   attribute   it to itself?   That   would be the analogy carried through.  Bohm   I think the word   'attribute'   is   causing trouble. In a vague sense, of   course, sometimes   we   can consciously   attribute   meaning.   But in general   we   don't   attribute   it; we simply react with meaning, as in the example of someone who perceives a   shadow   as a threatening figure and   whose biochemistry instantly changes.  Weber   So meaning, as you are using it,   is   not   reserved for what   is   self- reflective   and   self-conscious in a   human   sense.  Bohm   For   example, if a person   is   conditioned to look   at   things in a certain way, he doesn't deliberately assign meaning; he immediately  sees it   that   lvay   and   has   no   choice   about   it. He doesn't even know he's doing it.  Weber   You are proposing   that   in the subatomic world, something like   that   also happens.  Bohm   It's primarily unconscious in the subatomic world. If   we   say that   99.99 per cent   of   our   meanings are   not   conscious,   we   don't   choose them, they   just   take place.   That's   the analogy. I would say   that   the degree   of   consciousness   of   the atomic world   is   very low,   at   least of self-consciousness.

            440   Renee Weber Weber   But it's   not   dead   or   inert.   That   is   what you are saying.  Bohn1   It has some degree   of   consciousness in the sense   that   it re- sponds in some way,   but   it has almost   no   self-consciousness.  Weber   Is it possible to state what the meaning of   that   kind of being is?   You started to say   that   time   has something to   do   with it, and coherence   and   development.  Bohm   Yes, the coherence of large systems. The formal   and   final cause determine fundamentally what a thing   is.   They determine how it acts, how it grows, how it sustains itself, where it will end, what it will become,   and   what it gives rise to. Therefore,   that   is   what it   is,   right?  Weber   And you're saying   that   this   is   really embedded within the subatomic   and   cosmological world itself?  Bohm   Yes.   My   proposal is   that   everything   is   of   that   nature. The wave-function resembles information with meaning   and   is   much more than   a   description   of things   as   hard   material   objects.   Its   multi- dimensional character   is   a sign   that   it   cannot   be   put   into ordinary space   but   that   meanings are specifically multi-dimensional. Therefore in this view space   and   time themselves would be some kind of mean- ing. We attribute meaning -   our   minds attribute meaning - in a certain way, even if   not   consciously. But   that   meaning infuses its   intention  and   action   towards the world.   In   so far as there's a consistency be- tween these two, then   that   system has some stability.  Weber   So one philosophical import of this view   is   that   nothing   in the universe,   and   that   includes the domain of nature,   is   neutral   or value free in the positivistic sense.  Bohm   In so far as meaning   is   value,   yes.   There may be all kinds of implicit values, in the way things behave.  Weber   To   simply describe them in the positivistic fashion   is   not to understand them, according to this view.  Bohm   Yes.   That   would be to see them outwardly.  Weber   And mechanically. In   that   case, the inner impulse   that   you are describing, the   telos,   is   then overlooked   and   not understood.  Bohm   Yes. There   is   an   interesting point -   even in mechanics   and physics -   things can always be looked   at   in   both   ways. The laws of Newton, which   we   look   at   as mechanical   and   causal, when put into Lagrangian   form,   take   a   teleological   form   which   is   equivalent   to saying   that   the particle now moves to minimize a certain function called a Lagrangian which   is   integrated over time. It has to do with long periods of time as if it   had   an   end in view to keep its Lagrangian as   small   as   possible.   The   interesting   point   is   that   not   all   of Newton's laws take   that   form.   It's possible to get many equations that   cannot   be   put   in   that   form; all the laws having to   do   with the fundamental particles take   that   form, which suggests   that   that   form has   some importance.   It   has   never been explained   why   that   form should be there.   Most   physicists always start with the   Lagrangian

            Meaning   as   being   441  nowadays; 'we   must   find a Lagrangian.,' it's a sort   of   universal prin- ciple.   But   why there   should   be a Lagrangian.,   nobody   ever says,   or can say.  Weber   What   is   the significance   of   this?  Bohm   It   would be   part   of   a view   that   says   that   the whole principle of   movement is   that   it contains this   end   in view, so   that   it would be quite   natural   to   put   the laws in   that   form. There   are   some laws, when put   in   that   form.,   that   are   indistinguishable from laws   of   a mechanical nature.  Weber   So   that   the   mechanical   laws   can   mask   or   cover   up   these teleological ones.  Bohm   They are a   special case   of   the teleological laws.   It will   not work the   other   way round.  Weber   But   to   you.,   the teleological laws are   primary   and   the mech- anical   laws   may   in fact   be   teleological,   the   universe's   way   of   im- plementing its purpose. Is   that   the idea?  Bohm   Yes,   that   is   what   I   am   proposing.  Weber   So the cosmology you're   proposing   is   meaning,   inherently.  Bohm   Yes.   In   that   sense,   meaning   is   the essence   o.f   reality. Weber   That's   a marvelous thought. If someone were   to   try to pin you   down   and   say   'What   is   the   meaning   of   it:   is   it development, is   it self-awareness   through   time   and   variety,'   what   would you ans- wer?  Bohm   We have   to   discover that. There   is   no   fixed meaning.   That   is its characteristic.,   that   there   is   no   final   meaning.   The   whole point   of meaning   is   that   the   content   is   in a context, which in   turn   is   in a context, and   therefore meaning   is   not   final. We   are   always discovering it,   and that   discovery   of   meaning   is   itself a   part   of   the reality.  Weber   The discovery   of   meaning.,   and   the creation   of   meaning.   Of course   the   question   is:   Do   we   discover   meaning   or   do   we   create meaning?  Bohm   We   can   look   at   it   both   ways. We discover meaning in some sense,   but   whatever we discover we also create some idea as to how we   are going   to   put   it - the way it is going   to   be   abstracted   from the context.  Weber   In   your   earlier   implicate   order   philosophy   you   proposed terms like intelligence,   order   and   compassion when   applied   to   the universe as a whole.   Would   those be a   part   of   the meaning   of   the universe as it unfolds itself?  Bohm   Yes, intelligence   is   part   of   this process   of   the perception   of meaning. In fact when you say 'I   understand'   you really say 'I see the whole meaning   of   this.'  Weber   You say   that   if meaning changes, being changes. Does this mean   that   as we understand., as this   holomovement   understands itself more   deeply   and   more   in detail   through   history, its   being   becomes clearer   or   fuller?

            442   Renee Weber Bohm   Yes.   A change   of   order.   Any change of understanding   is   a change of being,   at   least of the creatures who are doing it   and   of all tha   t they affect.  Weber   Isn't this analogous to Hegel?  Bohm   Yes, I think the point Hegel made was   that   analysis doesn't necessarily mean breaking things into bits,   but   rather   unfolding the meaning.   He   made   the   interesting   point   that   analysis   is   at   the same time synthesis, because when you have unfolded the meaning, the being has changed   and   something has been added to it.   It   unfolds a meaning which   is   another   order   of being.  Weber   That's the synthesis.  Bohm   Yes, the analysis   is   at   the same time a synthesis.  Weber   It also unifies things.  Bohm   There   is   a larger being which includes the analysis   and   the material analyzed. Instead of saying   that   the analysis   is   just   about   the thing analyzed, the analysis   is   a   change   in the thing analyzed.  Weber   So this links change, permanence, development   and   signifi- cance, all in one?  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   You are after all a   quantum   physicist. Is meaning in some way analogous to energy,   or   could it be like the charge   on   matter?  Bohm   No, information   is   a very condensed form of meaning   that has to be unfolded. Information by itself may be irrelevant   or   just wrong,   but   information   is   the form   lvithin,   virtually.   But obviously that   form as the meaning   is   not   complete without the   Â»'hole   meaning and   all   the   contexts   spreading   indefinitely.   So   the   concept   of in- formation   is   very   limited   without   adding   and   bringing   in   the meaning.  Weber   Concepts in particle physics, like spin   or   charm, would be limited   and   you are saying they are true,   but   there   is   more meaning than   that.   What   would be   appropriate   words besides development   or time   that   one could apply to those?  Bohm   I   don't   know. The point   is   that   we   think of these meanings as signasomatic, in the sense   that   the significance affects the soma. The spin, the significance of spin, implies some somatic consequences. The result of observation   is   to change the meaning   and   therefore change the being. There   is   a great analogy between how analysis, which adds further meaning,   is   a change of being,   and   the observation adds some meaning   and   therefore there's a change   of   being.   It   gives a good image of how the observer   and   the observed are one.  Weber   That's   an   example of the claim   that   the observer   and   the observed are one?  Bohm   Yes. The point   about   meaning   is   that   once you bring in the signasomatic side of meaning you can see   that   meaning   is   the observer. Thought   producing meaning   is   the observer,   but   the observer   is   the observed, because   that   meaning   is   inseparable from the somatic   and   it

            Meaning as being   443  unfolds   immediately   into   consequences   which   are   observed,   hence physical.  Weber   It   illustrates in   what   way the observer   is   the observed,   but   it also leaves open   what   being   is   because you are saying   that   being   is  knol1'ing about being. Bohm   Being   and   knowing are inseparable.  Weber   Exactly.  Bohm   Meaning   is   something like the form which informs the energy, so it will actively direct the energy   and   shape it.  Weber   This view assigns a highly active role to   human   beings. Isn't that   the implication   of   what you are saying?  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   Every time meaning changes for us, we've changed what being is   for us.  Bohm   Yes,   and   also   what   it   is   in itself; the whole being   of   whatever being   is,   has changed.   The   question   is:   How   important   is   the change, and   we   don't   know that. But   at   first you might say because it   is   so small it   is   not   a very significant change. But the size   of   the change   is not   always significant.  Weber   A so-called small effect   can   have far-reaching consequences?  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   You used   an   example yesterday   of   size as a   poor   indicator of importance;   people   said,   if   we   just   split   one   or   two   atoms,   that's nothing.  Bohm   Yes, they might have said 'This   can   have very little effect.'  Weber   And they were wrong!  Bohm   I   don't   know if they said it,   but   if they   had   said it,   that   would have been   an   analogy.  Weber   I was going   to   ask you   at   what   level   of   organization meaning comes in,   but   that's   obviously the wrong question, from what we've been saying.  Bohm   Meaning organizes everything.  Weber   If somebody would use meaning as a synonym for cosmic intelligence   or   cosmic mind   or   something like that, how would you respond?  Bohm   Mind   and   matter   are inseparable, in the sense   that   everything is   permeated with meaning.   The   whole idea of the somasignificant   or signasomatic   is   that   at   no   stage are mind   and   matter   ever separated. There are different levels   of   mind. Even the electron   is   informed with a certain level   of   mind.  Weber   It's a beautiful   and   poetic metaphor,   but   specifically in what way can one say   that   the electron   is   somehow infused with mind?  Bohm   In   so far as any meaning determines what it is, how it acts and   so on, it   is   behaving in a way similar to how a mind acts.  Weber   As   a   philosopher   I   can   see   that   this   part   of   your   work, your implicate   order   philosophy, relates to historical philosophy in

            444   Renee Weber  several ways. I think the developmental side   is   reminiscent   of   Hegel, but   the new concepts   of   somasignificance   and   the signasomatic really evoke Spinoza. Like him, you conceive   matter   and   consciousness as two aspects   of   one being.  Bohm   Yes. We haven't penetrated   that   ultimately - the mystery   of   it may go further -   but   as far as I   can   see consciousness contains a self- awareness. This   sort   of process without self-awareness -   it's   hard   to know if you would call it consciousness -   but   you   can   call it a kind   of mind in the sense   that   the   computer   is   almost a kind   of   mind. This would be far more subtle   than   a computer,   but   it would still   not   be self-aware.  Weber   It   would be aware,   but   not   aware   of being aware.  80hm   Yes.  Weber   That   comes in   at   higher levels   of   organization.   One   can see how this works by applying it to a   human   organism; there it's more clear-cut.   For   every state   of   mind there's a state   of   body   and   vice versa, like in Spinoza.  Bohm   It's also very subtle levels   of   being, within the implicate order, which may   not   even be located in the body, in the sense   that   it may be affected,   rather   as Sheldrake   is   suggesting, by fields   which are   not local.  Weber   These   fields   affect   us   and   we   affect   them;   it's   a   mutual interpenetration   and   exchange.  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   Are you proposing something like a   meaning field? Bohm   Yes,   that's   exactly it. You could say   (and   Sheldrake seems to agree   with   this)   that   the   morphogenetic   field   is   a   field   of   active meaning - meaning in the signasomatic   and   somasignificant sense.  Weber   It   may   sound   naive, yet somebody might ask   'How   did it get there?'  Bohm   One   theory   is   that   it accumulates gradually.   In   discussions with   Sheldrake,   for   example,   one   idea   that   has   come   up   is   that meaning   is   constantly operative   at   different levels.   It   works from the implicate to the explicate,   but   there   is   also a projection   out   of the implicate to the explicate   and   an   introjection back into the implicate order. If   we   keep   on   introjecting similar content, it will build up a certain meaning.  Weber   So the meaning field   is   the consequence   both   of   an   inner impulse which somehow it   is,   and   of   what it has undergone in history, and   in   human   consciousness.  Bohm   One   can   see   that   in   human   beings clearly; if   nature   is   similar to us, then   it   should be happening there too.  Weber   That   is   one   of   the beautiful aspects of this world view.   It envisions a   universal coherence   and   points to   an   all-encompassing principle   that   runs   throughout   the system; it doesn't   just   start   at   the human   or   organic level. You are saying   that   it exists   on   all levels.

            Meaning as being   445  Applied   to   the very large scale, what would a cosmologist say, for example,   of   the   constant   making   and   unmaking   of   galaxies   and   stars?  Bohm   We haven't gone   into   it sufficiently   to   see how it would work there.   The   universe   is   supposed   to   have started from this big bang. We might say   that that   is   the formation   of   a certain meaning   and   a certain structure   of   meaning which unfolds. There could be   other   uni- verses, within this sea   of   infinite energy. Let's look   at   basics - meaning, energy,   matter   and, ultimately, self-awareness.   Meaning infuses   and informs energy,   giving it   shape   and   form.   Now   a   certain from   is matter, which   is   energy which has stabilized into a regular form, more or   less stable, with some independence. But there must be a meaning that   is   behind it.   In   terms   of   quantum   mechanics I would say there will have to be some development of the wave function beyond the present theory which   is   just   what   that   is,   i.e.   it would be a formative cause,   a field   of   meaning. Weber   The field   of   meaning would be displayed,   to   use   your   ter- minology, by the explicate   or   the material.  Bohm   Yes,   that   is   the display.  Weber   This   is   the   point   on   which people are going to have to shift in their thinking: it doesn't only have meaning when it comes   out   of  the enfolded order; meaning runs   through   the   implicate order   as well as the explicate order,   at   all levels.  Bohm   Yes.   In   fact you could think   of   the whole series in seeing one level   of   the implicate as the signasomatic consequence   of   the next level, which   is   less subtle, right?  Weber   Y~s.  Bohm   There could be   many   levels,   an   indefinite set   of   levels of im- plication.  Weber   Would   the   signasomatic   principle   function   all   the   way through?  Bohm   Yes, because something is somatic relative to something which is   more subtle.  Weber   So this would function in the   non-human   world, the sub- atomic world, too,   and   would apply   at   all the levels   of   implication, inner   and   outer.  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   It's dazzling   and   one can't help   but   draw   the conclusion   that you are saying: 'This is a universe   that   is   alive (in its   appropriate   way) and   somehow conscious   at   all the levels.' Bohm   Yes, in a way.  Weber   That's   what   I take this   to   mean.  Bohm   We   don't   know how far the self-awareness would go,   but   if you were religious, you would believe it in the sense   of   God,   or   as something   that   would be totally self-aware.  Weber   You mean, as a whole.   The   question   is:   Is there a significance to the holomovement   as a whole?

            446   Renee   Weber Bohm   Yes,   that   is   a question   of   what   proposal   we want to explore. People have, in effect, been exploring notions   of   that   kind in religions. One   view   is   to say   that   the significance   is   similar to   that   of ourselves in a sense   that   Christians would say   that   God   is   a person.  Weber   Or, anyhow, a being.  Bohnl   Well,   they   say   three   persons,   the   Trinity,   which   are   one. Anyway, it's something like a   human   being,   or   rather   the   other   way around;   that   man   is   the image   of   God.   That   implies   that   there   is   a total significance. If you say   Â£~tman,   in Hinduism, something similar is   implied.  Weber   Atman   and   Brahman, seen as identical; the micro-   and   the macrocosm.  Bohm   Yes,   and   Atman   is   from the side   of   meaning. You would say Atman   is   more like the meaning. But then   what   is   meant   would be Brahman, I suppose; the identity   of   consciousness   and   cosmos.  Weber   Looked   at   from   the   so-called   subjective   side   it   would   be Atman;   that   would be the   me~ning.   And   what   is   meant   is   the objec- tive.  Bohm   Meaning   in   this   sense   that   the   somasignificant   and   signa- somatic unite the two sides. This claims   that   the meaning   and   what   is meant   are ultimately one, which   is   the phrase   'Atman   equals   Brahman' of   classical   Hindu   philosophy.  Weber   It's   an   identity-thesis claim.   To   relate this again to what some of the great philosophers   of   the   past   have said: somasignificant   and signasomatic -   aren't   they   your   way   of   working   out   your own creative concepts for   what   Spinoza   meant   by   mind   and   body,   and   what Hegel meant by subject   and   substance?  Bohn1   Yes, this   is   a   way   of   understanding how   these are   related, extending the understanding,   or   extending the meaning.  Weber   It   has plagued philosophers   through   the ages   that   there are these two ways   of   apprehending reality. You are proposing   that   signa  and   somatic   are somehow the very fabric   of   everything in the universe and   that   this gets expressed in   appropriate   ways   at   different levels of organization.  Bohm   Yes,   and   that   the bridge   is   the energy which creates the soma and   regulates it   and   so on.  Weber   Let's pursue this idea of a bridge   of   energy.  Bohm   The energy which   is   informed with meaning.  Weber   Would   it be right to call   that   the efficient cause?  Bohm   Yes, I think   that   is   the nearest to Aristotle's efficient cause. The   soma   is   the material cause.  Weber   And the signa   is   the formal-final cause?  Bohn1   Yes.   The   somasignificance would be the formal-final   cause. The significance   is   both   the form   and   the end.  Weber   So psychosomatic implications,   of   which you gave examples earlier, hold true even   on   the cosmological scale?

            Meaning as being   447  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   Could   one   put   into   words   the   idea   of   a   meaning   or   a   purpose for all this?   You   once   suggested   greater   clarity   of   the universe   about itself.  Bohm   That   could   be   part   of   its end.   Maybe   an   end   of   greater   order, greater   clarity,   an   end   to   create   something.  Weber   So   that   meaning   and   being   become   transparently   clear   to   the organism   at   all the levels   of   itself?  Bohm   That   would   be   part   of   the end. I   don't   know   how   to   put   the end   yet.   The   end   could   be said   to   be love, it   could   be said   to   be order, harmony,   but   the   end   could   also be said   to   be the process itself.  Weber   Spinoza   would   have   liked   that.   He   said   that   the   universe doesn't   have   to   have   a reason,   it   is,   and   that's   enough.   Although   you start   out   from physics,   your   view seems   to   be similar   to   that.  Bohm   Yes, because it's   not   to   say   that   it   has a meaning,   but   it   is   its meaning.   We   are   trying   to   be   more   clear as   to   what   this   meaning   is, because   then   it will   have   changed   our   being.  Weber   You   are   a physicist, yet so   much   of   this   sounds   like   what   a mystic   would   say:   that   in   the   mystical   experience   there   simply   is profound   and   self-evident meaning,   without   utilitarian   overtones.   Isn't that   what   you   are   saying?  Bohm   Yes,   utility   is   only   a   small   part   of   meaning.   Utility   is   a meaning,   but   it's a   rather   restricted meaning.   The   question   is:   Useful for what?   It   always occurs in   some   context   -   without   the   context   we cannot   discuss utility.  Weber   Archibald   MacLeish   defines   poetry   in   that   way.   He   says:   ~A  poem   should   not   mean   but   be.'   So   the   meaning   is its being.   To   shift to   another   question:   are   time,   history   and   development   necessary for the   evolution   of   form   and   consciousness?  Bohln   That   needs   exploration.   Somebody   like   Krishnamurti   and some   other   people like   the   mystics   would   say   that   it has   nothing   to do   with it.   That   is   one   approach.   On   the   other   hand,   we   have   to understand   the   meaning   of   time   more   deeply.   We   have   hardly   touched it so far.  Weher   As a   human   species,   you   mean?  Bohrn   Yes.   We   have   to   see   more   deeply   the   meaning   of   time -   the relation between time   and   the   timeless.   What   is   calle~   eternity   does not   mean   all time,   but   what   is   beyond   time. Is   there   meaning   beyond time?   That   is   one   of   the questions.   Perhaps   the mystic   would   say   that there   is.  J,tTeber   In   fact, the mystic   would   say   that   the   profoundest   sense   of meaning   arises   beyond   time.  Bohm   And   that   meaning   is being   beyond   time.  Weber   That   is the classical mystical position.  Bohn1   But   time is also   meaning   and   the   question   is   ~How   are   the two related?' I   think   that   we have   hardly   begun   to   touch   that.

            448   Renee Weber Weber   Would   you   care   to   make   some tentative   statement   about   how time   is   related   to   meaning   and   being?  Bohn1   In   so far as   meaning   is   telos,   which we will   now   put   in terms of   time, it   may   be   something   deeper   than   that,   beyond   time.  Weber   Of   which this is   just   the outcome.  Bohm   Yes. We   haven't   fully   understood   what   time   is   -   to   see how it emerges from   what   is   beyond   time -   that   is   one   of   the questions   that needs exploration.  Weber   How   would   one   even begin such   an   exploration?  Bohm   For   example,   we   could   consider   orders   that   are   beyond time, from   which   the   time   order   might emerge;   an   implicate   order that   is   beyond   time   that   would be possible   to   have a   sub-order   of time emerging from it.  Weber   It   would   be   beyond   time, yet be the source   of   it in some way?  Bohm   Yes.  Weber   Would   this be the super-implicate   order   or   beyond   that?  Bohn1   It   might be   beyond   that.   There   would have   to   be   an   implicate order   from which time itself emerges.   The   distinction between the signifi- cance   and   its   somatic   consequences   is   one   which we   make   in   thought only.   They   merge   and   flow   into   each   other.   But   time itself arises   out of   that   sort   of   distinction because we say there's   meaning   and   the   end -   in so far as the   end   is   not   yet realized -   is   time. If the   end   were immediately realized, we   would   not   have time.  Weber   Time   is   like the expression   of   the   gap   between this being   and its becoming,   that   being.  Bohm   Yes.   If   we   say   that   there   are   enfolded   in   being   potential ends   which   are   not   yet realized,   that   begins   to   provide the   ground   for time.  Weber   If we   look   at   it cosmologically   and   philosophically, it brings up   the question, 'Is there   something   incomplete   or   unrealized in this whole cosmos   that   would bring   about   this   gap   between   what   being   is and   what   its becoming will be - a necessary enfoldment   of   itT  Bohm   In   so far as   meaning   is   incomplete it inevitably implies time. The   mystic might say   that   perhaps   the   total   is   complete   and   does   not involve time,   but   that   there is   another   set   of   meanings which   is   not complete which   does   involve time.   Here   it becomes a   question   of value. The   mystic might place the highest   and   supreme   value   on   the   one that   does   not   involve time   and   may   tend   to   give   much   smaller value to   the   one   that   does.   On   the   other   hand,   we   must   explore   that   to   see if the mystic   is   always right.  Weber   All   the   more   so   because   your   whole   philosophy   seems   to grant   genuine   status   to   the world   of   history   and   changing development as   part   of   the   meaning   of   the whole thing.  Bohn1   Yes. See, there   is   a   kind   of   meaning   that   is   incomplete,   and the question   is   what   is   its value?   That's   our   first question.   The   mystic may   be   undervaluing   that.

            Meaning as being   449 Weber   Filtering it   out   as if it were   an   accident   of   the universe.  Bohm   At least, a great   many   mystics may   do   that.   On   the   other hand, in the Christian tradition,   and   the Jewish one probably, time and   history have a very great significance.  Weber   Your   implicate   order   philosophy says   that   genuine understand- ing   of   the holomovement requires one to look   at   both   the temporal and   what   is   beyond time, together. You are suggesting a synthesis, a holist   approach   to this question.  Bohm   Yes. If   we   were   to   take this view   of   Hegel's   about   analysis, that   analysis   is   the   enfoldment   of   what   is   to be analyzed,   and   that   at the same time   is   a synthesis. It enriches the thing, it   adds   to the thing that   is   being analyzed.   It   adds meaning   and   therefore adds being.  Weber   So concerning the question raised earlier,   'Do   we   discover   or do   we   create meaning?' it   is   as if in discovering it   we   create it   or create it   in   us. Bohm   Not   only that,   but   we   enrich it;   we   create something which has   not   been there.  Weber   We   add   to it.  Bohm   Yes. We are a   part   of   it   and   it   is   part   of   us.  Weber   Since any meaning   that   we   grasp in it changes its being, this makes us   partners   in the evolution of the universe?  Bohm   Yes, that's the proposal. Therefore if   we   take   that   complete universe   of   the mystics   and   let it unfold in time, then   that   unfoldment is   similar to analysis.   It   unfolds what   is   implicit.   As   Nicholas   of   Cusa said, eternity   both   enfolds   and   unfolds time. We may   add   that   un- foldment enriches what was enfolded.   It   adds meaning to it   and   there- fore being.  Weber   Since the point   of   departure   of   your   whole philosophy   is   not crude   materialism   to   begin   with,   being   transcends   the   visible,   the tactile   and   all that.  Bohm   Yes,   and   space   and   time.   In   fact the visible   and   the tactile are the outcome of meaning, in this generalized sense.  Weber   They are derivative,   and   the generative orders are these in- visible realities.  Bohm   Yes,   at   least in some sense; if   we   see the meaning   of   something, that   thing has in some way been changed. But the question   is:   How significant   is   the change?   That   is   something   that   needs to be explored. You say   that   is   a small change, probably,   but   it may   not   be so small in its full implications.  Weber   You are proposing   that   its magnitude   is   overlooked.  Bohm   Magnitude   may   not   be the significance.  Weber   I   don't   mean   quantity-wise,   but   its significance.  Bohm   Its   significance   is   overlooked.   Teilhard   de   Chardin   has proposed something like this; when you study science it gives   an   ac- count   and   explains everything except the   human   being in his essence. One   view   of   it   is   to say that's   not   a very   important   oversight.   Or   else

            450   Renee Weber  one may say, gradually we'll take care   of   it. But the   other   view   is   to say   that   though   it looks small, it may be   that   it reveals what   is   much more significant.  Weber   Is there   an   analogy in the world of physics?  Bohm   Just what I said earlier,   i.e.   those small   atoms   disintegrating, revealing something much more significant.  Weber   What   does all this imply for the   human   world? Looking   at the universe in this way changes   our   lives in what way?  Bohm   It's   hard   to   say   at   first,   but   it will clearly imply something very different, a different attitude in the sense   that   we   won't give   that much primary weight   to   the external   and   the mechanistic side -   the side   of   fragmentation   and   partiality. Also, it encourages us much more toward   a creative attitude,   and   fundamentally it opens the way to the transformation   of   the   human   being because a change   of   meaning   is   a change   of   being.   At   present   we   say   because   of   the confused   frag- mentary   meanings   we   have   a   confused   fragmentary   being,   both individually   and   socially. Therefore this opens the way to a whole being, in society   and   in the individual.  Weber   It   also   seems   to   bring   in ethical   responsibility,   because   if we   are,   or   can be   partners   in, helping to transform being through   our meanings, wouldn't   that   imply   that   what   we   think   and   feel   counts? Bohm   It   counts.   When   you say responsibility, the key word   is   re- sponse.   Nobody   can   be responsible who   is   unable to respond. If you ask somebody who   is   unable to respond to be responsible, you have not   responsibility,   but   probably   guilt.   As   long   as   the   meaning   is confused,   nobody   can   respond to all this. His response   is   going   to   be very limited   and   therefore   that   responsibility   is   very limited.  Weber   To   relate it   to   human   psychology   and   transformation, the key seems   to   be the Socratic maxim   'Know   yourself,' go inward,   and also 'Observe.'  Bohm   And also outward.   The   outward   and   the inward are one   part of one total meaning.  Weber   You are really saying   our being   is   meaning.   The   whole world  is   meaning.  Bohm   Yes. The being of   matter   is   its meaning; the being of ourselves is   meaning; the being of society   is   its meaning.   The   mechanistic view has created a   rather   crude   and   gross meaning which has created a crude   and   gross   and   confused society.  Weber   This view,   your   view, would make   human   beings   feel   rooted and   have their dynamic place in the whole scheme   of   things.  Bohm   At least they would have a chance to find it there. It's a view within which it makes sense to observe to find   out   where your place IS.  Weber   Beautiful!

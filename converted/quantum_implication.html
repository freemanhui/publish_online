        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">In my first attempt to do this I considered a quantum mechanical</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">pursue this idea further at the time. What happened was that I had</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">meanwhile sent copies of my book to Einstein, to Bohr, to Pauli and</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">to a few other physicists. I received no reply from Bohr, but got an</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">enthusiastic response from Pauli. Then I received a telephone call from</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">Einstein, saying that he wanted to discuss the book with me. When</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">we met, he said that I had explained Bohr's point of view as well as</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">could probably be done, but that he was still not convinced. What</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">came out was that he felt that the theory was incomplete, not in the</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">sense that it failed to be the final truth about the universe as a whole,</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">but rather in the sense that a watch is incomplete if an essential part</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">is missing. This was, of course, close to my more intuitive sense that</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">the theory was dealing only with statistical arrays of sub-processes</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">associated with similar observational events. Einstein felt that the</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">supplying the missing elements we could in principle get beyond</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">Shortly afterwards, I began to reflect on the hologram and to see</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">metaphors. Through these metaphors the poet evokes rather than</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">prescribes an understanding of what a poem is. Consider one of</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">MacLeish's figures: 'A poem should be wordless as the flight of birds.'</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="text-line indent3">The metaphor is conventional in that it is composed of two terms -</blockquote>

His challenge to the conventional understanding of quantum theory has led scientists to reexamine what it is they are doing and to question the nature of their theories and their scientific methodology. Quantum Implications is a collection of original contributions by many of the world's leading scholars and is dedicated to David Bohm, his work and the issues raised by his ideas. It is a tribute to his creative imagination, his single mindedness, his inspirational guidance, and his complete dedication to the further understanding of the fundamental issues in physics, philosophy and the general intellectual well-being of mankind.

There appears to be no physics. whatsoever in the family background. Bohm, himself, became interested in science at an early age, being urged on by a fascination of. finding out how things worked. By the age of eight he had already. been introduced to science fiction. This fired his imagination and generated in him a deep interest in real science. But it was the nature of the real world that fascinated him most. He recalls the profound effect that a book on astronomy had on him in those formative years. He was struck by the vast order and regularity of the universe. This impressed him so much that he began to devote a great deal of time to science. ",

Being a successful businessman, he could not imagine how anyone could make a living out of 'scientism' as he insisted on calling it. Young David took this as a challenge and using his earlier interest in redesigning mechanical devices he decided to try to make money out of inventing. He was rather proud of one invention in par-. ticular: namely, a 'dropless pitcher'. (This ingenious item had nothing at all to do with that great American sporting pastime, baseball. It. was a jug or teapot that did not drip!) His principal concern now became how to make this design pay. After almost giving up in despair, he came across an advertisement in a popular science magazine offering, for the sum of \\$5, advice on how to exploit financially a good invention. Off went the \\$5 and back came some advice on how to obtain a patent. But that, of course, would cost a few hundred dollars! Would it be worth it? The answer (apparently, included in the \\$5!) was to do a door-to-door survey to test market demand! It was at this point in his life that he determined that he would become a theoretical physicist.

Furthermore, as Bohm saw it, these deeper structures seemed to possess properties which did not reflect the way physicists were talking. about the behaviour of matter. In quantum mechanics, for example, it. seemed that this interconnectedness was vital, yet the usual presentation of the subject seemed to minimise this aspect of the phenomena. ",

But the conceptual structure of this theory was very different from that of the classical theory. It implied a radical change in our outlook on reality. But precisely what were the nature of these changes did not yet seem very clear. The majority view was (and still is) that the precise nature of the conceptual changes are not important.

For example it contains sections on the approach to the classical limit, the measurement prob-. lem and the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen (EPR) paradox. The latter was. of particular importance since it reformulated the EPR example in terms of correlated spin one-half systems. This discussion not only clarified the essential issues raised in the debate but also led to the suggestion of using positronium decay and optical cascades in actual experiments designed specifically to explore the consequences of EPR situations. These experiments have been significant in moving the continuing debate from what was generally regarded as a realm of. speculative philosophy, or even theology, into hard physics. ",

He developed the line started by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen38 in their well-known paper where they criticised the completeness of quantum mechanics. Schrodinger showed that there was what he called an. 'entanglement relation' appearing in the quantum formalism. By this he meant that the states of the subsystems cannot be separated from. each other and this implied that, for a certain class of systems, the results of a measurement of a subsystem A, spatially well-separated from its companion B, depends not only on the results obtained at B but on what one decided to measure at B. It is this last phrase that contradicts our usual notion of locality. W/hat is done to B should not influence the result of a measurement of A, especially when they are. spatially separated and are not connected through a classical potential. Thus the usual formulation of quantum mechanics showed, in the hands of Schrodinger, that some notion of non-locality is involved. As Dirac puts it, 'For an assembly of particles we can set up field. quantities which do change in a local way, but when we interpret them in terms of probabilities of particles we get again something which is non-local'39 However, because the usual approach cannot discuss the individual actual process, the question of locality becomes rather fuzzy and these questions can be conveniently ignored.

Some authors have noticed that one can escape from. violating the Bell inequalities in quantum mechanics by allowing negative probabilities.46 It has generally been regarded that such a notion is meaningless and amounts to replacing one difficulty by another. But it is well known that negative probabilities arise elsewhere when one tries to obtain quantum mechanical averages using phase-space distributions, so the question of negative probabilities is not restricted to the question of non-locality. Richard Feynman has thought a great deal about these problems and, indeed, has admitted to having difficulty in trying to understand the world view that quantum mechanics represents. He has always tried to narrow the problem down to particular features and explore them in depth to try to learn something new. In this volume he re-examines the notion of negative probabilities and explores its possibilities.47 ",

The difference in the response in the retina as the eye crosses the line enables the brain to reconstruct the line.

There is a continual drive to find models in which all aspects of the process can be 'displayed' simultaneously. In the new view it is necessary to distinguish between that which could be unfolded together (the explicate order) and that which remains enfolded (the implicate order). Surely this is the deeper truth that essentially lay. behind Bohr's notion of complementarity, although it tended to. become trivialised into wave-particle duality. ",

This is in no sense a plea to introduce ideas of 'vitalism'; rather new concepts of order will be required, a theme that has a close relationship with Bohm's own thinking. With Bohm, new orders are required within physics. These new orders incorporate 'wholeness' and here a more organic view of nature is required. Rosen suggests that the study of the behaviour of macromolecules may provide a. clue as to the nature of these orders. He uses the van der Waals gas to illustrate what he has in mind and shows how this can be reanalysed in the old Aristotelian categories of causation. This leads. him to suggest a novel idea that each category of causation is reflected in a logically independent aspect of system description, thus implying that it is no longer possible to think of a description purely in terms of states plus dynamical laws.

For example, when the wave passes through a pair of slits, the resulting interference. pattern produces a complicated quantum potential that could affect the particles far from the slits in such a way as to 'bunch' them into a set of fringes equivalent to those predicted in the usual interpenetration of the quantum theory.

Such a behaviour is in contrast to that shown in classical physics, for which the interaction between the parts is a predetermined function, independent of the state of the whole. Thus, classically, the whole is merely the result of the parts and their preassigned interactions, so that the primary reality is the set of parts while the behaviour of the whole is derived entirely from those parts and their interactions. With the quantum potential, however, the whole has an independent and prior significance such that, indeed, the whole may be said to organize the activities of the parts. For example, in a superconducting state it may be seen that electrons are not scattered because, through the action of the quantum potential, the whole system is undergoing a co-ordinated movement more like a ballet dance than like a crowd of unorganized people.

In this paper I compared and contrasted. relativistic and quantum notions of order, leading to the conclusion. that they contradicted each other and that new notions of order were needed. ",

This immediately struck me as very relevant to the question of order, since, when the ink drop was spread out, it still had a hidden' (i.e. non-manifest) order that was revealed when it was reconstituted. On the other hand, in our usual language, we would say that the ink was in a state of 'disorder' when it was diffused through the glycerine. This led me to see that new notions of order must be involved here. ",

So the thought occurred to me: perhaps the movement of enfoldment and unfoldment is universal, while the extended and separate forms that we commonly see in experience are relatively stable and independent patterns, maintained by a constant underlying movement of enfoldment and unfoldment. This latter I called the holomovement. The proposal was thus a reversal of the usual idea. Instead of supposing that extended matter and its movement are fundamental, while enfoldment and unfoldment are explained as as particular case of this, we are saying that the implicate order will have to contain within itself all possible features of the explicate order as potentialities, along with the principles determining which of these features shall become actual. The explicate order will in this way flow out of the implicate order through unfoldment, while in turn it 'flows back' through further enfoldment. The implicate order thus plays a primary role, while the explicate order is secondary, in the sense that its main qualities and properties are ultimately derived in its relationship with the implicate order, of which it is indeed a special and distinguished case.

The way in which the separate and extended form enfolds the whole is, however, not merely superficial or of secondary significance, but rather it is essential to what that form is and to how it acts, moves and behaves quite generally.

What is missing in these analogies is an inner principle of organization in the implicate order that determines which sub-wholes shall become actual and what will be their relatively independent and stable forms.

So 1 wondered if these two rather different approaches were not related in some deep sense - especially because I had come at least to the essence of both notions at almost the same time. At first sight, the causal interpretation seemed to be a step backwards toward mechanism, since it introduced the notion of a particle acted on by a potential. Nevertheless, as I have already pointed out, its implication that the whole both determines its sub-wholes and organizes their activity clearly goes far beyond what appeared to be the original mechanical point of departure.

And, in fact, as in the case in the particle theory, the wave function will under normal conditions tend to factorize at the large-scale level in an entirely objective way that is not basically dependent on our knowledge or on our observations and measurements. So now we see quite generally that the whole universe not only determines and organizes its sub-wholes, but also that it gives form to what has until now been called the elementary particles out of which everything is supposed to be constituted. What we have here is a kind of universal process of constant creation and annihilation, determined through the superquantum potential so as to give rise to a world of form and structure in which all manifest features are only relatively constant, recurrent and stable aspects of this whole..

The name plasma' for such a gas was coined by the late Irving Langmuir in the course of his theoretical and experimental investigations of gas discharges at General Electric Research Laboratories during the 1920s. In a gaseous discharge, such as one finds in a fluorescent light, only a minute fraction of the atoms present are ionized, that is disassociated into positive ions and electrons; none the less a study of the motion of. the ions and electrons shows that many new and interesting phenomena can take place. In most highly-ionized gases, such as one finds in. the ionosphere (the layer of free ions and electrons present toward the top of our atmosphere), the motion of the electrons and ions is, in fact, organized to a remarkable extent. The organization takes two forms, neither of which is characteristic of ordinary dilute gases made up of neutral atoms. First, a given particle, ion or electron, does not move independently of its neighbors. Rather, such a particle is always. accompanied by a cloud of other particles, which move along with it in such a way as to screen out the electric field produced by its charge.. Second, the electrons carry out long-wavelength, high-frequency. oscillations, which involve the coherent motion of many thousands of particles. Langmuir's studies of the possibilities for organized behavior in such a system led him to believe that here was a new state of matter - neither solid, liquid or gas. He called it plasma.. ",

During the war the size of that group increased somewhat; one of the methods of obtaining separated isotopes of uranium, the so-called calutron, invented at the University of California at Berkeley, involved the use of highly ionized arc sources, i.e. plasmas. Also toward the end of the war, and in the years immediately following it, physicists began to be interested in plasmas as possible devices for the production and amplification of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region. Thus in 1950, at the time I received my PhD degree from Princeton University under David Bohm for a thesis entitled \\*The role of plasma oscillations in electron interactions,' there were likely no more than a hundred physicists in this country and abroad who were, in one sense or another, working on plasmas. Some were electrical engineers, working on electron vacuum tubes; some were still concerned with gaseous discharges. Others were astrophysicists, interested not so much in the ionosphere as in the plasma of charged particles which surround the sun, or that very dilute plasma which makes up all of inter-planetary and intergalactic space. Bohm and I were interested in plasmas for yet another reason -- as offering a clue to a fundamental understanding of the behavior of electrons in metals. ",

The model is realistic for experimental situations in which the neutral atoms and impurity ions, present in all laboratory plasmas, play a negligible role. The second model is still simpler; in it the discrete nature of the positive ions is neglected altogether. The plasma is thus regarded as a collection of electrons moving in a background of uniform positive charge. Such a model can obviously only teach us about. electronic behavior in plasmas. It may be expected to account for experiments conducted under circumstances such that the electrons do not distinguish between the model, in which they interact with the uniform charge, and the actual plasma, in which they interact with positive ions.

The electrons. then experience a strong mutual repulsion, due to their Coulomb interaction. Their reaction will be a violent one.

The cage then becomes a trap, pulling electrons back in to establish charge neutrality. In fact, too many will come in once more, then go out, back in, etc., corresponding to an oscillation in the density of electrons about the equilibrium position of charge neutrality. In this fashion a plasma oscillation is born. The oscillation is a longitudinal oscillation. since the electron density changes in the direction of motion of the. wave.

Such would no longer be the case when we increase the resolving power of our microscope and study what is going on at distances comparable to or slightly larger than the average spacing between the electrons. For such distances the screening action of the plasma is no longer perfect; strong electric fields can and do exist. Further, the organized oscillations are no longer possible, and one merely observes the random effects expected from a gas of individual particles.

What, however, makes the plasma a particularly interesting object of study is its schizophrenic behavior; depending on the stimulus, it will display either collective or individual particle behavior of the kind we have discussed. One such stimulus is a probe which transfers momentum and energy to the system in a measurable way. In principle we could think of accomplishing the momentum transfer by striking the plasma with a hammer. In practice we might use a charged particle as our probe. We then ask what is the transfer of energy which goes with a given momentum transfer. If we had only a gas of free, non-interacting electrons, the energy transfer would be proportional to the momentum transfer and to the velocity of the. electron which received the impact. For a low-momentum probe, therefore, the energy transfer is correspondingly low. The interaction between the electrons alters the situation markedly. The energy transfer in the plasma will be proportional to the frequency of the plasma oscillation and very nearly independent of the momentum, for a small transfer of momentum. The energy transfer is much larger than that obtaining in a gas of non-interacting electrons. We see that the characteristic excitation energy is increased by the Coulomb interactions. Because many electrons are coupled together by the long range of this interaction, as a group they can take up much more energy than would be possible if they acted as individual, uncoupled particles. If, now, we continue to increase the momentum transfer associated with our. probe, we eventually reach a point at which this is no longer the case. The momentum transfer to an individual particle yields an energy transfer which becomes comparable with that produced by the collective motion induced by the Coulomb interaction. We have arrived. at the region for a transition from collective to individual particle behavior; in such a transition region the system will display a mixture of individual particle and collective behavior which will in general be quite difficult to describe in detail. When we consider a yet higher momentum transfer, we find that the behavior is simple once more, for now the system displays only individual particle behavior, and the effects associated with the interaction between the electrons become unimportant.

As we mentioned earlier, the plasma serves as a useful prototype for the other many-body problems, notably for the motion of electrons in solids. This possibility was first recognized by David Bohm at Princeton University in the late 1940s. Bohm had worked on gaseous discharges during the war at the University of California Radiation Laboratory, and came to the conclusion that the plasma offered real possibilities for an improved understanding of the theory of metals. His belief was based on the fact that in a metal, as in a plasma, one dealt with a high density of nearly-free electrons moving in the field of positive ions. One might accordingly hope to describe the metal as a plasma of very high density by replacing the positive ions by a uniform distribution of positive charge. There were two apparent obstacles to the development of a theory of metals based on the plasma. The first was that the density of electrons in a metal is some ten billion times larger than that found in gas discharges. As a result the electrons can no longer be described by the laws of classical mechanics, but must be treated by a theory based on quantum mechanics. We call such a plasma a quantum plasma. Second, the ions in a gas discharge are free to move, while those in a metal oscillate about fixed positions in a lattice. Their equilibrium positions form a periodic array which defines the crystal structure of the lattice. As a result it is no longer clear whether the model in which the influence of the positive ions is replaced by a uniform positive charge will be a realistic model for metallic behavior. Such a simplified model will certainly miss the important role that the periodicity of the ions has upon the electron motion. The question is whether such an omission would prove disastrous to the physical predictions of the theory. ",

In this model primary attention was paid to the motion of a single electron in the periodic field of the ions. The many-body character of the problem was allowed for only in a simple, statistical sense. Thus each electron was assumed to move quite independently of all the other electrons, and explicit correlations in the positions of the electrons brought about by the Coulomb interaction were completely ignored. The one-electron model was chosen, then, to emphasize the role played by the periodic potential of the ions in determining the electron motion.

That it did not do so was scarcely surprising, since the neglect of correlations in the particle positions meant that the electrons, in this description, would have an appreciable chance of being close together. Such close encounters, in turn, added a large positive energy arising from the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons. The energy so added was sufficiently large that most metals, in this approximation, would not be stable, but would disintegrate into individual atoms.

The approach in which wave field coordinates were introduced explicitly was in many ways the more powerful one, in that we could specify quite easily the transition from collective to individual-particle behavior, and determine explicitly the resulting interaction between the particles once the part of the Coulomb interaction responsible for the collective modes had been taken into account. It possessed the further advantage that the collective modes (the plasma oscillations) and the individual electrons were treated on an equal footing; it possessed the disadvantage that it appeared that we had over-described the system by introducing too many degrees of freedom.

Our inability to come up with a simple mathematical proof that these subsidiary conditions could, in fact, be satisfied (put another way,. would not cause any difficulties and could safely be ignored) delayed our publication of this formulation by some three years. It caused us to devise several other approaches to the problem (such as a method of self-consistent fields for calculating plasma oscillations which 1 included in my thesis) before we had sufficient confidence in our physical intuition to write up our results for publication as the third in our series of papers dealing with the description of electron interaction.

Indeed, this was just what was required to put the 'one-electron' model of metals on a more satisfactory footing. Because of the short range of the effective particle interaction, the mathematical divergences which had haunted previous attempts at constructing a consistent treatment of an electron interaction were no longer present. It was therefore possible to apply perturbation theory to compute the way the interaction between the electrons altered the ground-state energy of the system.

It is sug-. gested that it is similar to the relationship between maps of different. types and that, while theories at different levels need not be derivable from one another, they must at least be mutually consistent in their predictions. The relationship between quantum mechanics, in its. standard interpretation, and classical physics fails this test. Existing attempts to resolve the measurement paradox are briefly reviewed, and it is suggested that one avenue has been insufficiently explored; namely, the possibility that the complexity of a physical system may itself be a relevant variable which may introduce new physical principles.

Actually, an even more spectacular experiment has been carried out in real life recently using. a neutron interferometer.2 In this experiment a beam of spin-polarized neutrons was split into two beams, well separated from one another in space; the spins of the neutrons in one beam were flipped and the beams then allowed to recombine. By blocking off one beam at a time it was possible to examine the properties of the other at the point of recombination, and in this way it was explicitly established that the spin properties of the complete ensemble (the recombined beams) were quite different from those of the mixture of the two sub-ensembles (the separated beams). Since the average flux of neutrons was low enough that the probability of two being close enough to affect one another's dynamics was totally negligible, this experiment provides rather spectacular confirmation of the conclusion that one should not think of the neutron as 'being in' one or other beam until it has actually been measured to be so.

This picture is no doubt paradoxical (in the original meaning of the term, 'against expectation') and might lead us to guess that we will some day obtain a more intuitively pleasing description, but in itself it is not obviously internally inconsistent, nor does it lead in any obvious way to any discrepancy with our everyday view of the macroscopic world provided that we are prepared to accept the notion of 'measurement' as given from outside the theory. Indeed, Bohr,' and with greater sophistication Reichenbach,' were able to develop an interpretation of the quantum-mechanical formalism which is consistent within its self-imposed limits precisely by postulating a radically different ontological status for microscopic entities such as electrons or neutrons and the macroscopic apparatus which performs the measurement. In the words of a famous quotation from Bohr: 'Atomic systems should not even be thought of as possessing definite properties in the absence of a specific experimental set-up designed to measure these properties' On the other hand, Bohr also maintains that in order to secure unambiguous communication of our results, we must describe the macroscopic apparatus and its behavior in the language of classical physics (in which, of course, the apparatus must possess definite properties). Thus, it is the act of measurement that is the bridge between the microworld, which does not by itself possess definite properties,. and the macroworld, which does. Indeed, according to most textbooks it is the act of measurement which causes the 'collapse of the wave function' from a linear superposition into an eigenstate of the measured quantity. Thus, the concept of measurement is, prima facie at least, absolutely central to the interpretation of the quantummechanical formalism. ",

The problem is that quantum mechanics. absolutely forbids a measurement to take place, if by a 'measurement' is meant a process which has the features ascribed to it in the standard textbook account. This statement needs some amplification. The point. is that, if we believe (as most physicists at least implicitly seem to) that quantum mechanics is a universal theory, then it applies not only to single atoms and molecules but to arbitrarily large and complex collections of them, and in particular to the special collections which we have chosen to use as measuring devices (photographic plates,. Geiger counters, etc.). So, although it is not obviously necessary to. describe these objects, and their interaction with the microsystems whose properties are to be measured, in explicitly quantum-mech-. anical terms, it is at any rate legitimate to do so. Let us then initially (for the sake of simplicity of exposition only) assume that the measuring device starts in an initial state which is represented by a quantum mechanical wave function. $\\Psi_{0}$ . As before, we suppose that the property of the microscopic system which is to be measured is represented by a quantum-mechanical operator $\\hat{\\pmb A}$ with eigenfunctions. $\\varphi_{i}$ and eigenvalues $a_{i}$ .Suppose, first, that a particular microsystem entering the apparatus is drawn from an ensemble whose quantum. state is represented by the wave function. $\\varphi_{i}.$ Then, if we are to be able to read off the value of. $a_{i}$ from the behavior of the macroscopic measuring device, the interaction between the microsystem and the device must induce the latter to make a transition into a different state, with a wave function we shall label $\\Psi_{i}.$ (It is possible that one (but no more than one) of the. $\\Psi_{i}$ is identical to $\\Psi_{0}$ in which case we. speak of a \\*negative-result' measurement. This feature in no way affects the general argument.) Moreover, the different states $\\Psi_{i}$ must be not only mutually orthogonal but also distinguishable by purely macroscopic measurements (e.g. inspection with the naked eye). (A discussion (considerably more sophisticated than the above one, cf. below) of how some common measuring devices fulfil this condition is given in reference 5.)

Secondly, the case where the state of the microsystem is unchanged by its interaction with the measuring device (ideal' measurement) is the exception rather than the rule, and the description of the final state may have to be modified to allow for this. Thirdly, the measuring device is in practice itself an open system which interacts with outside influences such as the vacuum electromagnetic field, and the \\*universe' which is described by the superposition [3] (or the appropriate density-matrix generalization) contains many other such degrees of freedom.

This no doubt sounds not only unoriginal but naive; and indeed, so long as we take the concept of a 'map' as equivalent to that of a 'picture, it is a view which has deservedly and repeatedly been shot through with holes by successive generations of philosophers. But let us for a moment experiment with the idea of taking the notion of a 'map,' as such, deadly seriously. In that case it is obvious after a moment's thought that a map is certainly not equivalent to a picture. What kinds of maps do we know? There are Ordnance Survey (or USGs) maps; there are the road maps put out by the motoring organizations; there are maps prepared for military use; there are demographic maps, maps of the city subway system; and so on. What do they have in common? In the first place, a negative feature; a map is not a picture of anything. (On looking down from a low-flying plane, one does not see contour lines twisting around the hillsides, nor does the red or brown with which Ordnance Survey maps mark the roads designated as A- or B-class by the UK Ministry of Transport bear any relation to the actual color of the road.) Indeed, while many maps (e.g. Ordnance Survey or military maps) do bear a metric or at least a topological correspondence to the objects they describe, even this feature is not essential; the maps of the London Underground (subway) system displayed in the stations are certainly not metrically accurate, and (as far as I remember) maps of Charles de Gaulle airport do not show the complicated topology of the connecting tubes in detail. Why do we, nevertheless, regard these as adequate and useful maps? Quite simply, because they fulfil the basic function of a map,. which is to convey, in the form of a visual gestalt, an amount of information adequate to permit us to plan whatever activity we had in mind (the ascent of a mountain, a car journey to Scotland, an airport security operation, or whatever it was). Since different kinds of maps have different functions, it is not surprising that they have little in common, except for being two-dimensional displays (though in future we may no doubt get used to holographic maps). Mountaineers do not usually complain because their map fails to show the names of roads, nor do London subway travellers complain that, if you believe the wall maps, all subway lines travel in one of only eight directions, both maps are perfectly adequate for the particular purpose for which they are intended. It would be totally ridiculous to complain that a map of one kind is somehow inadequate because it is not in one-toone correspondence with a map of a quite different kind.

I believe that this type of relationship between theories at different 'levels' (to use a rather question-begging word) is much more. common in science generally, and even in physics, than one would think if one reads either most physics textbooks or most philosophers of science. For example, most textbooks of solid-state physics give the impression' that the whole goal of the subject is to solve Schrodinger's equation for a collection of, say, $10^{23}$ nuclei and associated electrons, and that any models which we may build at an intermediate or macroscopic level (for example, the Drude model of electrons in metals, the Debye model of an elastic continuum, the Landau-Fermi liquid theory, and so on) are rather regrettable props which are in essence attempts to cover up our inability to do this by giving approximately valid solutions to the problem. Popular as this way of thinking may be among solid-state physicists, I believe that it is totally mistaken. In the first place, even if we could solve the appropriate Schrodinger's equation for an arbitrary, specified set of boundary conditions, we should never be able to apply the solution since we should in practice never be able to determine these boundary conditions with sufficient accuracy. Secondly, and far more importantly, what would be the value in having a complete and exact solution anyway? We should be rather in the position of the ancient Babylonians, who had (or so it is said) an elaborate system of recipes which enabled them to predict astronomical phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, but without any unifying principle or anything which we could call a model. Such a solution would by itself in no way help us to predict qualitatively new phenomena, for it would not identify for us the. qualitatively important features of the physical situation. That is. precisely what the intermediate-level models of condensed-state. physics are all about; they are attempts (and, to the extent that they survive, successful attempts) to grasp the relevant features of the physics and to present them in the form of a mental gestalt.

Clearly it does. At the very least, we need the constraint of consistency, that is, it should not be possible to derive results from one description which are clearly in contradiction to those derived from the other. It is, actually, an implicit recognition of this requirement which is responsible for much of the current output of theoretical work in condensed-matter physics, though with the ironical aspect that most of the authors of this work are under the impression that they are doing something quite different. Take, for example, the case of a clearly macroscopic law of physics such as Ohm's law. There must be literally hundreds of papers in the literature which aim (or claim to aim) to 'derive' Ohm's law from microscopic considerations. Yet, if the word 'derivation' is taken literally (in the sense, say, in which it would be understood by a pure mathematician) they all fail utterly. They can claim success, to one degree or another, only if by 'derivation' is meant a procedure which is familiar to all working physicists but, oddly enough, little studied by philosophers of science, in which what one actually does is to show that there exists a series of not implausible auxiliary assumptions which, when added to the microscopic description, will make it explicitly compatible with the required macroscopic result. (In the case of a 'derivation' of Ohm's law, such assumptions might for example relate to the cancellation of off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, to the irrelevance of the exact shape of the sample, and so on.) In other words, what this kind of work is really seeking to demonstrate is not derivability but compatibility of the models used at the microscopic and macroscopic (or intermediate) levels. Indeed, it is to my mind no accident that some o1 the most important theorems in the history of physics have actually been incompatibility theorems, e.g. the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem on the inexplicability of atomic diamagnetism within the framework of classical statistical mechanics, or the famous theorem of Bell on the incompatibility of the predictions of so-called local hidden-variable theories with those of quantum mechanics.

To put it crudely, in appropriate circumstances quantum mechanics not only fails to assert that macroscopic events (clicking of a counter, etc.) occur, but positively asserts that they don't occur; whereas our ordinary everyday language, which we naturally think of as embodying our direct experience, asserts with equal firmness that they do. It is as if we had two maps of quite different type but both guaranteed by their makers to represent topological features accurately, in one of which a certain road crosses a certain river while in the other the two never get close together. In that case we would certainly say that one of the two maps must be a bad one. Yet already there is a difficulty with the analogy. In the case of the maps, we could prove that one map (at least) was a bad one, because under suitable circumstances it would lead us demonstrably. to mis-plan our route; that is, its badness would have practical consequences.

In the category which in effect refuses to do so, the best-known 'solution' is probably the Copenhagen interpretation as formulated by Bohr, and, with some differences, Heisenberg; this in effect lays down by fiat that the macroscopic world, including our preparation devices, measuring instruments, etc., must be described in classical terms, on the grounds that otherwise we should have no possibility of communicating with one another. While this is no doubt a strong argument, the Copenhagen interpretation as such totally evades the real question, which is how the quantummechanical description at a microscopic level becomes converted into a classical one at the macroscopic level, even (presumably) in cases of the type described above, where a literal extrapolation of the quantum mechanical formation would lead to a quite non-classical account of the macroscopic world. It seems to the present author that in so far as this question is addressed at all in the writings of Bohr and Heisenberg, it is answered only by implicitly assuming that there really is a qualitative distinction between the microscopic and macroscopic levels of reality, and in particular that there comes some point on the apparent continuum where one can say that the quantum-mechanical description simply stops (in effect, when one can apply the standard textbook 'measurement axioms'). But, as numerous detailed examinations of specific measurement procedures have made clear (see for example references 5, 11, 12), and as we discussed earlier, the physics involved in \\*measurement' is no different from any other kind of physics, and there seems no point at which it is natural to invoke the violent discontinuity of description which the Copenhagen interpretation would seem to require; nor is it helpful (though it is no doubt true) to remark that in most real-life situations it will not matter where the \\*cut' is introduced, so long as it occurs somewhere.

In this interpretation the description [3] of the final state of the 'universe' after a measurement has been made merely gives us statistical information about the distribution of results obtained in a long series of trials using identical pieces of apparatus and identical initial conditions, and nothing more; the question 'In what macroscopic state is this particular apparatus on this particular occasion?' is one which simply does not lie within the competence of quantum mechanics to answer. The. formalism is simply a calculus for predicting, from given macroscopic initial conditions, the probability of various macroscopic outcomes. This interpretation, while no doubt internally self-consistent, has the very unpleasant feature that under certain conditions it makes it impossible, even in principle, to give a quantum-mechanical description of the state of a particular macroscopic object; since the. theory is claimed to be the most fundamental description of the world which we now have and, according to many physicists, which we are. ever likely to get, this seems rather a high price to pay.

This interpretation in effect takes a number of simple and unexceptionable theorems of the formal quantum theory of measurement (e.g. the theorem that if, under suitably ideal' conditions, the same microscopic quantity is measured successively by two different macroscopic instruments, the probability of getting two different results is zero) and superposes on them a novel metaphysical superstructure. The wave function, it is claimed, describes particular macroscopic objects, not ensembles, and is never 'reduced' by a measurement, even at the level of human consciousness; thus the universe is never 'really' in a particular macroscopic state at all but is forever in a linear superposition of macroscopically different states. The apparent violent contradiction with our 'commonsense' view of the macroscopic world is argued away by claiming that, because of the formal theorems mentioned above. we would never know of the existence of the branches of the wave function which correspond to outcomes we have not observed, and that all physically observable phenomena would be the same as if the measurement had reduced the wave function. The problem that bothers critics of the Everett-. Wheeler interpretation is not (contrary to what many advocates of. this interpretation seem to believe) that they are unaware or dubious of the formal theorems on which it relies, but that they see, quite literally, no meaning in the metaphysical superstructure; in the words. of Ballentine17, Rather than deny that a state vector can be a com-. plete model of the real world, Everett and de Witt choose to redefine the real world so that a state vector (like [3]) can be a model of it.' In particular, the Everett-Wheeler interpretation seems totally unable to give an account of my subjective consciousness, on any particular occasion, of observing a particular outcome; to say that this consciousness is fallacious, even if a meaning can be attached to the words, is not an explanation!.

But as a solution of the conceptual problem it is a non-starter; if taken seriously, it confuses the (usually justified) assertion that the correct quantum mechanical description (supplemented, of course, by the measurement axioms) will give the same experimental predictions as a classical description in which the system is in a definite state, but our information is such that we can only talk in terms of probabilities, with the assertion that the macroscopic system actually is in a definite state. The latter statement is in transparent violation of the interpretation of the quantum formalism as applied at the microscopic level, so unless one is prepared either to modify the interpretation discontinuously somewhere on the way from the microworld to the macroworld, or to embrace the fullblooded 'statistical' interpretation (see above), the argument seems internally inconsistent. In fact, it only looks plausible at all because of a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of the density-matrix formalism (see the discussion in d'Espagnat '8, section 7.2).

There is one possible chink in the reasoning which leads to the paradox which is so obvious that it is really rather surprising that in the debates of the last fifty years or so it has attracted so little attention. It is quite simply that the assumption that the laws of quantum mechanics apply to macroscopic, complex and possibly highly-organized systems of matter, in the same way as they do to microscopic objects such as elections and atoms, is just that: an assumption, for which at the time of writing there is no direct and little circumstantial evidence. Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to note that the only time that the average physicist ever needs to write down a wave function of the type [3] is precisely when he is discussing the quantum measurement paradox; in his ordinary working life, be he a theorist or an experimentalist, he never needs to deal with superpositions of macroscopically different states'9, and hence never produces any evidence either for or against their existence. In other words, there is simply no convincing evidence that macroscopic superpositions of the type [3] exist in nature. It is therefore quite conceivable that at the level of complex, macroscopic objects the quantum mechanical superposition principle simply fails to give a correct account of the behavior of the system. One alternative possibility, for example, is that as more and more particles are involved in the linear superposition it gradually and continuously evolves into one or other of its branches, the probability of its ending up in a particular branch being determined by random factors in such a way that in an ensemble of experiments the statistical predictions of the quantum measurement axioms are verified. However, once one decides that the formalism is not sacrosanct, there are clearly many other schemes which could be considered, any of which would preserve the predictions of the quantum formalism at the microlevel while allowing the occurrence of definite events at the macrolevel. It is needless to add that any concrete proposal of this type would require us to introduce new physical laws which are not contained in the quantum formalism itself and which, while important at the macrolevel, would presumably have negligible effect at the level of one-, two- or fewparticle systems. For some suggestions as to a possible definition of the property which discriminates cases in which these laws would be important or unimportant, see reference 1, section 3. ",

I believe that the answer is to be sought on a number of different levels. At the most technical level, there seems to be a widespread belief that all solutions of this type have already been refuted by theory or experiment or both. This is quite simply a misconception. As regards theory, the only theoretical consideration which would invalidate such a proposal is simply the demand that the quantum formalism should apply universally, which merely begs the question; theorems of the von Neumann type2o, which in effect simply state. that the notion of objective properties cannot be incorporated within. the quantum formalism, are clearly irrelevant in this context. As regards experiment, the often-repeated claim that experiment has shown beyond reasonable doubt that 'quantum mechanics works at the. macroscopic level' (or 'applies to macroscopic systems') embodies a fundamental confusion. I have discussed this point in considerable detail in reference 1, and will merely summarize the conclusion here. Even the most spectacular of the so-called \\*macroscopic quantum phenomena' (Josephson effect, flux quantization, etc.) in themselves give no evidence at all for the existence of the states of the general form [3] which are necessary to establish the quantum measurement paradox, nor does the detailed agreement (such as it is) between the quantum-mechanically calculated and the observed properties of macroscopic systems (binding energies, excitation spectra, etc.) yield any more evidence in this direction. In the technical language introduced in reference 1, all these phenomena can be, and routinely are, explained in terms of the properties of states with 'disconnectivity' of the order of 1, 2, or at most a few, while the state described by. equation [3] has typically a disconnectivity of order $10^{23}$ .There simply is no direct experimental evidence, at the time of writing, that such states actually exist.

With few exceptions (who include David Bohm2'), scientists of the last 300 years or so have been deeply committed to a form of reductionism which holds, in effect, that the behavior of a complex system of matter must be simply the sum of the behavior of its constituent parts. Whether it is actually profitable to describe it in these terms is, of course, a different question, and it seems to me that it would be perfectly consistent to subscribe to this kind of 'weak' reductionism while nevertheless accepting the validity and desirability of higher-level descriptions; in terms of the map-making analogy developed above, this would be like claiming that it would in principle be possible to make a perfect and complete map which would describe in minute detail every last topological feature, but that there is no practical purpose for which it would be useful to do so. What is essential to 'weak' reductionism in the sense referred to is the assumption that the experimental behavior of a complex system such as a solid, a biological organism or the human brain could 'in principle' be completely predicted if one knew the laws which describe the behavior of the individual atoms (or nucleons, or quarks...) which compose it and also the relevant initial conditions on the equations. (Whether one could in practice ever know all these things is, again, a different question.) What is excluded by this assumption is the possibility that there are new physical laws which appear only at the level of complex systems, so that the result of a solution of (let us say) Schrodinger's equation for the $10^{23}$ -odd electrons and nuclei composing a small biological organism might give results which are not only practically useless but are actually wrong. To put it another way, such a prejudice excludes a priori the possibility that complexity is itself a relevant variable which may require the laws of physics to be modified or generalized, in the same way as high velocities require relativity theory and small distances (or high energies) require quantum mechanics.

The behavior of gases has been analyzed in terms of the constituent molecules, that of molecules in terms of atoms, that of atoms in terms of the nucleons and electrons composing them, that of nucleons in terms of quarks, and so on. Certainly, there is no particular reason to believe that there is any special new ingredient which has to be added to quantum theory at the level of small or even large molecules which is not already present at the lower levels; if anything, the often spectacular agreement between theory and experiment leads to the opposite conclusion. Moreover, while the situation regarding bulk systems of condensed matter is inevitably less clearcut (in that totally rigorous and exact calculations in terms of the microscopic constituents are not usually available, even with the power of today's computers) there seems no strong reason to believe that, as regards the one- and two-particle correlations which are essentially all (or nearly all) that experiment usually measures, a quantum-mechanical calculation based on Schrodinger's equation as applied to the constituent electrons and nuclei will give misleading results. (As discussed above, it is quite a different question whether the results will be useful.) However, this situation is not one which we should regard as totally obvious a priori, a scientist from Mars, unconditioned by 300 years of reductionist science, might well find it a rather remarkable feature of our current understanding of the world. In any case, the fact that the reductionist assumption does apparently hold (or at any rate does not obviously fail) for the rather coarse features of the quantum formalism which are reflected in the calculation of one- and two-particle correlations is no evidence at all that it will continue to hold for the much more subtle features of the formalism which lead to the measurement paradox; as discussed in detail in reference 1, failure at a certain level of 'disconnectivity' would preserve all the well-established existing agreements between theory and experiment while removing the paradox. The prejudice that no such failure will occur is no doubt the simplest and (were it not for the measurement paradox) the most elegant assumption, but we have no a priori guarantee that nature will continue to entertain us with simple behavior as she has seemed to do in the past!.

Clearly the prevalence of this belief, not merely among the physics community itself but among the general public, is extremely useful to those who seek hundreds of millions of dollars or pounds of public money to build the next round of high-energy accelerators, since it enables them to argue not only that particle physics and cosmology are 'fundamental' areas of scientific research (which they unarguably are) but that they are the only such fundamental area, and that advances in other areas of science (or at any rate other areas of physics) will not qualitatively change our world-view in the way that may come out of investment in these areas. Were it to become seriously envisaged that the physics of complex matter need not be, in all respects, reducible to that of its constituent parts, this argument might perhaps be examined a little more sceptically; one might begin to ask, in fact, for the actual evidence that pushing back the frontiers of physics in the direction of the very small or the very large will in the end change our basic understanding of the world in a way more fundamental than an equivalent thrust in the direction of the very complex..

What has changed the situation qualitatively in the last decade or two is our ability to produce in the laboratory systems where there is a genuine hope of. attaining the conditions where not only does quantum mechanics. predict that the state is a linear superposition of macroscopically different states, but where the consequences of such a description are different, in an experimentally testable way, from the consequences of other types of assumption such as the scheme suggested above, in which already by this stage the system has evolved into a definite macroscopic state. I have discussed the conditions necessary to attain this state of affairs, and the systems which are the most promising candidates for it, in detail elsewhere22, and will here merely review briefly what seems to be the experiment most likely to be feasible. One takes a superconducting ring closed by a Josephson junction (rf SQUID') and imposes on it a controlled external magnetic flux. The system will then respond by generating currents which circulate in such a way that the total trapped flux, $\\varphi$ , is different from that applied externally; in thermal equilibrium it will choose a value of $\\varphi$ which makes its free energy $F(\\varphi)$ a local minimum. This allows (at least) two different kinds of experiments. In one kind (known in the literature as \\*macroscopic quantum tunnelling' or MQT) one traps the flux in a metastable minimum and tries to detect its 'escape' into a more stable minimum by a quantum tunnelling process. In the other ('macroscopic quantum. coherence' or MQC) one chooses the value of the externally imposed flux so that $F(\\varphi)$ has two degenerate minima which are separated by an energy barrier; the situation then resembles that found in the ammonia molecule, and one looks for the coherent oscillations between the two states which are the analog of the ammonia inversion resonance. The point of both kinds of experiment is that by any reasonable criterion the states which are connected by the process of tunnelling through the potential barrier are macroscopically different (in particular, a macroscopic number of electrons circulate clockwise or counter-clockwise in the two states respectively). Thus, observation of the quantum-mechanically predicted behavior should constitute at least circumstantial evidence (cf. below) that the quantum formalism still works for such macroscopic superpositions, and conversely failure of the predictions might suggest the hypothesis that at the macroscopic level quantum mechanics needs to be replaced or supplemented by physical laws of a qualitatively different type.

However, it is difficult to assess to what extent they exclude alternative hypotheses. The MQC experiment, if it can be done, should be much more informative in this respect. In fact, it can be shown24 that, provided suitable values of the parameters can be attained, the behavior predicted by quantum mechanics in this experiment is in confict with the conjunction of two very basic 'commonsense' assumptions about the macroscopic world, namely that a macroscopic system which has available to it two macroscopically different states: ",

Yet I find nothing a priori appealing about the idea. We know from results of general relativity (Penrose', Hawking and Ellis4) that there are otherwise seemingly acceptable space-times for which no Cauchy hypersurface exists. More serious are two other objections. In the first place, the accuracy with which one needs to know the initial data in order to be certain about the qualitative development of a system is absurdly unreasonable (Born5, Feynman et al.6) and easily swamped by quantum uncertainties (if that is not begging the question). In the second place, there is always the problem of deciding what initial data one should be choosing.

I see no reason to be happier about feeding probabilities into the universe's initial state than peppering them throughout the space-time, as is done in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. If, on the other hand, the initial state is to be determined uniquely by some new principle, then we have the problem of understanding the extreme complication and curious interplay between precisely-operating physical laws on the one hand, and the presence of apparent total ran-. domness on the other. The picture is not an entirely hopeless one, however. One is beginning to become accustomed to the great math-. ematical complication, variety and apparent randomness that can arise with very simple and precise mathematical transformations, especially where iterative procedures are involved (cf.

For an overall consistency of the physics involved,. it is argued that gravity ought also to be critically relevant to the. quantum-mechanical reduction process. But it is gravity in its role of. providing a gravitational entropy that enters. In the early stages of the. universe (at the big bang) the entropy content of the matter was high. The second law arises because, at the singularity, something constrained the entropy of gravity to be extremely low, whereas the potential for entropy content of (conformally) curved space-time was enormously high.

The ultimate high value of entropy for a gravitationally clumped object is achieved by the black-hole state. This entropy can be given in precise terms by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula (cf. Wald24) and we find that for an ordinary black hole, resulting from the collapse of, say, a ten solar-mass star, the entropy per baryon is some twenty orders of magnitude larger than even the seemingly huge. value of $10^{8}$ or so (taking units with Boltzmann's constant as unity). for the thermal black-body radiation left over from the hot big bang..

For technical reasons concerned with the fabrication of transistors and diodes which can. operate effectively at liquid helium temperatures, we have chosen 430. MHz as the centre frequency for this receiver. Using state-of-the-art microwave GaAs field-effect transistors (GaAs FETs) and variablecapacitance diodes, we have been able to achieve an in-band noise temperature at the tank circuit of a few K; that is, comparable with the condensed-matter temperature of the weak link ring $(4.2\\textbf{K})$ .The receiver consists of a chain of three UHF amplifiers, operating at temperatures of $4.2\\mathrm{~K~}$ $77\\textbf{K}$ and room temperature $(\\simeq300~\\mathrm{~K~})$ , respectively. Each amplifier has electronically-adjustable matching networks, incorporating GaAs varactor diodes, on the input and output. The power gain and approximate in-band noise temperature of each amplifier stage is given in Figure 7.5. As can be seen, UHF circulators are provided for in-band isolation (40 dB) between the second- and third-stage amplifiers and the third-stage amplifier and the UHF mixer. Broad-band attenuation is provided between each amplifier stage (not shown) and between the third-stage amplifier and the mixer. Very careful attention is paid in this receiver system to properly terminating, in a broad-band sense, the output terminal of the mixer. Without due care being taken over this detail, we find that the noise temperature of the receiver can easily increase by an order of magnitude. In addition, we arrange for both the cryogenically-. cooled and room-temperature receiver electronics to be extremely well-shielded electromagnetically, effectively from. $\\sim1\\mathrm{Hz}$ upwards. As a further precaution against unwanted external noise being injected into the tank circuit (and hence the weak-link ring), all active devices used in the receiver system (e.g. GaAs FETs and GaAs diodes) are powered by very-low-noise FET-based power supplies, operated from car batteries. This combination of broad-band (roughly a few MHz to. ${\\tt>}3{\\bf G H z}$ reverse isolation, very-low-noise amplifiers and effective electromagnetic shielding and power-supply noise-reduction techniques leads to an all-up broad-band receiver-noise temperature at the tank circuit of approximately a few K.

In a practical arrangement the tank-circuit coil inductor is actually placed inside the weak link ring 13. As far as we are aware, this non-invasive probing of a single-quantum mechanical object by a macroscopic apparatus constitutes a radical departure from conventional approaches to the problem of measurement in quantum systems. In this context it is apparent from the susceptibility patterns of Figure 7.6 that, using noninvasive measurement techniques, it is perfectly practicable to observe a macroscopic quantum object in an amplitude superposition of macroscopically different states. For the case of the weak link ring of Figure 7.6, these macroscopically different states are the quantised magnetic-flux states which we deliberately do not choose to measure. This, therefore, provides one experimental retort to the often-posed paradox of Schrodinger's cat'4, although, of course, a superconducting weak link ring is an extraordinarily coherent object compared with a room-temperature cat.

We now consider the conjugate mode of a superconducting weak link ring, where the link is small enough in cross-section to couple all possible flux states of the ring together; that is, couplings $n\\Phi_{0}\\longrightarrow(n,\\pm1,\\pm2,\\pm3\\dots)\\Phi_{0}$ are allowed up to very high order in. the number of flux quanta transferred. The ring is now in an amplitude superposition of all possible flux states so that the flux in the ring is extremely ill-defined. From the uncertainty relation [9] this implies that charge, in units of. $q=2e$ , should become well defined (localised) at the weak link. This limit, which we shall term the 'charge mode', constitutes the macroscopic quantum-mechanical state of a weak link ring conjugate to the flux mode described by the matrix equations [10] and [13]. By comparison with the quantised flux states of a superconducting ring, we can imagine the weak link capacitor possessing instantaneous polarisation states of different integer. $(N)q$ charge, where $N=0,\\pm1,\\pm2.$ .etc., from which we can build up a mat-. rix description of the charge mode by analogy with [10].

As is well known, some of the most significant of these ideas were left in a not-completely-explicit and even somewhat ambiguous stage by their authors. Moreover, some of them were obliterated to some extent by the considerable development of the quantum formalism. This is because this formalism was essentially rooted in Dirac's and von Neumann's works and laid therefore - compared to the Copenhagen views - a greater emphasis on the notion of a (microscopic) quantum state (or equivalently on that of a state preparation procedure) and correspondingly a smaller emphasis on the consideration of the experimental conditions under which such and such a particular proposition (bearing on a physical system) can be tested. Because he neither shuns nor conceals behind general statements the most baffling consequences of the undiluted Copenhagen views, Wheeler gives us in his recent articles (and particularly in the one quoted) extremely valuable clues as to what the basic ideas are,. on which the view in question should be anchored if we want them to be non-ambiguous and to constitute a fully self-consistent set.

Or if it is not, if such a task is not entirely meaningless, at least it is one which, in their opinion, can and should be entirely left to the philosophers. They then claim that we should not try to speak of the quantum objects by themselves and that any valid description of the quantum phenomena must be anchored on the notion of these. obviously existing objects and events (and in particular on the two closely related notions of 'complete experimental set up' and of 'conditions of observation' so often appearing in Niels Bohr's works).

And one of the notions which one was trying to discard, namely the notion of quantum objects existing in some absolute sense independently of the conditions of observation, seems thereby to be inescapably creeping back. Closely related with this difficulty is the one that macro-objectivism seems to require a rather sharp distinction to be made between classical and quantum objects (and events), whereas physics proper does not seem really to give us any clue as to how such a distinction could be made objective in any sense that would be in harmony with the basic ideas of, precisely, macro-objectivism. Admittedly irreversibility has -- at least as regards. events - been considered by many authors as a good candidate for playing the role of a criterion in that respect. But, again, it seems difficult to define irreversibility in a way which would make no reference whatsoever, not even an implicit one, to the limitations of the abilities of the community of observers. In fact, the proposals that have been made along these lines do not seem to comply with the requisites that, for consistency, a macro-objectivist must have in mind when he considers an 'objective' macroscopic event. An alternative possibility, namely the idea that quantum mechanics should only be an approximate theory, remains open. But it is not substantiated by any experimental fact and it would be quite a new thing if a momentous scientific change were initiated neither by new findings nor by new theoretical developments but just by considerations that can well be called philosophical about the nature of reality.

Moreover it seems that he will thus remain closer to the real spirit of the Copenhagen founding fathers. In his book Physics and Philosophy, Heisenberg, for instance, considers that a statement 'can be made objective' if we may consistently claim that its content does not depend on the conditions under which it can be verified. And when he then defines several varieties of realism, he dismisses as meaningless any 'metaphysical realism' (this is the expression he used) that would not reduce either to what he calls practical realism or to what he calls 'dogmatic realism'; that is, to a conception asserting that most or, respectively, all of our meaningful statements about the material world can be 'made objective', in the sense just specified. Now what is most significant in this standpoint of Heisenberg is not the distinction he makes between practical and dogmatic realisms (although this, of course, is important too). It is the very fact, first, that this author does define what he calls objectivity and realism instead of considering that these are primary concepts and, second, that he defines them by referring to what can actually be done. By choosing to define these terms and to define them in this way, Heisenberg in fact makes verification the primary concept; that is, he chooses as a primary concept in science one which basically refers to the actions of men. This choice has implications which are in fact so momentous that most of the physicists who consider themselves as agreeing with the Copenhagen viewpoint seem somehow not to have dared taking them quite fully into account.

However let us not be abused by the fact that in current scientific language the word 'phenomenon' is very often understood as just signifying a type of event taking place within a reality whose concept is tacitly understood as being the ultimate refer-. ent. Wheeler's sentence 'no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon' very clearly dismisses this 'commonsense' view. Indeed his 'phenomena' should be understood in the etymological sense. (which is also the one in which Kant used the word); namely, 'what is observed and about which an agreement gets established amongst the community of all people in their right mind'. It is important to stress that in Wheeler's paper there is no primary concept other than these two (or just 'meaning' if we consider that 'phenomenon' refers to 'meaning'). In particular, we shall not understand this article if we. consider that there is another primary concept, namely 'reality', tacitly underlying it. The article in question makes no use of such a concept but if it did there is no doubt that reality would be defined relative to one of the aforenamed two concepts or to both - again, just as is the case in Kant's work.

For example, the splitting of a uranium nucleus, though it is called irreversible, could be undone in principle. It then would not count as a phenomenon. Indeed, if we are right, his way of solving the well-known quantum riddle 'How is it possible that mere information (that is, \"software\") should in some cases (e.g. that of the Schrodinger cat) modify the real state of macroscopic things (hardware)?' is as follows. He answers by just denying to this postulated hardware any existence of its own. This way of solving the problem will be analysed and discussed in the next section. ",

This gave rise to the. so-called 'modal logic', the need of which, although it is questioned by some, is made plausible by the observation that in ordinary logic the relation 'if  then' (called 'material implication', symbol $\\supset$ ) does not. actually play the role it is intuitively expected to play. For example it does not make it possible to identify the definition of the word magnetic, applied to some object $x.$ to the sentence 'If small iron specks are in the vicinity of. $x.$ they get attracted, for according to ordinary formal logic this sentence is true, in particular, whenever it is the case. that no small iron specks are in the vicinity of $x$ , whatever substance $x$ is composed of ... One way of removing this difficulty (it is not the. only way, see below) is obviously to introduce a new relation, called strict implication' or 'entailment' and reading 'if - then necessarily'.

Unquestionably - and this is particularly obvious in quantum physics - we do not have any direct knowledge that an object has or does not have a given property. To gain such a knowledge we must make a measurement; so that it seems appropriate to identify a property of an object with an aptitude this object has of inducing a given definite result when subjected to a definite test (measurement). This observation has the consequence that if we choose the strict implication procedure for defining the dispositional terms, then it is the whole realm of all the properties of objects (including even their very existence) that must be defined this way.

Let it be mentioned however that, in order to define in a precise way the notion of strict implication, modal logic has to introduce the notion of 'possible situations' (or, as they are often called, 'possible worlds') differing from the actual situation (or 'world'), and has to specify that the implication under study holds not only in the actual situation but also in all these possible situations. When applied to the definition of properties this method obviously implies that measurements which, actually, are not done, should be considered. For example, if it is asserted that a photon has. some definite momentum p, because it has been so prepared, what is meant, according to this method, is that if a measurement (of the photon momentum), which actually is not made, were made with the help of some appropriate instrument (which actually is not present) it would give result p. For that reason the strict implications considered here may also be called 'counterfactual implications'. But one point should be stressed. We must specify what the set is of all the 'possible. situations' used in the definition. Technically this set is sometimes called the 'sphere of accessibility' associated with the actual situation under study. Clearly a great many physically conceivable situations should not. be included in it. In classical physics, for example, if we want to counterfactually define the fact for a system to have some given energy, quite. obviously we must exclude from the corresponding sphere of accessibility all the conceivable physical situations in which the system in question interacts with other systems in such a way that its 'energy' is not definable. When -- explicitly or, more often, implicitly - we try to apply this procedure of definition to quantum mechanics (see section 4 below), the restrictions we must impose on the sphere of accessibility are even more stringent (to avoid misunderstandings, let it be mentioned right away that the thus-obtained description of quantum mechanics is nevertheless nearer to von Neumann's than to Bohr's views)..

For brevity let us simply note here that if this alternative is chosen then, properly speaking, a system. $s$ may have property $A$ only when the experimental set-up is such as to allow for a. measurement of. $A$ Otherwise the sentence $^{\\leftarrow}S$ has property $A^{\\prime}$ is 'worse than false', for it is simply meaningless. Although a few isolated sentences of the Copenhagen founding fathers seem to refer to a kind of macroobjectivism which, in turn, would tacitly refer to counterfactuality in the macroscopic domain, it remains true that in the microscopic domain, at least, the method of partial definition of properties is actually the one. which is in agreement with the 'hard core' of the Copenhagen standpoint. (and, in particular, with the substance of Bohr's reply to Einstein). It can be considered that in Wheeler's article - in which no sharp distinction. between these two domains is made and in which the notion of a hardware 'reality out here' is banned, as we saw -- even the physical properties of the macroscopic objects are supposed to be defined by this man-centred method (it is man centred because in it the instruments can only be defined as the 'things' that serve to measure)..

Moreover we understand somewhat more precisely the root of our vague feeling that this conception is baffling. It lies in the fact that we are not used to defining properties (and existence) by the partial definition method.

B (the effect) cannot be that the pointer co-ordinate takes a value within a given interval (say, between 4 and 5 on the scale) since it is not true that in all the cases in which we do look we observe that special result.

These authors could show that in quantum theory there exist some non-local physical quantities that are measurable in principle, at least 'in the restricted sense that it can be checked whether or not the physical system under study is in an eigenstate of the considered quantity. Moreover, the measurements in question are non-demolition measurements; that is, they leave the system in this state. They can thus be repeated as often as desired. The point then is that we can monitor such a non-local eigenstate (that is, we can continuously check that the system still is in it) in any referential we choose. Under these conditions an ordinary local measurement of some other quantity pertaining to the system cannot reduce the state other than on the hyperplane defined by the time of this measurement in this chosen referential (any other assumption would lead to a contradiction between two sets of predictions which are both verifiable in the referential in question). Hence the collapse of the quantum state cannot be considered as being a covariant process. This does not imply a violation of relativity conceived of as an operational theory since, as several authors including the quoted ones have shown, relativistic causality in this sense is not violated. However it would imply a violation of this same relativistic causality -- but now conceived of in a realistic sense - if we were to assume that the nonlocal state under consideration is 'physically real' (in the sense made precise by the counterfactual method) and is reduced by the ordinary measurement considered above (the Everett approach, in which no collapse takes place, is thereby immune to this criticism). Now the necessity of reducing the state vector upon measurement has always been viewed as an unpleasant feature of the conception discussed here that state vectors of micro-systems are, by themselves, elements of reality. But now we see that this necessity implies the existence of an actual contradiction between such a conception and relativity, also understood in some realistic sense.

In his theory, many of the observables of ordinary. quantum mechanics are in fact reduced to this low status of secondary qualities, but the positions of the particles - or, more precisely, the. numbers of fermions at any point in space - are not, and in the last analysis we must indeed consider that these quantities are there implicitly defined, just as in classical physics, through the counterfactual. implication method (since, at any rate, it is clear they are not defined through the partial definition method).

Modern physicists tend to say instead 'It is in spacetime', and the followers of Einstein point out that, since spacetime is not an a priori mode of our sensibility, the very fact that physics forces us to this assertion shows that spacetime is real, quite independently from us. I do not go as far as this. In view of the results of the foregoing discussion I feel inclined to consider that even spacetime (and locality, and events and so on) is a notion that owes much to the structure of our mind and that independent reality is in no way embedded in it. However, the argument of the Einsteinians remains impressive. Notions such as that of spacetime and everything that goes with it are not primitive modes of thought. They therefore must have come to us from somewhere, and it is natural to think that they reflect something of independent reality. But, again, in view of the foregoing analyses, it seems that they reflect this 'something' in such a distorted way that it is impossible for mankind to reconstruct with full clarity, from such a poor information, what independent reality 'really is'. In short, independent reality is -- and will remain -- veiled to us. ",

In particular the difficulty disappears (at least as long as only local measurements are considered) in the approach (to which we believe that Wheeler holds fast) which consists in defining properties and states exclusively by means of the partial definition method and which therefore allows no counterfactual interpretation whatsoever to be given of the so-called initial state' of the system (or, in better words, of the state preparation procedure to which this system was subjected). On the other hand, as we said, the indirect, non-local measurements of the EPR type raise, in this approach, some problems of their own6 that can hardly be considered as being solved and that could, therefore, create some doubts concerning the internal consistency of any \\*physics of the phenomena'. This comes in addition to the difficulty that empirical reality is of course the one we have to deal with both in scientific and ordinary life.

It shows therefore that the meaningcentred approach of empirical reality which is so characteristic of modern physics is, at least, not hopelessly inconsistent.

At the time of Epicurus an enormous number of simple questions could not be answered scientifically and in the course of showing that deities were unnecessary Epicurus therefore had to point out that we must sometimes make specific hypotheses. For example, concerning the respective sizes of the earth and the sun he advocated the choice of the more natural assumption, which is of course that the sun is smaller, and he stressed that, qualitatively at least, it is possible to explain many phenomena this way without having recourse to the notions he did not like. Now, clearly he was too daring in putting forward the idea that the sun is smaller than the earth, as we might perhaps be too daring if we claimed that Bell's theory is correct. But we shall understand this philosopher somewhat better if we observe that the point he really wanted to make was just that at least one solution to his problem could be consistently thought to exist (my thanks are due to Miss Anne Richard for drawing my attention to this aspect of Epicurus' assertion). It is a similar idea I am trying to convey here. Let it be pointed out moreover that Epicurus' argument would be considered as correct even if a decision as to which one of the two heavenly bodies is larger finally turned out to lie outside human intellectual abilities, and that the analogy with what I have in mind concerning the present problem would then be even closer.

Using the concept of wave-packet collapse to provide a physical interpretation of the quantum formalism is contrary to the spirit of Bohr's epistemological position. Nevertheless the argument is often put in the following way in CIQM. The introduction of a device capable of determining through which slit a particle passes induces a collapse of the wave function in the apparatus and a consequent loss of interference. Such a collapse follows from the assumption that the wave function provides a complete description of an individual system. In fact it is an hypothesis added to the quantum formalism and not an integral part of that formalism, although this is not the impression given in most texts.

In particular, some effects in non-linear optics experiments, i.e. the ejection of a photo-electron'', photo-ionization of a gas38 and fluorescence39, occur even when the laser frequency is in fact below the necessary threshold for the process (provided the beam is put in a non-stationary state by focusing or by creation of a pulse). These effects can be interpreted in both CIQM and SIQM. However, by. providing a detailed description of the individual trajectories and particle energies involved, SIQM can make testable predictions which. are not possible in CIQM. In SIQM it is possible to predict at which points the particles of increased energy will be found and hence exactly where the effects should be observed4o.

However any interpretation of quantum mechanics which asserts the existence of individual particle trajectories is faced with a problem when the question of quantum statistical behaviour arises. Brillouin1 had already in 1927 considered this problem. He argued that even if particles are identical a priori, it is easy nevertheless to distinguish them by their history. He then finds the auxiliary assumptions that enable quantum statistics to be obtained with distinguishability of elements. When the elements are assumed to be independent classical statistics result, in order to obtain quantum statistics some correlation between the distinguishable elements must be assumed. Further, as has been more recently emphasized by Feynman42, no classical model with local interactions between the elements can ever reproduce all the results of. quantum mechanics.

In classical field theory, part of the requirement could be formulation in terms of differential (as distinct from integral) equations in three-plus-one-dimensional space-time. But it seems clear that quantum mechanics requires a much bigger configuration space. One can formulate a locality requirement by permitting arbitrary external fields and requiring that variations thereof have consequences only in their future light cones. In that case the fields could be used to set measuring instruments, and one comes into difficulty with quantum. predictions for correlations related to those of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen'8. But the introduction of external fields is questionable. So I am unable to prove, or even formulate clearly, the proposition that a sharp formulation of quantum field theory, such as that set out here,. must disrespect serious Lorentz invariance. But it seems to me that this is probably so. ",

Then the chance of finding them along the $V$ and $U$ axes is $\\sum_{a,b}P_{a b}p_{a}(V)p_{b}(U)$ which is equal to ${\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{4}}}(1-U.V)$ .

The probabilities for the correlated states in the case that the total spin is zero are $P_{a b}$ equal $\\frac{1}{8}$ if $^{a}$ and $^b$ are different states, and $-\\frac{1}{8}$ if they are the same.

We can say there are four ways or conditions. by which the electron can go through the holes, corresponding to the. $++,+-,-+,$ and -- conditions. If we take up spin to correspond to going through hole number 1 and down spin to represent going through hole 2, then the other variable corresponding to spin in the $x$ direction means going through the two holes equally in phase.. Ordinarily we cannot say which hole it goes through and what the. phase relation is (just as ordinarily we do not say which way the z-. spin is and which way the $x$ -spin is) but now we can and do. For. example, $f_{--}$ gives the probability of going through hole 2 but 180 degrees out of phase (whatever that could mean). For each of these conditions we can calculate what the chance is that the electron arrives at a point $x$ along the screen. For example, $P_{++}(x)$ , the probability for arrival at $x$ for the condition $++$ (through 1 in phase) and $P_{+}\\ldots(x)_{\\mathrm{{}}}$ the probability for $+-$ (through 1 but out of phase) are. sketched roughly in Figure 13.1 as the curves $(b)$ and $(c)$ respectively.

Photons and electrons do not occur at the lowest level of complexity, even though these particles dominate development of explicate order. At the lowest level of graphical complexity there occur 'hidden variables' (in the literature of graphical-particle theory the adjective. inaccessible' rather than 'hidden' has been used) which have disappeared at the photon-electron level but which are responsible for the existence and properties of elementary nuclear particles which precede photons and electrons in the hierarchy of complexity.6. (Graphical-particle theory' makes a distinction between 'elementary. particles' and particles accessible to hard-scientific observations interpreted through explicate order, but explanation of this distinction will not be attempted here. Suffice it to say that there is a connection with hidden' variables.) An example of a \\*hidden' variable is a feature of graphical order called 'color.' The property of 'color' is not exhibited by any particles accessible to the hard-scientific measurements based on explicate order, but a full picture of graphical order demands recognition of 'color' and other 'hidden' variables. At the level where such variables function there has not yet developed the degree of complexity prerequisite to the space-time on which explicate order relies. Theorists who use graphical complexity to understand particles do not employ the term 'implicate order,' but where 'color' and other hidden' variables occur such a term may be appropriate.. ",

Bohr gave convincing arguments that, in the realm of atomic physics, no theory could give predictions going beyond those attainable from his observer-based formulation of quantum theory. However, the experimental situation encountered in atomic physics is far from universal. It involves large preparing and detecting devices, which are considered to be parts of the full classically-described macroscopic environment, plus a tiny quantum system. This quantum system must be small enough so that during the interval between its preparation and detection its influence upon the macro-. scopic environment is negligible. For if the quantum system influences the macroscopic environment then phase information is transferred to. this environment, and the Schrodinger equation fails. The macroscopic environment must then be described quantum mechanically, which contradicts the requirement that it be described classically. Consequently, as the quantum system is increased in size it must eventually. reach the stage where neither the classical nor quantum description is adequate. To deal with such intermediate situations it would appear necessary to treat in a unified way the full physical system of macro-. scopic environment plus quantum object. ",

Recently Bohm and Hiley2 have themselves stressed the important role played by the Clifford. algebras $C_{n}$ here, since the automorphisms of the (even) Clifford algebras $C_{2r}$ are all inner and 'any theory based on an algebra can always be put in an implicate order by an inner automorphism of the. algebra'. To make the notation precise, I am using $\\mathrm{C}_{n}$ for the algebra generated by $n$ anticommuting elements, which I usually denote by $E_{i}(i=1\\dots n)$ , but in the case of quaternions, $C_{2}$ , I use $e_{1},e_{2}$ , and set $\\boldsymbol{e}_{3}=e_{1}\\boldsymbol{e}_{2}$ . Thus $C_{n}$ has a basis of $2^{n}$ elements, including the unit, which I call 1. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the algebra is over the field of reals, $R.$ ",

Here the elementary particles are not thought of as extended structures in space-time but are regarded primarly as point objects with internal' variables such as spin, isospin, hypercharge, charm, etc., together with the usual 'external' space-time properties like momentum, mass, etc. This way of proceeding seems inescapable and is forced on us, not so much by physical considerations, but by technical difficulties arising from the mathematics itself. Nevertheless, this approach has received considerable impetus with the realisation that the mathematical theory of fibre bundles, a theory developed for very different reasons, provides a natural descriptive language for these ideas.

The fundamental difference arises because we do not give a basic role to field-in-interaction on a space-time mani-. fold. Rather we start by taking the notion of process as fundamental; not a process in space-time, but a process from which we hope. eventually to abstract basic relationships that will allow us to reconstruct our present notions of space-time. Thus, space-time can be regarded as an order of relationships. Such an idea is not new. It was proposed, circa seventeenth century, by Leibniz, who regarded space. as the order of coexistence and time as the order of succession.. ",

Bohm' has already indicated how this particular feature can be understood in analogy with the hologram, which stores nonlocally in itself information defining local relationships. Of course, in this case, the notion of a local order is provided by the material object being hologrammed. In the more general situation that we are considering, however, there are no material objects and therefore no obvious notion of locality. The reason why there are no objects in the usual sense is because the fundamental order is not a regular arrangement of objects, but rather a process in which the objects appear as quasi-stable semi-autonomous structures. These are made manifest in the explicate order which, in some approximation, corresponds to the usual Euclidean or Reimanian geometry. It is therefore in the explicate order that locality emerges. Any appearance of non-locality would then arise from the fact that not all processes can be made local' together. The total order must therefore contain within itself the relationship of locality needed to explicate this geometric order. Such a relationship will require some special principle which is at present unknown. However, a similar problem arises in Chew's2 S-matrix approach and, as he shows in this volume, it is the soft photons that provide the physical basis for such a relationship. ",

This does not mean, however, that the state vector. disappears entirely from our view. Rather, in all the physically relevant. algebras the state vectors of the usual theory can be identified with certain special entities within the algebra itself; namely, the minimum left ideals.

At about that time, George Yevick shared with me some notes he had brought back from a stay with David Bohm, concerning a classical guiding wave theory of relativistic spinning particles. While I have reservations about that work, touched upon below, I still recall the stimulus I derived from it, and the feeling that I was being directed towards truly fundamental questions by it, at an important time for me.

(The number of bits is the logarithm of the number of possibilities to the base 2; two possibilities make one bit.) But it gives infinite information, ideally, about the orientation angle of the tourmaline crystal. Indeed, the wave-function may be taken to be the orientation vector of the crystal. This information has no counterpart in classical physics, where we imagine one complete experimental set-up capable of making all possible measurements at once. With only one significant choice for the experimental arrangement, no matter how complex, the number of bits is zero. The new kind of information about the experimenter provided by the wave function is the result of complementarity, which forces us to choose which measurements we make. A wave-function tells us more about the act of measurement than about the result. It is a verb, not a noun; to treat it as a thing is a mistake in syntax. Having committed this error. one is forced to follow it with another, the idea of the collapse of the wave function. It is not that 'the' wave function 'collapses.'

It seems that the latter possibility is worth considering seriously since in the AB effect the structure of $A_{\\mu}$ is not affected by quantization. This follows from the fact that in the first quantized theory of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the field itself does not undergo any alteration. It would thus be surprising if quantization of the particle trajectory alone introduced new structural properties into the potentials. Rather, we feel that these properties must be, in a perhaps primitive form, already in existence in the classical regime. ",

Yet, to the authors' knowledge, no work has been produced which takes these analogies as a foundation on which to build a theory of electrodynamics. Rather, they have been proposed in order to eluci-. date dislocation theory by reference to the more familiar electro-. magnetic case. Consequently, the observations alluded to above, though useful pointers to an alternative understanding of the relationship between charges and fields and the role of the potentials, remain. confined to the level of comparisons. We propose in this paper to. develop a re-interpretation of the theory of a classical charged testparticle moving in an external electromagnetic field through the differential geometric language of continuous dislocation theory.

This idea makes sense since we have available to us two metrics at each space-time point which allows a comparison to be made between two states, a notion that is essential to the theory of deformed media. We emphasize that it is not that the field and particle are in some way embedded in a medium so that they bring about its deformation in a direct physical sense but rather that the state of deformation represents, or is an alternative way of thinking about, their interaction. Moreover, the deformation representing the potentials only occurs if there is a test particle present. Conversely the test particle may also potentially be represented by a deformation, but only when the field is present. Thus, the actual deformation representing $A_{\\mu}$ depends irreducibly on the presence or absence of a particle acted on by the field and cannot be thought of in any other way. It is in this way that we treat the interaction which in the ordinary theory is expressed through the velocity dependence of. the Lorentz force. This conception is rather close to the notion of wholeness introduced by Bohr, and elaborated by $\\mathbf{8ohm^{36}}$ in terms of real physical processes, in the quantum theory. Here a complete account of physical phenomena requires not only consideration of the \\*observed system' (e.g. a particle) but also detailed knowledge of the. environment, the 'observing apparatus', and these two aspects form an irreducible whole -- it would be meaningless to think of one without reference to the other. The implications of the present theory for quantum mechanics will be considered elsewhere, but we consider it significant that our approach readily generalizes to the notion of continuously dislocated phase space, as described in section 6.

But a closed system is, in dynamical terms, so extremely non-generic that there is not much which can be said in general along this line.

In that work (which considered explicitly the vehicle for carrying. primary genetic information) it was straightforwardly supposed that such an information-carrying active site would consist of a family of quantum-mechanical observables in a standard way. The mathematical properties of this family are constrained by the biological prerequisites for the stability and accessibility of the information; basically a form of the measurement problem with which Dr Bohm has dealt at such great length. Under these conditions it turned out that this family of observables, which in an abstract sense describes a perfectly good microphysical system, does not have a Hamiltonian: hence no Schrodinger equation, no wave functions, etc. It is thus. immune to study by conventional theoretical means. We may interpret the relation of this sub-system of observables to the entire molecule in which it is embedded in the following way; the active site is an example of a sub-system which is not physically fractionable from the molecule. That is, there is no physical procedure which can separate the molecule into two parts or sub-systems, one of which is the active site and the. other of which is 'everything else'. We can describe the whole molecule in standard quantum-theoretic terms (at least in principle; in fact. I believe the hydrogen molecule is still technically unconquered), but we cannot recover the site from this description. In this connection it is ironic to note that, long ago, the famous chemist Willstatter refused to accept the conventional identification of enzyme with protein: it was his contention that protein was simply an unavoidable contaminant of enzyme. In a sense, the above considerations support this view; enzyme is active site, not entire molecule, but the site is not fractionable from the molecule in which it is embedded. ",

This dramatic change of perception emerged from a fierce and fateful struggle for legitimacy and power between the members of groups championing radically different programmes of development and reform in Europe at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century. Francis Yates identified the monk Mersenne as a key figure in the demise of what he saw as a threatening, reforming and transforming Renaissance conception of the cosmos: 'Mersenne attacks and discards the old Renaissance. world; his Universal Harmony will have nothing to do with Francesco Giorgi, of whom he strongly disapproves'2. Giorgi, the Franciscan friar whose De harmonica mundi of 1525 had incorporated the unifying themes of the thirteenth-century philosopher and mystic, Ramon Lull, was one of the major figures in developing and articulating the tradition of Renaissance nature philosophy. Within this tradition, 'all of reality was a single co-ordinated domain, every region of which was. intrinsically related to every other region, so that to know the region called nature entailed knowing the whole sphere of Being within which nature was embedded'l. Furthermore, this union of the knower and the known had the consequence that a change in one resulted in a coordinated change in the other, mind and nature therefore undergoing a co-operative transformation. But to achieve this knowledge and insight, the seeker had to make a commitment to spiritual enlightenment so as to experience gnosis, knowledge that transforms both self and other, mind and nature then simultaneously changing to states of greater harmony and unity. In alchemy, this dual transformation was described as golden illumination for the mind (or soul) of the practitioner of the art; while gold emerged in the crucible, nature undergoing simultaneous transmutation with spiritual illumination. Neither could occur without the other. ",

The science which he helped to shape in the seventeenth century, and which has come down to us as the dominant tradition of Western scientific and philosophical thought, is based upon dualisms which split the unified world of the Renaissance magi into separate domains of power, particularly that between mind and nature, and the threads of these. dualisms can be found running through individual sciences as well as through our social and political structures. The struggle for unification continues against the power of established interests and habits of mind. I tend to see David Bohm's efforts to bring intelligibility and. experiential unity into physics as a part of this struggle; and his. intellectual and spiritual vision continues the tradition of the Renaissance magi, a tradition that has never died despite the apparent victory of Mersenne and Bacon in the seventeenth century. In this essay I shall briefly describe the roots and the main characteristics of. this tradition, following closely Frances Yates' lucid and illuminating. treatment?, and the ways in which it still lives in biology, where it continues to challenge received dualist wisdom. Science, committed to unification and intelligibility, achieves its objectives in bizarre and historically tortuous ways. ",

        "text": "The Catalan philosopher and mystic, Ramon Lull (1232-1316) worked out a theory and practice of astral science and medicine which was based upon common components of the three dominant cultures of thirteenth-century Iberia - Moslem, Jewish and Christian. The common scientific principle was the theory of the elements (earth. air, fire, water) on which he based an astral science of correspondence between different levels of being -- terrestrial, celestial and super-celestial. These were linked by their possession of similar elementary properties, developed in the principle of correspondences such that the near and the far, and three levels of being, were united by virtue of sharing basic characteristics. However, Lull rejected the one-way determinism of astrology, for his system involved active participation by the practitioner of his art in mounting the ladder of creation to, potentially, the greatest heights of insight and knowledge. Here was an early articulation of what was later expressed in the Renaissance as the miracle of humanity, capable of prodigious development within the appropriate context of ethical and intellectual effort. The religious basis of the art was also common to the three religious traditions, namely the nine divine attributes or dignities of God: bonitas (goodness), magnitudo (greatness), eternitas (eternity), potestas (power), sapientia (wisdom), etc. To these Lull assigned letters, A being the ineffable absolute, while B to K (without J) signified the nine manifest qualities. Since God's attributes are manifest on all levels of creation, we have here another unifying principle which allowed the practitioner to ascend and descend with the letters of the art throughout the universe. Lull linked the elements, designated ABCD, to the letters of the attributes, suggesting a kind of algebra which was connected also to a symbolic geometry in the form of triangle, circle and square for each of the levels of being, from top (super-celestial) to bottom (terrestrial), respectively. These abstract symbols assist the artist in moving through the complex levels of being and organization which are to be explored and experienced through a contemplative method which owes much to the mystical traditions associated with the different religions, particularly Sufism (Moslem) and cabala (Jewish). What Lull created was a remarkable culturally synthetic art-science, a precursor of scientific method which had an immense influence in Europe for centuries. It was a major stimulus to the great radical, reforming movements of the Renaissance. ",

This was a synthetic product of ancient wisdom and modern insight which incorporated both hermetic and cabalistic teaching.

It takes the form of a conversation between a Pythagorean, Philolaus, a Moslem, Marranus, and a cabalist, Simon ben Elieser, who meet in an inn in Frankfurt.

The growth of Catholic power in Iberia in the fifteenth century led to a simpler form of religious unity than that envisioned by Lull, with the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and of the Moors in 1505. And Reuchlin was the focus of a fierce anti-Semitic attack in Germany because of his espousal of Jewish scholarship and cabalistic teaching as elements in his transformational system of knowledge and action. German humanists succeeded in turning this attack against the perpetrators by the publication of a brilliant satirical work,. Letters of the Obscure Men, and the wave of anti-Semitism subsided.. The forces of reaction and division had nevertheless made an ominous appearance, and the witch-hunts against those seeking transforming experiential insight, labelled black magic or illicit knowledge, broke. out repeatedly in the sixteenth century. Reuchlin was a reformer, seeking a mystical resolution of religious problems. Luther, his contemporary, sought a political solution. The fragmentation that followed Luther's attempts at reform in religion was matched by an equivalent fragmentation of scientific knowledge which followed upon the establishment by Mersenne and Bacon of science from which the astral linkings of Giorgi's universal harmony were banished, \\*cutting off at the roots the connection of the psyche with the cosmos'2.

After the fall, which started in the seventeenth century and was completed in the nineteenth only the pieces remained to baffle all the King's horses and all the King's men. What has emerged from twentieth century biology is that there are many more pieces than anyone ever dreamed of, and more are being discovered every day; rather like elementary particle physics, one might say, only more so. How are we to make sense of this molecular profusion, to construct an intelligible conceptual unity and so to understand organisms and their evolution? Following the traditional dualism of the mind-nature split, there is a strong tendency in biology to assume that organisms have an intelligent' controlling aspect and a passive, quasi-inanimate, controlled. aspect. The controlling part embodies the essential principles of the biological state; the capacity to reproduce, to keep the parts working in relation to one another, to evolve and to adapt. The organism is thus seen as a dualistic mechanism, like a computer with its intelligent' software (programme) and its passive hardware which responds to. instructions coded in the programme. And this is precisely the metaphor used in biology to explain the relationship between the DNA with its hereditary instructions, which are intelligently translated into proteins via the genetic code; and the organism which is made. out of these proteins and their products. This computer metaphor for. organismic structure and function has proved extremely useful in the. analysis of the relationships between the different types of macromolecule (DNA, RNA and protein) which are distinctive to organisms, and in describing changes of molecular state during embryonic development and evolution. This is the successful face of molecular biology, based upon ingenious techniques of molecular analysis, many of which exploit basic macromolecular processes distinctive to organisms themselves, such as immunological (antigen-antibody) reactions, DNA replication (gene cloning) and DNA-RNA interactions (hybridization). There is absolutely no doubt about the extraordinary analytical power of these techniques, and the value of descriptions arrived at in relation to understanding the detailed molecular processes involved in reproduction and in evolution. However, what remains very elusive is precisely what these techniques and the associated conceptual structure are unable to address directly; namely, the nature of the integrated spatial and temporal order that gives organisms their distinctive attributes, particularly their morphology and their behaviour.

Now, despite the deficiency of this answer relative to the way we have become accustomed to thinking about this process, the statement is none the less correct as far as it goes, for it says that one of the components determining the. trajectory of a body, namely its initial position and velocity (at some arbitrary point in the cycle if the motion is in a closed periodic orbit), must remain unchanged if the periodic orbit is to remain unchanged..

For example, one often finds statements to the effect that mutant genes \\*cause' particular types of change of form or morphology in organisms. An example is a homoeotic mutant called antennapaedia in the fruit fly, Drosophila, in which legs appear during the embryonic development of the fly where antennae would normally arise. However, this is cause in neither a specific nor a sufficient sense. It is not specific, because the effect of the mutant gene can be produced in normal (non-mutant) flies by a non-specific stimulus, such as a tran-. sient change in the temperature to which the embryo is exposed at a. particular time in its development; and it is not sufficient, because knowledge of the presence of the mutant gene is not enough to explain why the morphology changes as it does, just as a knowledge of last year's elliptical orbit is insufficient to explain elliptical planetary motion. A sufficient explanation requires a knowledge also of the way the mutant gene product acts upon the developmental process such. that a particular morphological change occurs in a particular part of the organism, i.e. it requires a sufficiently articulated theory of morphogenesis to identify those changes in particular parameters which result in one morphology (leg) rather than another (antenna). in a particular region of the organism. Such a theory must obviously be a field theory of some kind, since we are dealing with functions with space as one of the variables. Once such a field theory of reproduction and morphogenesis is articulated (and there are promising. developments in this direction4.5), the laws of organization of developmental processes will be embodied in the field equations in terms of the particular relational order in space and time that characterize developmental dynamics, and the organized context (the organism') within which genes and environmental stimuli act as partial causes of particular developmental trajectories will become evident. The spacetime organization of the morphogenetic field will then define some. constraint on the set of possible morphogenetic trajectories and transformations which are possible, just as Newton's equations define the set of trajectories which are possible for bodies acted upon by gravitational fields.

However, the particular metaphor that biologists have used to describe this process, namely that the reproductive process is directed by a programme 'written in the nucleic acid message'9, has tended to have two unfortunate consequences. First, it implies that genes and the information' they contain constitute specific, sufficient explanations of reproduction, in the sense that a computer programme explains the behaviour of a computer (i.e. knowledge of the programme is sufficient to explain the behaviour of the computer), so that biologists seek solutions to the problem of reproduction in terms of hierarchies of regulator or control genes, and the 'sub-routines' they control, i.e. in managerial, instructional and information-flow terms. This splits the organism into genotype (instructions) and phenotype (the form produced by the instructions). The second consequence is that this metaphor not only divides organisms into a dominant controlling part (a mind or a soul) and a subordinate controlled part (a body), as did Weismann in $1894^{10}$ , the originator of this dualism; it also makes it look as if biology is in some sense basically different from physics, being primarily a science of information processing and transmission rather than one characterized by particular types of organization of matter and distinctive fields of force.

The failure of molecular biology, the science of biological particles, to solve the problem of biological form and transformation (reproduction and taxonomy) is not simply due to a lack of sufficiently detailed molecular knowledge; it is a failure to conceptualize reproduction in appropriate terms. This requires a unitary treatment of the process in terms of the space-time dynamics of morphogenetic fields and their ordered transformations. These fields are made out of gene products, organized spatially in particular ways (cytoskeleton, membranes, extracellular matrix) and diffusing over domains defined. by permeability barriers, ion fluxes generating electrical currents, cells. and cell sheets and adhesive, viscous and elastic properties, and other characteristics which, when taken together, define space-time behaviour distinctive to the living state. The study of this state and its transformations may be described as either biology or physics. It can be divided for convenience in various ways, according to spatial or temporal dissections. But the revolution in molecular genetics of the 1970s and 1980s, which has demonstrated that there is no stable molecular organization (site of the instructions for the genetic programme) carrying invariant packets of information through the de-. velopmental process from fertilization of the egg to the adult organism, means that the genotype/phenotype dualism has broken down and been replaced by the concept of a fluid genome that participates dynamically, and equally, with the rest of the developmental process in the generation of the organism from the egg. And in general, the eggs of the next generation are not separated out from the dynamics of the developmental process, as Weismann described in his germ plasm concept (although some species do follow this strategy): rather, the gonads and their reproductive cells are generated as part of the same developmental process that the rest of the organism undergoes. There are no privileged parts; everything undergoes fux, flow and transformation, though it is all organized. And the continuity of the living state from generation to generation, via this organized dynamic, results in a view of evolution as also a field of flow and transformation subject to both internal and external perturbation. This image is consonant with Bohm's concept of undivided wholeness in flowing movement', which he proposes as the primary state from which entities may be considered to arise, like vortices in a stream. This image of flow, movement and transformation as the essence of the living state, with various forms or morphologies as transient expressions of an on-going process, was forcefully described by Goethe, who introduced. the term 'morphology' in the eighteenth century and gave an enormous stimulus to the study of living form. 'What has been formed is immediately transformed again, and if we would succeed, to some degree, to a living view of Nature, we must attempt to remain as active and as plastic as the example she sets for us.'11.

But there has been a less wellrecognised philosophical tradition which has concentrated on the. relations between things, and how these relations produce changes in things and in their relations. Thus Heraclitus in ancient Greece and, at about the same time, philosophers in China saw the essence of. reality in change and renewal. Opposition was the relation which produced change. Thus opposite principles such as yin and yang pervaded everything, and change came about by opposed things forming a unity. As Pan Ku said in the first century AD 'Things that oppose each other also complement each other.' In the West these ideas were kept alive by thinkers like Nicholas de Cusa (who saw God as the coincidence of opposites), Giordano Bruno, the mystic Jacob Boehme, and also the alchemists who saw in chemical reactions the union of opposites giving rise to new substances. These ideas were developed into a philosophical system by Hegel. He argued that if one thought about opposed concepts, for example being and notbeing, one was led to think of their unity in the concept of becoming. To define being one has to refer to not-being, and vice-versa; logically the two concepts are interdependent, inseparable and, in many respects, the same. But to say that being and not-being are the same is a contradiction. To avoid this, thought makes a leap and resolves the contradiction by thinking of the higher-order concept of becoming, which contains and unites both being and not-being. This type of argument - thesis, antithesis and then synthesis -- is reasonable. enough, but Hegel went further. As an idealist, he saw ideas as the primary reality which gave rise to all phenomena. He therefore extended the idea of the unity of opposites from the world of thought to all aspects of the natural world and of human life, especially history. Thinkers today are more doubtful about this extension, especially to the natural world; and the fact that Hegel was obscure adds to the uncertainties. In any case, I shall make use of a very simplified' view of Hegel. ",

Marx saw historical change arising. primarily from the opposition of social economic classes in society.. Thus it was historically inevitable that the opposition between the. capitalist and working classes would ultimately lead to the unity of a. classless society. Lenin emphasised that the transition from a state of. inherent continual opposition to the unity of opposites only took place under suitable conditions. Thus, under the right conditions, opposition ceased to be negative or destructive and, instead, gave rise to positive construction. This view gave a somewhat different emphasis to that of. Hegel, who seemed to imply that unity of opposites was achieved almost automatically by the movement of thought; he saw 'in contradiction the negativity which is the inherent pulsation of self-. movement and vitality'2. Lenin' emphasised that 'the most essential thing in Marxism [is] the concrete analysis of concrete situations' and. stressed the need for Marxists to study with great care and objectivity the particularities of the contradictions at each stage in a process of change.

Hegel considered all kinds of different \\*pairs of opposites' as being basically similar, e.g. pairs of concepts like being and not-being, geometrical opposites like left and right, the physical opposites of positive and negative electricity, opposed social classes in society, or the highly asymmetric pair of seed and soil which unite to give rise to a new plant. Is a similar principle of opposition or contradiction operating in these very different situations and giving rise to particular forms in the natural world (for example, as the opposition of symmetry and asymmetry in a crystal can give rise to forms like dislocations)? Or is one, as some philosophers imply6, merely playing with words when one uses terms like contradictions, conflict, antagonism, opposition and mutual exclusion in very different situations? ",

Before he met complementarity in physics, Bohr was, for example, interested in the complementary relation between the strictness of definition of a word and its practical usefulness. The meaning depends on context and can be defined more clearly if the context is limited; but, in limiting the context, the word loses some of its usefulness. In classical physics such limits do not exist; for example, the motion and position of a body can be measured independently of each other and, in theory, without limit to the accuracy. But when very small particles of matter such as electrons are studied, it is found that they behave differently from everyday bodies, such as billiard balls, which obey classical laws. It was found that an electron, depending on how it was observed, behaved either like a particle or, in another experiment, like a wave. It thus appeared that an electron had two, seemingly contradictory, natures which combined to form a complementary whole. The nature of this paradoxical whole can only be comprehended in terms of quantum mechanical theory. Roughly speaking, one could say in Hegelian terms that the opposite concepts of particle and wave have united to produce wave mechanics, though,. historically, wave mechanics did not arise simply from opposing the two concepts.

In contrast to the classical case, the measurement of the motion (or momentum) of an electron cannot be made independently of measuring its position. The two measurements are inextricably connected. This is a consequence of the fact that observing the electron alters its momentum. To try to see the exact position of an electron we shine light on it. But, in line with quantum mechanics, light behaves both like a train of waves and like particles which possess momentum. When the light meets the electron, it behaves like a particle and the collision alters the motion of the electron. To reduce this effect so that we can determine the momentum of the electron more exactly, we can use light of longer wavelength and less momentum, but the result is that the position is then seen less clearly. Depending on how we make the measurement, we can either measure position accurately and motion inaccurately, or position inaccurately and motion accurately; if we focus on one the other becomes blurred. In fact, if we measure motion very exactly, the electron appears to extend over all space; that is, it has no position. Thus momentum and position are mutually exclusive. This mutual exclusion is defined by Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, which expresses the fact that the total information in terms of momentum and position is limited. Bohr regarded the mutually exclusive momentum and position measurements as forming a complementary limited whole. Because momentum and position are mutually exclusive, we can regard them as opposites; but we cannot recognise in the complementary whole a set of relations other than mutual exclusion. ",

The same applies to the complementary relation of compassion and justice 10 which $\\cdot$ Bohr mentioned, and the relation of 'thoughts and sentiments' as presented by Bohr1o. However, this last example can be put into Hegelian terms. Bohr regarded thoughts and sentiments simply as mutually exclusive. Looking at this in more detail we see that thought is by no means autonomous; it requires sentiments, emotion or feeling tc motivate it and to help decide in what direction it goes. It would seem that thought and sentiments are never completely separable but are always to some extent interdependent -- even a series of deductive thoughts requires some motivation to keep it going, and sentiments are always associated with some kind of thought. The idea of mutual exclusion derives from the fact that strong emotions like anger obstruct clear thought, leaving only simple repetitive angry thoughts. And, vice versa, concentrated clear thought drives out all sentiment except cool quiet intellectual enthusiasm. Thus, like the momentum-position complementarity, the opposition of mutual exclusion does not seem capable of being transformed into a unity. However, Jung's ideas' about thought-feeling relations are different. According to Jung the state of mutual exclusion and opposition is not the optimum state, because thinking and feeling are then upsetting each other; for example, a neurotic person might find that thought was disturbed by the upsurging of uncontrollable emotions or, alternatively, intense intellectual activity could suppress all feeling and concern for others. Jung sees the optimum state of the mind as being a complementarity in which thinking and feeling interact constructively and form a unity. With such an optimum state of mind one could act with great energy, being both fired by strong feeling and guided by clear thinking; or one might react to a work of art by fusing incisive intellectual analysis with the strongest emotion. Probably, human limits will always leave us with some degree of mutual exclusion of thought and sentiment, but we can distinguish between a state of marked opposition and a state of partial co-. ordination and unity. By making such a distinction, Bohr's complementarity of thoughts and sentiment acquires a Hegelian form of unity of opposites. ",

Similarly, Rosenfeld attributes the view to Bohr that, when people hold seemingly irreconcilable points of view, the concept of complementarity can help them to get rid of prejudices which could foster intolerance. Rosenfeld also describes a discussion with Bohr about the guidance people sought in religion: 'Bohr declared with intense animation, that he saw the day when complementarity would be taught in the schools and become part of general education; and better than any religion, he added, a sense of complementarity would afford people the guidance they needed.' It would seem that Bohr had something in mind which he felt was very important and went beyond what he had written about ambiguity and limits to communication.

These groups join one chain to the other and are of four different kinds, each with a different shape and size. There is a complex sequence of these groups along each chain. This. sequence encodes the genetic message and constitutes the basic structure of the genes. But how can the DNA double helix, which is a tightly-packed structure, be very regular on the outside when the inside is irregular? This paradox was brilliantly resolved by the idea of Watson and Crick of the so-called complementary13 pairing (the complementarity being both geometrical and chemical). They discovered that the four different groups in DNA could be joined together to form two pairs which had the remarkable property that the exterior. dimensions of the pairs were exactly the same, and the positions of the chemical bonds at the ends of the pairs were exactly equivalent. As a result, if the two chains were joined by the pairs, the outer parts. of the chains would be exactly regular and independent of the sequence of groups along the inside. The exact geometrical and chemical relations in the pairs enabled the two parts of DNA to come together to form a well-defined whole. Since different groups are in special relation in this well-defined structure or whole, we may properly describe it as complementary. In Hegelian terms we could say that the opposites of regularity and irregularity have formed a unity, this unity involving a special, specific relation of the opposites. Recently, other relations of regularity and irregularity have been found in DNA. For example, the double helix is not rigid; it can stretch, compress, bend and twist. It is possible that this flexibility of the double helix may take special forms which are related to its functioning. It has also been found that the irregular sequence of groups inside the double helix produces slight irregularities on the outside.. These are not so great that they hinder the processes which depend on the outside being regular, but they seem to provide a guide to protein molecules which need to find particular sequences of groups inside the double helix.

Breaks are produced in the DNA chain and whole sections of chain containing large numbers of chemical groups are removed bodily and reinserted in a new position in the chain.

Thus a crystal exists in a symmetric form, but can it grow symmetrically? In the best known way that. crystals grow, the answer is no. A crystal grows by molecules attaching. themselves to its surface. But the attachment of a molecule to a flat surface is less strong than the attachment to an indentation or crevice. which can partly surround the molecule. Such an indentation exists at the edge of a single layer of molecules which spreads as the molecules deposit on the flat crystal surface. Thus we can understand why. crystals grow by deposition of molecules at the edge of such layers; but such growth would stop as soon as the layer covered the whole face of the crystal. However, if there is a local break in the regular structure of the crystal, distortion in the crystal can be such that the growing edge of the layer can gradually rotate, thus building up a continuous spiral succession of layers. Apparently the energy loss produced by the break in symmetry is outweighed by the gain in attachment energy at the edge of the layer. ",

Where there is irregularity in a crystal, the symmetry and asymmetry do not just 'add together' or oppose each other in an unorganised way. Energy. requirements cause special new structural forms to develop; for instance, special types of dislocation or disinclination which retain some regularity but also have specifically related breaks in regularity. This is an example of Hegelian interaction of opposites which give rise to new higher-order forms. Schrodinger knew that the coming together. of symmetry and asymmetry in a crystal could give rise to special new phenomena. I have wondered whether this was why he suggested that genes were aperiodic crystals, but probably this is not so because he. also likened the gene to a very large molecule, and he may have used the term crystal merely to express the stability of the structure.

This is economical in that a large structure may be built using only the relatively small amount of genetic information required to define the few types of protein. However, the sub-units need to be very cleverly designed if they are to fit together to build a unique structure, unless that structure is very simple. Providing the structure is symmetrical, the assembly of the whole structure can proceed automatically by a process which is essentially the same as crystallisation. As is the case with crystals, symmetry aids assembly and provides stability. Spherical virus particles are a simple example; they may contain only one type of protein. This forms a spherical shell which surrounds and protects the nucleic acid (like DNA) which carries the genetic message which codes for the virus protein. In such simple cases the form of the whole is determined by the properties of the parts. Tubular shells formed from a helical array of identical sub-units are also common, tobacco mosaic virus studied by Klug and Butler'4 being an interesting example. In this case, assembly proceeds in ordered steps separated by a break in symmetry. First the protein sub-units crystallise to form discs - circular, flat, symmetrical assemblies of thirty-two sub-units. Next the nucleic acid interacts with the discs; it does not interact with unassembled protein. The nucleic acid interaction causes the individual protein molecules in the disc to change their shape so that the circular flat assembly is no longer stable; it breaks, changes its symmetry and curls up into a short segment of helix. Then other discs interact with the nucleic acid and the resulting helical segments join together to build up the completely helical assembly. The length of the whole assembly is limited by the length of the nucleic acid molecule which fits inside it. An advantage of this rather complex mode of assembly is that the nucleic acid does not have to be added separately to the assembly and the protein shell cannot be assembled completely without the nucleic acid being in it. Also, assembly should be faster if preassembled protein discs are used instead of single protein molecules. It is important to note that the breaking of symmetry during assembly is not random; it gives rise to a specific dislocation at a particular stage in assembly. It seems proper, therefore, to describe the relation of regularity and irregularity as a complementarity. We may note that the change of symmetry results from the individual molecules undergoing a structural or conformational change which, in similar cases, is often an abrupt change from one well-defined conformation to another.

At first all these proteins may float about separately in solution. Then, in the first step of assembly, one type of protein aggregates to form one part of the virus, e.g. a disc, tube or shell. When this assembly is completed, the constituent protein molecules become able to bind to a second type of protein. By analogy with the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus, it would appear that the molecules which aggregate undergo a change in structure when the assembly is completed, this change being switched on by the completion of the assembly. The second protein cannot assemble or bind to the first protein until the first protein has completed its own assembly process. We get, therefore, an ordered sequence of assembly steps. This sequence is self-generating. In the same way, the main parts of the virus, such as head and tail, cannot join together until the assembly of both head and tail is complete.

In music and dance the powerful, even hypnotic, effect of regular beat is related to bodily rhythm - heart-beat, breathing and walking. The breaking of the regularity, the unexpected and surprising element, has a further higher-level impact and introduces a more complex level of expression, syncopation of rhythm being a simple example. It is the same with harmony and discord, and also with the building up of a theme and. breaking or modifying it. The basic rhythm, harmony or theme is a reference system which is an essential part of the higher structure;. and, therefore, the breaking of symmetry must not go so far that one loses contact with the reference system. In the same way children enjoy. playing games which scare, but the scare must not go too far. It is important to note that music will not result from mere mixture or addition of regularity and irregularity. The composer needs to create a meaningful combination of both; in fact, a complementarity. Then, quoting Arnold Schoenberg, 'Dissonances are only the remote consonances.'15 ",

Soldiers marching, e.g. slowly at a funeral or goosestepping aggressively, have a strong effect on those who watch them. The marching together gives the soldiers a feeling of comradeship and, of course, an obedient uncritical mechanical attitude of mind. The strong effect of the marching derives from the complementary relation of the machine-like aspect of the body and its opposite, the unique nature of an individual. Similarly, the impact of a chorus line of dancers is strengthened when one can recognise dancers as individuals. The inhuman/human complementarity is also, presumably, the basis of fascination with automata and puppets, and the strong and strange effect of masks in theatre and ballet. The coming together of the mechanical and non-mechanical evidently gives rise to new qualities. ",

Recent studies by psychologists of creativity often refer to dualities of some kind being involved in creativity, and sometimes these are complementarities, for example the duality of convergent and divergent thinking.

Henri Bergson believed that the mental function which complemented the intellect was intuition, which could provide knowledge by direct immediate perception independent of reasoning. Intuition, somewhat. instinctive and empathic, gave a broad, rather unspecific, overall impression or feeling which would then be refined and articulated by the intellect. This idea is supported by Einstein's impression that he was guided by his \\*nose' (like an animal)18, and that he became aware of a solution to a scientific problem at first in the form of visual or muscular images'9 which he then had to transform into mathematics.. Many scientists seem, like Einstein, to be guided by hunches. But others have found that, following much careful study, a clear idea suddenly appears in the mind. It would seem then that two levels of the mind interact. A thought which moves in the unconscious mind passes into the upper levels, which Freud called the preconscious, and then into consciousness2o. There it has to be selected and recognised. by conscious thought. When that has been done, a flash of insight is completed. Probably there is no unique pathway for creativity; it may. differ from person to person. Jung believed that, in the creative fantasy of the artist, intuition was not necessarily dominant4 and that the fantasy could partake of any of the four basic mental functions that he recognised. But, whether it is in science or art, the creative person must make the most careful, thorough and intent study of the world, becoming immersed in it empathically and yet keeping some objective detachment.

This inability to escape and to explore other possibilities may be due to the very existence of the pattern not being recognised (does a goldfish recognise the existence of the walls of the bowl which confine it?), or it may be due to inability to question the correctness of the pattern because it is seen, not as thought, but as reality itself. Psychic regression from cortical activity may provide a way to escape from domination by such patterns. Thus, some psychologists see free reversible regression as important in the creative process. But such regression may alarm the subject because the intellect is no longer in control and there may be a feeling that, like a psychotic, he is losing touch with reality, whereas in fact he may be moving closer to reality. Thus the subject may retreat from creativity. Frank Barron21. noted that creative writers are friendly to the unconscious'.

This is a false separation because, as Spinoza emphasised, we cannot, in the wider sense and longer term, separate the interests of ourselves from those of others.

Thus we should love ourselves as we should love others or, in a more limited form, we should treat others as we would have them treat us. This is in recognition of the fact that we and our opponent have the same basic psychology, share the same joys and sorrows and the same fundamental human needs. It will not help therefore to resolve the conflict if, instead of being self-centred, we direct attention away from our own needs and towards those of our opponent.

Such attitudes are the result of mechanical thinking. We see the world as being like a giant mechanism of parts which interact but remain fixed in nature.

Thus creative potential may arise from the transformation of destructive potential. But how are we to survive as the destructive potential of science-based weapons comes nearer to being enough to destroy all life on earth? The Russell-Einstein manifesto said that to avoid nuclear doom humanity needed a 'new kind of thinking'. In facing this gigantic and horrific challenge let us have courage. If we have the courage to make creative dialogue between East and West, we may then achieve a 'new kind of thinking'. ",

Plato's doctrine that ideal a priori forms are the true reality, which the manifest things of the world but imperfectly realize, reflects this technology. The clock was a defining technology. for pre-twentieth century physics. Thus Laplace conceived of the. entire universe as a mechanistic clockwork following completely deterministic Newtonian laws. Descartes thought of animals and La. Mettrie included man as clock-like.

I say new because it departs radically from the views I held as someone brought up in the psychoanalytic tradition. To mention one such radical departure, to which I will come back later, I no longer look upon dreaming primarily as an individual matter. Rather, I see it as an adaptation concerned with the survival of the species and only secondarily with the individual. I refer to this as the speciesconnectedness aspect of dreaming. In this presentation I will try to relate two aspects of Bohm's thought to dreaming; namely, the notion of unbroken wholeness and his concept of the implicate order. ",

I am referring to the aesthetic-creative approach to knowledge which is probably older than our strivings for mastery. It seeks to create and maintain meaningful contact between men. It helps man to transcend himself and experience himself as part of a larger whole. In the formulations of Andras Angyal' it serves man's homonomous need, the need to connect with a larger supporting environment, just as the mastery over objects serves his autonomous need, the need to maintain one's own boundaries. In its manifestations it is immediate, sensuous, ineffable and infinite. It is the wave counterpart to the particulate notions of science. It serves man's need for unity, togetherness and harmony. When scientific knowledge is developed in a one-sided way. it results in the separation of subject and object and becomes divisive in character. When the creative-aesthetic way of knowing is misapplied it results at best in the cult of an aesthetic elite, at worst in impractical arrangements. Regardless of which mode is used, a poor fit between the mode of knowing and the context to which it is applied will result in misfiring and unintended consequences.

Eschewing the theoretical and technical strategies of formal therapy, its sole purpose is to help the dreamer appreciate, to the extent of his own readiness and desire, all that the images can convey about the current emotional context of his life. The members of the group are oriented to meeting the two basic needs of the dreamer. The first need is to feel safe. In order to feel free to share the dream with others and to engage in the self-disclosure necessary, an atmosphere of trust and safety has to be generated. This is brought about in a number of ways. The control of the process lies completely in the hands of the dreamer. No one in the group assumes the role of the therapist and the dreamer is the final authority as to what in the dream fits into the context of his life. The process respects the dreamer's privacy as well as his individuality. There is no imposition of any a priori system of symbolic meanings so that there is respect for the dreamer's ability to use any image in highly idiosyncratic ways. Trust is further generated by the sharing that goes on at several different levels. In the course of ongoing dream work everyone, including the leader, has the option of sharing a dream and, in due course, everyone becomes known to each other at this deeper level of communication.

Then, working with the context thus elicited, they help the dreamer build further bridges between the images in the dream and his life situation. The questions are put in an open-ended way that leaves the dreamer free to deal with them in any manner he chooses. The dreamer is helped to contextualize the dream, i.e. to relate the imagery to those aspects of his life and personality that they metaphorically point to.

As a result of these fixations in consciousness, relationships between human beings don't seem to unfold or enfold in the manner that Bohm's ideas of the implicate order imply. Instead these points become like rocks around which the stream of life moves. By definition these fixations are part of the explicate as well as the implicate order.

But the second factor is that we have developed the capacity to extinguish our species and perhaps the planet itself. This makes our conflict more ominous and spurs us on to try to understand how conflict happens and how we can find more adequate solutions. to our situation.

Clearly he assumed that he was, in fact, that brilliant person who could write a perfect first draft because otherwise he would not have been humiliated by the difficulties of the writing. He was not interested in learning different ways of working on his writing. Nor was he interested to know why he did not communicate with his audiences. When he received a rejection of a manuscript he railed at the editors because they could not understand that his work was profound. He focussed on the limitations of the editors and what he was entitled to from them. ",

When he saw the smoke from the incense stick and felt the evanescence of life, he felt very lonely.

And at the moment of enlightenment he exclaimed, 'There is no body and no mind!' When he said \\*no body and no mind,' all his being in that moment became a flashing into the vast phenomenal world, a flashing which included everything, which covered everything, and which had immense quality in it; all the phenomenal world was included within it, an absolute independent existence. That was his enlightenment. Starting from the lonely feeling of the evanescence of life, he. attained the powerful experience of the quality of his being. He said 'I have dropped off mind and body.' Because you think you have body or mind, you have lonely feelings, but when you realize that everything is just a flashing into the vast universe, you become very strong, and your existence becomes very meaningful.

He somehow knew better about the way. in which all of our perspectives were generated and connected to our common generativity. At that moment the dialogue fell into a flowing discussion in which there was a juxtaposition of different views. Each individual could see that his ideas were but one perspective on the whole of any process. Each person knew that his perceptual activity was the movement which made a reality at every moment. We shared images, feelings and other not-quite-formed views and, as we tossed. around some of the different ramifications of these images and feelings, new connections and references came forth.

Certainly throughout our universe these relatively fixed points are in interactions that allow for dissolution and transformation from focus to focus.

I remember that during our radio show he said he thought scientific theories should be presented like poetry because, like poems, theories are insights, acts of perception, rather than hard and fast conclusions. In presenting his implicate order, Bohm is always careful to spell out the suggestive rather than objective value of his illustrating metaphors like the hologram or the glycerine ink-drop experiment. He is always pointing beyond, showing where his theory, vast as it is, must shade off into more subtle reaches and regions of the unknown (the super-implicate order, higher-dimensional realities, chaos as infinite degrees of order, the super-quantum potential and the super-super-quantum potential), always impressing the listener with the limitations of the mind in the face of this vast order of which the mind itself is a mirror. In this way,. Bohm tries to avoid the common fate of scientific metaphors and accomplish something very like what happens in the. $X/Y$ dynamics of metaphors in poems. But Bohm's understanding is rare. The very richness of an envisioning metaphor is usually its downfall. Greedy for certainty, the mind can't resist and seeks to draw out every last ounce of the treasure until the metaphor collapses. Poetic metaphor avoids this exploitation and eventual exhaustion (though not for the lack of critics' trying) because of its. $X/Y$ dynamics and because the. metaphor is set in a subtle structure of other metaphor-like devices which engender a pervasive order.

In a peculiar and often quite indirect way, the inspiration for the creation and the thing created began to mirror each other. The initial perception is that some one element - idea, memory, melody - contained. the whole, and, in the end, the creator produces a form in which each unique element reflects the whole of the piece.

In the consciousness of human beings appreciation of this dynamic is obscured by our tendency to view things as either similar or different and to introduce causality to explain away the fact that everything is similar and different simultaneously.

Should our scientific explanations of natural phenomena have a comparison/ contrast dynamic between implicate and explicate; between analysis and what lies beyond analysis?

If we think of the dynamics of the establishment of form, it requires some sort of end in view, so the formal and final cause must go together. This is also the basic essence of Rupert Sheldrake's idea of the formative cause [ed. in Sheldrake's A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of. Formative Causationl.

Also, it encourages us much more toward a creative attitude, and fundamentally it opens the way to the transformation of the human being because a change of meaning is a change of being. At present we say because of the confused fragmentary meanings we have a confused fragmentary being, both individually and socially. Therefore this opens the way to a whole being, in society and in the individual.   \nWeber It also seems to bring in ethical responsibility, because if. we are, or can be partners in, helping to transform being through our. meanings, wouldn't that imply that what we think and feel counts? Bohm It counts. When you say responsibility, the key word is response. Nobody can be responsible who is unable to respond. If you ask somebody who is unable to respond to be responsible, you have not responsibility, but probably guilt. As long as the meaning is confused, nobody can respond to all this. His response is going to be very limited and therefore that responsibility is very limited.   \nWeber To relate it to human psychology and transformation, the key seems to be the Socratic maxim 'Know yourself,' go inward, and also 'Observe.'   \nBohm And also outward.

The being of matter is its meaning; the being of ourselves is meaning; the being of society is its meaning. The mechanistic view has created a rather crude and gross meaning which has created a crude and gross and confused society.   \nWeber This view, your view, would make human beings feel rooted and have their dynamic place in the whole scheme of things.   \nBohm At least they would have a chance to find it there. It's a view within which it makes sense to observe to find out where your place is. ",

            Preface  Why did I decide to write this book? It is easy to present the latest scientific discoveries in physics and astronomy, and teaching or popularizing science is certainly fun. Science, when a certain assertion is demonstrated, makes everyone feel safe and this is one of its merits. Science is like a crystal bubble where all is clear and predictable. But what of that which is out of the bubble? It seems that science should ignore it—or deliver it to religion, spirituality or metaphysics. Is such aptitude scientific? Apparently it is, as phenomena that cannot be described as a function of space and time, and that cannot be reproducible at will, cannot be addressed by science. And yet many persons feel, or know, that such phenomena exist. A few scientists, although totally maintaining their faith in their Galilean method, think it would be important to explore what lies beyond the visible horizon. Such an objective is not evasion but rather the desire to explain in rational terms what we think it is unexplainable. We humans live in a causal reality—surf the waves of space and time. But sometimes and suddenly our brain, a physical entity, awakens us to "other realities", as we perceive them: to phenomena coming from no space and no time that manifest in the space and time of our brain and produce sensations of a greater reality. Why should science ignore this? Our everyday life, especially in this epoch, shows that, despite the certainties of science, something seems missing. That "something" has to do with our subjective reality, which affects our life both individually and collectively. On a larger scale, it also affects interactions inside our society. We know that our consciousness has a direct effect on the external reality that surrounds us by inducing events occurring in space and time. We cannot reduce such an important fact to a mere matter of "faith". There must be an explanation for this, which the exploratory side of science can no longer ignore. Science explains aspects of external reality convincingly. None doubt this. But we do not yet know what we truly are. We wish to live as intensely as possible and, at the same time, are afraid of death. Can our ability to explain things go beyond the bubble we have built around us? Or will we simply compensate for this lack of knowledge by plunging uncritically into religion, the New Age or individual contemplation? I believe that Science (true science, not accountancy) will soon be able to explain what now appears impossible. This book could not have been written decades ago. But today it can—as emerging scientific insights show the tip of an iceberg previously unseen, leaving us no other choice than to investigate what's under that tip. That's why I believe that this speculative book—which is certainly not intended at all as a "revelation"—has a reason to exist. A fire smoulders under ashes and I hope to blow on it until it flares.  4

            Introduction  Standard science has established that matter/energy and mind/consciousness are separate entities. Cartesius called them respectively "res extensa" and "res cogitans". The present scientific paradigm, that started with Galileo and Newton four centuries ago, assumes that this separation is the basis of the experimental and mathematical method of science, and of the logical reasoning of philosophy. Certainly, positivism, with its rigor and criteria of repeatability, has produced irrefutable results in all fields of science and technology. For example, classical and non- classical physics (such as relativity and quantum theories) have been able to offer us an objective picture of reality, even if the quantum world has taught to us that determinism is no longer valid in the realm of elementary particles. Despite this, a mathematical description provides a sure scientific method, even when experimental proofs are lacking. The Universe is written in mathematical language reflecting a system of laws, or structure of order, inside the reality around us. And the function of a scientist is to reveal, in an explicit and quantitative way, what Nature has constructed. So, are science and reality ontologically the same thing? We agree that science provides a useful, highly logical, map of reality. But we cannot be sure that it represents the entire territory—if recurring anomalies are totally ignored. If science continues to ignore such incongruities, it will no longer be scientific enough and will become a dogma not so different from religion. Unfortunately many scientists are all too willing to accept their own canon. This may be valid when applied to the scientific method, which no one can question, but erroneous when applied to scientific   knowledge . Except for some totally established facts, such as classical mechanics, electrodynamics and atomic physics, other scientific theories, for instance, the Big Bang theory and the Standard Model for elementary particles, still wait for full confirmation. In fact, there are different theories, equally rigorous, well able to explain the same facts. For instance, the stationary state theory, superstring theory and quantum loop gravity. The former standard theories for cosmology and structure of matter are certainly convincing—in particular the Standard Model—because they offer many observational and experimental evidences. But, although their elegance and quantitative value is obvious from a mathematical point of view, much incompleteness remains. Examples: We do not yet know if magnetic monopoles and mini-black holes exist. We do not know exactly what is the true component of dark matter. We are not totally sure that the neutrino has mass. We do not know if electrons and quarks contain something else inside. We do not know if particles are point-like objects or infinitely long strings. And, in spite of encouraging results recently obtained, we are not totally sure that the Higgs boson is really a field that confers mass to all the particles. Science and physics (including astronomy) proceed by logical tiny and cautious steps and produce numbers coming from laws that we are able to deduce from observing reality. These laws are exact—because formalized only by mathematics. But are they really the territory—or simply a logical map of what we   think   reality is? Our knowledge is epistemological but not yet ontological. Why? Because, as scientists, we behave as external impartial observers and not as the components of this reality as we live it. In other words, we describe reality as if we are not living inside it. So what should we do in order to describe reality better? What kind of scientific knowledge might evolve if we cease just observing things aseptically? Certainly, the best way to be rational, as science demands, is to remain objective—not to identify with what we   live —not to mix our rational approach with an emotional one.  5

            However, reality is not confined to rationality. It also involves emotions and spirituality. There is far more to Life than the rational mind. Certainly, rational thinking helps us describe and understand our surroundings, including our body as a physical entity independent from our person. But emotions and spirituality are the way we   live   the reality we describe, even if not a functional method to understand physical reality itself. Yet they are reality as well—our own reality and the reality of human interaction. Why shouldn't we attempt to describe our emotions scientifically, too? The true Universe is not only made only of atoms, stones, stars and animals but also of sentient and spiritual beings. And true reality is a continuous interaction between a boundless landscape made of objects and the subjects populating it, who in their turn interact together. Therefore reality is a much more complex entity than the one science normally describes. We know much of that landscape, but know nothing (in exact scientific terms) of what we truly are. You may argue that Psychology and other human sciences describe the interiority of persons. But this kind of theorization seems somewhat empiric, qualitative or speculative in its models. It often borders on religion and can be irrational as well. It lacks the exactitude with which science is able to describe external reality. Human behavior is unpredictable and our ignorance of what we are is clearly a major problem for society. As the emotions of a single person or of a group of persons interacting together are explicated inside a very specific physical landscape and not out of it, one wonders if wider physical laws are able to describe reality in its totality using the method of exact sciences—as physics, for instance, can. Yet we seem to accept, from the scientific and technological results of the last 100 years, that our entire society is entirely ruled by "objective facts" and that everything outside this limitation is irrelevant. However, the world is affected by a deluge of emotions of which we know scientifically only a little, apart from their biochemistry. Consider our dreams—not objective facts but still part of our reality when we sleep, and sometimes also when we are awake. The totality of a human being is made of the physical, of the intellect, of emotions and of dreams. Is science able to describe all this? Currently it is—but partially. So, we have a scientific map of how we are constructed but not yet an ontological description of what we are—that is, our true territory, which is boundless. A "total science" should be able to furnish a description—able to include both the physical and consciousness. In this book I will amply discuss the possibility of describing consciousness and related topics scientifically. Subsequently I will focus the attention on a new hypothesis which describes the possibility that our consciousness is connected to a "cosmic data bank" from which it is possible to "download" information and at the same time to "upload" our own "data". It will be seen in the following reasoning that this new model of reality can explain several other phenomena, which appear to be connected. Of course nothing of what will be said can yet be demonstrated scientifically, as, except for some established aspects, it is mostly a sort of logical speculation. Such a speculation is intended to be a stimulus by posing several questions that science—physics in particular— hasn't yet solved. Science was not designed as a mere management of data or to perfect what we already know, but rather as an exploration process. Only exploration can make science evolve, because the goal of science is to acquire knowledge, which can be gained only after some crucial and even controversial problems are fully understood in scientific terms. The first step towards this process is to dare to venture a hypotheses, even the most apparently courageous. Some of such hypotheses may eventually be unnecessary (this can be understood only by reasoning), but others may trigger new knowledge.  6

            The goal of this book is to create a stimulus both to my colleagues and to others who have the patience to read it thoroughly. Here is no intent to present alleged "truths". There is nothing to reveal but a series of hypotheses and fundamental questions which might lead to a better and understanding of the reality in which we live—assuming that what we call "mind" and "matter" are two interpenetrating and continuously interacting entities. The intent is not to promote a philosophy or metaphysics but a physical science. The book has two main parts. The first deals with the spookiest findings of quantum physics in elementary particles—with Bohm's interpretation of quantum entanglement and his new cosmology where matter and mind are united into a single entity through what he calls "quantum potential", and with the most relevant theories about the possible existence of a "biofield" and the quantum nature of consciousness and of synchronicity. The second part—the longest—deals with: 1) my theory about the possible existence of a cosmic "Big Library" (BLH—Big Library Hypothesis) able to link all living beings in the Universe using non-local processes through which information is vectored and triggering creation of new matter through the action of a hypothesized "supernal intelligence". 2) other related topics involving the role of the "spirit" intended as a physical and non- religious concept and the possibility that the spirit may occupy after death bodies of non- biological nature, and finally the search for extraterrestrial intelligence using non-local methods. As—except for the first part—it is based on several quite courageous hypotheses, this cannot be considered a science book but rather a "science-fiction" text from which, one day, true science might be born. As explained, I am attempting here to blow on the fire under the ash. This text is a trigger directed in particular to my most unprejudiced and open minded scientist colleagues. After all, every means is good that leads to a concrete result. The science expected to evolve from this is rational, but not the close minded "rationality" of the ostrich.  7

            Chapter 1: The weird world of quantum physics  Unlike standard Newtonian/Einsteinian physics, the realm described by quantum physics is  not deterministic but probabilistic. In the world of elementary particles, the observer, using  measurement instrumentation, inevitably affects the observed reality. According to the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle it is not possible to determine the trajectory of an  elementary particle like the electron, since it is not possible to know simultaneously at each  instant its position and its speed. If we improve the knowledge of position, i.e. locating the  particle as a point-like particle, reducing the uncertainty about its position, we increase  uncertainty on the speed. Similarly, it is impossible to determine at the same time the  material component (photon) and the energetic component (wave) of a given quantum  event. The energy has simultaneously the properties of both a wave and a particle.  This concept can be described in simple terms as:  2  p x   h  ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥  ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆  This means that if one improves the knowledge of the position   x , i.e. locating the  particle as a point-like particle, reducing the uncertainty  ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ x   about its position one increases  the uncertainty  ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ p   on the Impulse   p = m  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ v   (i.e. the speed   v ).  Similarly, it is impossible to determine at the same time the material component  (photon) and the energetic component (wave) of a given quantum event. The energy has  simultaneously the properties of both a wave and a particle.  Therefore, unlike the trajectory of a planet in its orbit following well defined and  predictable Newtonian mechanics, the trajectory of an electron can only be predicted using  probabilistic techniques, not deterministic.  A quantum system is represented by a "wave function", which is one of the basic terms  of the Schrödinger Equation, which determines how this function evolves over time.  Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ   V  m 2 t  i   2 2  − − − − ∇ ∇ ∇ ∇ = = = =  ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂  ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂   h h  Where,   i   is an imaginary number,   m   is the electron mass  ψ ψ ψ ψ   (r, t) is the wave function,  V   (r) is the potential energy at position r,   r   is space,   t   is time and  ∇ ∇ ∇ ∇   is the Laplace operator  given by:  2 2 2 2 2 2 2  z y x   ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ + + + + ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ + + + + ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ = = = = ∇ ∇ ∇ ∇  The wave function cannot be used to precisely locate the exact coordinates of the  elementary particle (such as an electron) but rather to define a volume of space within  which the electron may be found with higher probability. Such volume of space is  technically represented by an "orbital". As soon as one makes a measurement, the particle is  found only in a given place, but between a measurement and the other the particle dissolves  into a "superposition of probability waves" and it is potentially present in many different  places simultaneously within a given orbital. When the measurement (i.e.: the act of  observation) is made, this wave packet "collapses" instantly, again into a localized particle:  this represents the so called "wave function collapse".  This simply means that the wave function is like a soap bubble that hides inside something that we cannot see. The wave function is like the surface of the bubble—and when we pierce it using a needle it disappears leaving just a water drop. As soon as we observe a elementary particle such as an electron we suddenly turn the soap bubble (wave  8

        <section id="page-9">
            function) into a water drop (the electron found with only one sign of its spin). This is what  happens when the wave function collapses.   All this means is that, in the world of elementary  particles, the observer inexorably affects that which is observed.  These concepts can be intuitively explained using an example: the "Schrödinger's Cat  Paradox". Imagine that we enclose a cat in a box. Then suppose that a photon enters the box  with half a chance of being transmitted, and another half of not being transmitted. If the  photon is transmitted, it triggers a device emitting a chemical that kills the cat, but if it is  not transmitted the cat remains alive. However, since the cat is inside the box, we cannot  know whether it is alive or dead. In fact, there is a superposition of states in which the cat is  both alive and dead.  This example represents intuitively the concept of "superposition" of quantum states, as  described by the wave function. We will know if the cat is alive or dead, at the very moment  when we open the box. The act of opening the box is exactly equivalent to the process of  measurement and corresponds to the collapse of the wave function.  We can use one more example to explain the same concept: the "Coin Paradox". If we  are inside a dark room and throw a coin in the air and it falls on the ground, we cannot  know if it shows head or tails, because the coin is in a "superposition of head and tails,"  until we turn on the light. When we turn on the light we make the superposition of head and  tails "collapse", because we are finally able to see which of the two sides of the coin is  shown.  The act of measuring something destroys the superposition, forcing the quantum state  described by the wave function to achieve a "classical state" in which the identity of the  various states is determined. All this happens in the world of elementary particles, and the  perturbative role of the observer is critical, as he inexorably interacts with a quantum reality  made of a superposition of states, inciting them to take on one well-defined state.  The laws of standard Newtonian physics describing rigorously and precisely the world around us—from the objects of everyday reality to the behavior of celestial dies—provide an insuperable limit: the speed of light— which, according to the findings of relativity theory, cannot exceed 300,000 kilometers per second. This means that the photons of light and any other electromagnetic radiation employ time to cover a space. These times are reduced to a fraction of a second and a half to travel the Earth-Moon distance but become four years to travel the distance between the Earth and the nearest star. In this way the known universe— the size of which is at least 14 billion light-years—cannot have a simultaneous perception of itself and any communication between the component parts is possible only in times that are immeasurably long.  But when we enter the size of the infinitely small—that of electrons and quarks—in particular circumstances completely different physical mechanisms occur. Both through theoretical and mathematical arguments and through lab experimentation it has been possible to demonstrate that if two particles—such as two electrons—have interacted with each other at least once, when they are separated even at great distances from each other a spooky phenomenon results. Let's consider the concept first from the point of view of a famous thought experiment which gave rise to the so called "EPR Effect" (EPR: from the name initials of physicists Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen). The concept behind this paradox is that if one takes an elementary particle with no spin ( the spin is the characteristic quantized rotation of elementary particles ), and splits it into two parts it happens that one has to have a spin +1/2 and the other a spin —1/2. This is inevitable in order to ensure the law of conservation of spin—which must have a zero sum—when the two halves become again a single particle with spin +1/2-1/2 = 0. If it is assumed that each of these particles is sent to  9
            <div class="page-number">Page 9 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-10">
            opposite directions to reach great distances, it is expected that the total spin remains zero and it must be so in order that the law of spin conservation is respected. Lets, at this point, agree to invert the sign of the spin of one of the two particles, which can be done simply by observing it. How would the other particle react? To ensure the law of spin conservation, that particle is obliged to change instantaneously the sign of its spin. Due to this, the spins are said to be "correlated" (see Fig. 1). And here is the paradox— because it violates the principle of causality. Now let's consider the concept from a purely experimental point of view. If an observer uses an electron microscope to observe the particle that remained in the laboratory, this action, based on the emission of photons to illuminate it, inevitably alters the quantum state of the particle. The perturbation induced by the observer causes the reversal of the sign of the "spin" of the particle, i.e. the direction of its rotation. In this way, when we enter the world of the infinitely small, the observer perturbs the observed reality by modifying it, and so what we see of this micro-universe is only the result of our interaction with it. We just talked about the first particle, the one that has remained in our laboratory, and which we observe using our experimental apparatus by perturbing its spin. While we do this to the first particle, we now must ask what happens to the twin particle, which is, for example, one light-year away from the first particle. The answer is that, in the same exact instant in which the particle located in the laboratory is observed using the instrument, the twin particle in turn will reverse the sign of its spin in a perfectly synchronized way with the first particle, i.e. in zero time. If this does not happen then the law of spin conservation will be violated. The famous "double slit experiment" shows the same spooky synchronism, but in this specific case we deal with a single particle—a photon—that splits into two parts. This is what happens. Let's imagine sending a beam of light and passing it through a double slit. If we pass the beam through both slits, light behaves as a wave, generating an interference pattern on the wall, made of clear fringes and dark fringes depending on whether the interference is constructive or destructive. If, instead, we close one of the slits, the light behaves like particles, in the form of photons impacting any point of the screen. The oddity here is in the change of the behavior of light when we change the conditions: this is a consequence of quantum theory. This is nothing new compared to what has been said so far. The truly important fact is another one. What happens if instead of a beam of photons we send a single photon one after another and not at the same time? It happens that every single photon passes through both slits simultaneously, and then creates the interference fringes interfering with nothing else but with itself. And the interference fringes that were born from a single photon are absolutely simultaneous. In essence, the photon interacts with itself simply being in two places simultaneously to the point of creating the interference. It is as if the photon "knows" the points and the exact times when it must be split in order to give rise to interference fringes. It is as if I tossed a tennis ball against the wall of a house having two windows, and the ball passes simultaneously through both windows! This event collides violently with everything we think we know about reality, since the fact that a single particle can be in two different places simultaneously shatters the principle of causality to replace it with one of synchronicity. In the specific case of the double-slit they are the doublings of a single photon to be intertwined in both space and in time, and the intimate structure of quantum mechanics tells us that the photon reaches precise positions behind the slits because it is literally informed in a non-local way (i.e. totally independent of space and time) by a sort of "pilot wave" that works as a real tool to guide the particle. The  10

            particles act in sync with this pilot wave, whose structure is not obvious in the Newtonian world in which we live but exists in an "invisible plane", which affects our reality in a hidden way.  Figure 1.   The quantum entanglement mechanism applied to the spin of two particles.  Essentially, the Universe seems to work through two cross fields, in the same way in which the electromagnetic field described by Maxwell's equations (classical physics) involves an electric field and a magnetic field orthogonal to each other. The quantum realm would be similarly coupled with the classical realm, where the first works in a non-local way and the second in a causal way. The way the two are harmonized is well described by the Bohmian version (from physicist David Bohm) of the Schrödinger equation. Therefore "non-locality"—namely synchronicity, which means total independence from space and time—occurs in the domain of micro-physics while "locality"—i.e. causality, which means that a cause must precede an effect due to an inexorable dependence on space and time where a signal cannot exceed the light speed—is valid only in macro-physics. From all of this it is clear that when we switch from the macro-world—one dominated by the speed of light and described by classical physics and astrophysics—to the micro- world we enter a domain governed by entirely different laws, although both can be described by the same type of sophisticated mathematical infrastructure. But the thing that surprises is that, in the microscopic realm of quantum mechanics, synchronicity between particles becomes possible, so that the communication of information is done by canceling the constraints of both space and time. This mechanism is now technically known in physics as "quantum entanglement" (see Fig. 1). This unsettling properties of elementary particles, which have also been proved in a laboratory—in particular with the double slit experiment and Alain Aspect's experiment on entangled photons in 1982—have, for 15 years, allowed us to realize the mechanism of quantum teleportation, which for now is limited to elementary particles such as photons, electrons, atoms and molecular aggregates, but which in the future may allow us to teleport instantly complex aggregates such as a pen, an insect or even a human body—teleporting it particle by particle as if a supercomputer reconstructs its original aggregation. This stunning synchronic mechanism has nothing to do with transmission of energy—as energy (being the other side of matter) follows only the laws of electromagnetic wave propagation— but rather with transmission of pure information.  11

            Chapter 2: Quantum entanglement and consciousness  Previous studies by quantum physicist David Bohm show that the only way to describe reality completely is to consider the factor "consciousness" as an integrating part of the physical. How did this shocking concept suddenly emerge in physics? The occurrence of synchronicity, typical of the quantum entanglement mechanism, seems to have a sort of "screen player" behind it. Bohm—an academic physicist—devoted his life to studying this, doing most of his work at Birbeck College in London while teaching quantum mechanics. He wrote one of the best and clearest textbooks on quantum physics ever written. One of his talents was to be able to explain in clear terms concepts that normally should be counterintuitive. He had an enormous ability to describe the meaning behind equations, not only their technicality. And he was able to explain difficult and abstract concepts with metaphors. In particular, he used an illuminating metaphor in order to explain the concept of what he called "explicate and implicate orders of reality". This is worth discussing because such a metaphor encapsulates all of his thought and even the sense of part of this book. He called it the "metaphor of the ship". Imagine a ship that is equipped with powerful engines. Of course, the engines are able to move the ship fast and far away. But the engines are totally useless if the ship doesn't know where to go. It might go round and round without a goal. The only way to make a good use of the engines and not to waste propellant is to use a method able to indicate a precise route to the ship. That is radar. In that case the ship will go fast and far away towards a precise direction. So, what are the portents of the engines and radar? The first—the engines—means the realm of matter/energy where everything occurs according to causality and where the events happen in a space-time domain. All this can be described by equations showing how some physical parameters vary with space and time, and constitutes the backbone of so called "classical physics" (such as Newton's and Maxwell's one) including the relativity theory by Einstein too. This is the domain of our normal reality, of our body and of our mind. The second—the radar—means the realm of consciousness—a sort of awareness able to guide matter (starting from elementary particles) towards a specific direction on the basis of a form of "determinism" made of pure information, according to which the realm of matter is constantly informed in a non-local way, namely without any constraint with space and time (synchronicity). The radar clearly represents what Bohm called "quantum potential"— substantially it is the same concept as the aforementioned "pilot wave" concept due to quantum physicist Louis de Broglie—which in its turn represents the reason why the quantum entanglement mechanism exists. On a wider scale the engines represent what Bohm called "explicate order" of reality, the order of locality and causality, while the radar represents the "implicate order", the order of non-locality, synchronicity and consciousness. Through an aimed rewriting of the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics (which describes the quantum state of an elementary particle), Bohm, indeed, found mathematically that both orders of reality are connected—that matter/energy and consciousness are perfectly harmonized together in the Universe. In such a way, locality and non-locality comprise the global fabric of the Universe, where everything that exists has a meaning, being only apparently fragmented (explicate order) but, at the deepest level, being intimately linked as if every object in the Universe were one entity (implicate order). In comparison with epistemology, which represents what we think we know about reality and which is the philosophical structure of standard science when it is applied to the causality realm (explicate order), by adding a non-locality factor Bohm's final goal was to build up an ontology, which represents not just reality as we think to see it but rather reality in its intrinsic form. This is like understanding the laws of Nature by directly living inside it,  12

            where physical laws are not random but rather have a meaning because they are directed by a sort of "universal consciousness" operating in a non-local way. So, what is the reason for the existence of matter/energy and of Life? Probably the reason is that the only way to make consciousness active is to "hang" it to a physical body. Exactly the same connection exists between the brain (matter/energy, engines of the ship) and consciousness (radar of the ship). And yet consciousness cannot manifest itself if an orchestra made of entangled microtubules do not exist in the brain (this issue will be treated later). According to Bohm, matter and consciousness is one entity. Therefore consciousness is the real brain of the universe, while the mind (in particular the rational one) is only a simple "arm" of the body (matter). Through Bohm's theory, physics can describe reality by assuming that an object called "consciousness" is not a transcendent entity as all religions and spiritualism oblige us believe, but rather a physical entity of quantum nature. This means that consciousness is hypothesized by some scientists to behave substantially like the quantum potential driving elementary particles. According to this scenario we could imagine that consciousness is a kind of "non-local radio" connecting us to the entire universe and all the dimensions contained in it. I might also think that those who have truly learned to travel through the cosmos did so because they eventually understood what exactly consciousness is and how it can be enhanced by using sophisticated technologies. I will explain in detail this important topic in the second part of this book. In this context I cannot avoid describing extensively Bohm's theory about that crucial physical factor called "quantum potential"   Q , namely the main "non-local director" of all that which exists in form of "explicate order". The quantum potential has its roots inside the implicate order and is the main operator of the quantum entanglement mechanism. I will now show how the quantum potential enters inside the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics, where Bohm's version is made of a local term (matter/energy) and a non-local term ( Q   itself). If we compare the explicate order to the physical body and the implicate order (through the quantum potential) to consciousness (or even to the so called "spirit") it is easy to see that, if we want to use Bohm's theory, the two orders are strictly linked together and that the one cannot exist without the other. In fact, consciousness, being non-local and out of space and time, is able to be connected with an intermediary of the body: in this case, the brain. To explain this better, let's describe what the classical Schrödinger equation represents and how Bohm drastically modified it by generating a new equation. The original equation due to physicist Erwin Schrödinger substantially shows the way in which the wave function describing an elementary particle such as an electron evolves with the time parameter. This procedure is not able to determine the precise coordinates of the electron but rather a volume of space in which the electron might probably be located. This is what was done in the classical treatment of quantum mechanics, which is not deterministic but rather probabilistic. Bohm modified such an equation by treating the electron not any more probabilistically but rather in a deterministic way (even if this is unconventional determinism, indeed). He obtained this result by representing Schrödinger equation as the summation of two fundamental factors: a causal/local factor that simply describes the trajectory of the electron as if it were a non-quantum classical object (describable by classical Newtonian physics), and a synchronic/non-local factor named quantum potential   Q   that represents a sort of "guide" of the electron. In such a way the description of the electron's behavior becomes deterministic, but in a different way than in classical physics because the quantum potential is non-local. On the contrary, determinism of classical Newtonian physics deals only with the cause-effect principle. Of course, this is not a suitable place to treat  13

            mathematical techniques, but Bohm's equation must be cited because it is the fulcrum of all that which will be discussed in this part of this book and beyond:  The terms   S   and   V   in the equation are respectively the kinetic and potential energy in  the space-time realm,   m   is the mass of the electron,   t   is the time variable, the inverted  "Delta symbol" is the   Laplacian   mathematical operator, and finally   Q   is the quantum  potential defined as: ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ 2  m 2 Q   ∇ ∇ ∇ ∇ − − − − = = = =   h  Where  ρ ρ ρ ρ   is the density of probability, given by   2  ) t , r ( ) t , r (  Ψ Ψ Ψ Ψ ρ ρ ρ ρ   = = = =   , being  ψ ψ ψ ψ   the wave  function, and   r   the spatial coordinate.  The first two summed terms on the right side of the first equation describe the "local"  classic representation of the electron, while the last term on the right,   Q , describes the  quantum potential representing the non-local characterization of the electron. So here we  have substantially two main components: a classical and a non-classical one. The way in  which such two factors are related together, through the equations presented above, show  immediately that at the level of elementary particles the realm of matter/energy/causality  interacts continuously with the realm of consciousness/synchronicity. Here we have two  different worlds that are strictly linked: matter and consciousness, which in their turn  correspond respectively to explicate and implicate orders of reality elaborated by Bohm.  Two apparently antithetic realms are perfectly fitted together: a real one made of  matter/energy and locality (with the light speed limited at c = 300.000 km/sec) and a  virtual one made of pure information and non-locality. The second directs the first: that is  what we call "consciousness" or "spirit", but, if we extend this non-local factor to our human  being, it has nothing to do with our "ego" (the ego looks to be a sort of "sebaceous cyst", but  sometimes it can help to protect us). Religious people call it "God".  Without the non-local world the local/causal world cannot exist, or Life. We will see this  even better when I mention the theory of coherent quantum electrodynamics. The virtual  world has probably created matter in order to understand itself and to feel conscious, and  not just as a "consciousness in power". What we call "spirit" needs matter, because, without  it, it cannot feel conscious. For each non-local consciousness in the world a "neural  correlate" exists being represented by the local/causal world. If such a neural correlate  doesn't exist no consciousness can be manifested.  But the local/causal world does exist. And the non-local world which apparently does  not exist, still acts on the world that exists. It is an indispensable brother to reality and Life,  and is particularly designed (or rather: wanted) for Life. However the condition of  "existence" is a fact about the local/causal world only, and not about the non-local one. The  non-local world does not exist but does more. It allows something to exist. And the purpose  of the Universe as a whole is to exist in reality. Without this it would be impossible for the  Universe to become aware of itself. I do not think that a separated "spiritual universe" and  disembodied spirits exist who are conscious of themselves.  The following definitions: "collective unconscious", "quantum potential", "Planck field",  "field of form", "vector potential", "pilot wave", "scalar field", "quantum vacuum", "Prana",  "Nirvana" 1 , "dreamtime" of the Australian Aborigines, "matrix" (for new agers) and finally  "software" for the computer, refer probably to the same concept, the same idea viewed from  14

            different angles, which may be scientific and non-scientific, psychological, philosophical  and metaphysical.  The point of interest here is that, according to some hypotheses, what we call "human  spirit"—namely a sparkle of a bigger consciousness—might behave exactly in the same way  as an elementary particle if we consider its non-local behavior described by quantum  entanglement. This happens because the "ethereal side" represented by the spirit (or  consciousness within it) is strictly related to the "material side" in form of the DNA and the  human brain (and consequently its brainwave). I think that the spirit is actually located  inside the quantum "cloud of probability" that our instruments cannot see.  But the spirit probably manages to "see" what is happening inside the cloud of  probability and without any need to make the wave function collapse: nevertheless the only  way to manifest what the spirit sees is to have a brain. The spirit is engaged to the matter  (with mass), but being made of "pixels of consciousness" it does not respond to the laws of  matter, but only to those of the form, i.e. information contained in it and absorbed all the  time. Then it is logical to assert that the realm of matter obeys the orders given by the pixels  of consciousness and not vice versa. The "shape" of the spirit is the container of those pixels  of consciousness and represents an actual software able to trigger actions by interacting  with matter itself, changing it depending on which type of information it transmits, since,  according to my guess, matter itself is bound in turn to the pixels of consciousness whose  main software is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, where elementary particles are ordered  inside the various quantum states in pairs of spin-up and spin-down modes. This  fundamental principle of quantum physics will be discussed later in this book.  15

            Chapter 3: A quantum pilot for the body  Let's now consider the physical body and the way in which it is non-locally governed.  According to the studies of theoretical physicist Emilio Del Giudice, something called  "quantum coherence" governs all the cells of living beings. This is a mechanism of quantum  mechanics involving a specific "interactive field" having the property of piloting  simultaneously all the cells of a biological body (that's the reason of "coherence"), by kind of  synchronizing their functioning inside the body so that health is perfectly guaranteed. This  "pilot action" becomes active on the cells of the body by triggering an electromagnetic field  (describable by classical physics) able to affect the cells. So here we have a quantum field of  pure informative character triggering an electromagnetic field of purely physical character  that is in its turn able to affect the cells at the level of its atoms.  The quantum field looks like a sort of "software" that communicates non-locally (i.e.  simultaneously) with a "hardware" called "body", using an electromagnetic field. All of this  is also related to recent research such as the one by biophysicists Peter Gariaev and Fritz  Albert Popp according to whom the DNA of the body is able to produce   weak radiation  known as   "biophotons"   (measured using the same types of photomultipliers used in  astronomical photometry)   while the DNA itself seems to be the connection link between the  physical body and something else that could be called "spirit": in such a case the spirit could  be simply a coherent quantum field. This means that something pretty physical seems to be  at work, also when the "spirit factor" is considered.   Therefore biophotons are the main  markers of phenomena showing a high degree of quantum coherence and the main  mechanism of transport of non-local information between cells in the human body through  that which is called quantum coherence. In fact, there seems to be quantum coherence even  in microtubules forming the neurons of the brain, with truly revolutionary consequences for  what concerns the mechanism by which consciousness works.  The one described above would be therefore a "self-regulatory mechanism" of structures  of order and coherence, able to govern in a non-local way also all that which is living. The  DNA would have a vital role in this process as it is able to produce ultra-weak cell radiation  in the form of biophotons. All this suggests that a sort of "outer matrix" is able to govern  intelligently the body of living creatures. Biophotons seem to be the main marking  phenomena showing a high degree of coherence (in the quantum sense) and the main  mechanism of non-local transport of information between cells. All of this represents what  is the universal phenomenon of Life, its birth, its development and its evolution.  According to the latest research by some biophysicists, DNA does not behave only as a  simple programmer of cellular activities, but also as an electromagnetic emitter to control  cellular processes. It is assumed that biophotons act through all the electromagnetic  emissions of DNA, distributed in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, including  audio, visible, infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. Thus, the DNA would not only be the  depository of the well known genetic code managing the sequence of amino acids in  proteins, but would be able also to act as an active electromagnetic supervisor of all cellular  processes, and it would take in its turn orders from a kind of external "software" operating  in a non-local way: in practice, the body would be constantly accompanied by a kind of  "control". And then living matter would be able to "resonate" with certain orders.  Under the new vision that is already emerging from the interweaving of theoretical  studies of quantum physics and experimental studies of biophysics, it appears therefore that  living matter cannot be reduced solely to its molecular components, but must be conceived  as molecules oscillating in tune with an electromagnetic field confined within a domain of  coherence, in turn governed by what is called a "vector potential" having non-local  characteristics, and therefore typical of the quantum behavior, in particular the  entanglement phenomenon. Recent research, such as the one carried out by Gariaev,  16

            suggests that the collective coherence observed in the assembly of cells, would be led by  non-local links between electromagnetic fields in form of Laser biophotons and polarized  radio waves, through DNA, which would function as a "holographic projector" of the genetic  code.  Thus, an electromagnetic field would drive the molecular growth of a living organism  through a molecular "biofield" performing through biophotons. The focal point of these  findings is that the radio waves produced by entanglement with Laser biophotons of the  basic hologram would be able to induce morphogenetic changes in living organisms, also in  order to repair any damage at the genetic level, because these waves would send in a  coherent and non-local way information on the "correct plan" inherent in the holographic  memory of DNA: it would be so that Life processes are maintained, continuously  performing corrections.  The coexistence of (quantum) coherent and incoherent (or chaotic) realms within the  biological material, as well as the coexistence of the "vector potential" and of the  electromagnetic field (in its turn closely linked to the atomic matter) is an alternative way to  describe, in molecular physics, the coexistence of the implicate order and the explicate order  coming from Bohm's theory. At this point, the molecular world, and the cell world with it,  typical of the mechanism of Life, would seem to follow the same universal rule. The process  of existence would then be the result of a harmonious blend of locality/causality and non-  locality.  In light of what has been said so far, no one can rule out the possibility of "life after  death". This wouldn't be at all a religious or metaphysical concept or a blind belief based on  faith but rather a purely evolutionary fact—which maybe one day our physics will discover  in connection with biophysical studies about the DNA driving our physical life—concerning  the "matrix" wearing our body as a dress, which most call "spirit", but which the physicists  of the future might call "electrodynamic quantum coherent biofield". When we find out  exactly what an object called "spirit" is and why it exists, we could perhaps vastly expand  our knowledge about how to develop the "intelligence" outside us. Perhaps this is what we  are destined to attempt  Surely consciousness—through what we call "spirit"—changes because through the  bodies in which it passes it is enriched by experience, i.e. by updated information. And more  information is acquired more power is gained. In light of the previous reasoning about the  "mind-matter connection" consciousness is kind of obliged to have a close relationship with  the corporeal vehicle (the body), especially with the brain and the DNA (and related  biophotons). So I think that the best way to study consciousness experimentally is to study  the traces it leaves in neurons, for example, or in the DNA. It is possible that a part of the  experience gained from a given consciousness may be recoverable in the corporeal vehicle,  which could function as "hardware" able to make the "software" active, i.e. being the  consciousness its host. I think that it is in our body that we have to look for signs of this  memory.  17

            Chapter 4: The quantum brain  Let's now speak about the brain and the way in which consciousness is related to it.   As a  neural correlate of consciousness our brain represents a marvelous "connection terminal"  with the entire Universe through the non-local quantum dimension. The source of all of this  starts from the concept of "quantum coherence". This is a form of quantum entanglement,  or non-local behavior, in which a cluster of many particles are close together (and not  distant), constituting together a single unity and acting in unison, which can be described by  the same wave function (through Schrödinger equation) as if they were only one entity. In  the previous chapter we have seen that quantum coherence governs all the cells of our body  too. This kind of phenomenon occurs also in a Laser beam, a Bose-Einstein condensate of  atoms and even plasma at certain circumstances. But it seems not to stop here.  At present, the mechanism of quantum entanglement, or synchronicity in physics, is fully confirmed only in the case of very small objects such as elementary particles. Yet theoretical models exist that posit the possibility that this phenomenon may be operating also in domains larger than a particle, through the so called "mesoscopic domains". In particular, joint work by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff suggest that microtubules (and tubulins inside them) have a non-local behavior similar to that of elementary particles. According to their theory, inside the brain a billion of these microtubules are activated being in a constant state of entanglement between them as if they were musical instruments playing the same note at the same time: this is a typical case of quantum coherence of mesoscopic objects described by only one wave function as if they were only one entity. As soon as the wave function collapses this orchestra of microtubules passes from a state of suspended animation to a state of concreteness. This leads to the formation of a moment of consciousness, which occurs at least a million times a day for an average human being. In this way and according to this theory, the brain, in addition to being a quantum object in its entirety, is nothing but the neural correlate of consciousness itself. In a nutshell this means that the material world—the brain in this case—is closely linked to the world of consciousness, as if matter itself were constantly accompanied by its "ghost guide", which in turn uses specific conditions within matter to manifest. But this is exactly what is described by Bohm's equation for an elementary particle, where a local/causal realm is strictly linked with a non-local/a-causal realm through the quantum potential. Therefore, the brain acquires exactly the same role as the physical and causal macro-universe, while consciousness is a non-local process able to manifest when some particular conditions of quantum coherence are present in the brain. In such a way, starting with what occurs in an elementary particle, the universe is a sort of "process" in which the "body" of the particle responds to causal/local laws of physics, while the "consciousness" of the particle obeys to a-causal/non-local laws coming from the quantum potential. Exactly the same, according to Penrose and Hameroff, occurs in the microtubules composing our brain's neurons, whose "bodies" create the right condition to realize non- locality in form of what we call "consciousness" (see Fig. 2). According to this theory the brain and the universe are linked by the same subtle substance. All of this can be explained by physics. All the billions microtubules are kind of a single "oneness" all the time, and they are described by a single quantum wave function. They are physical entities permitting to consciousness to manifest. But consciousness is the most fundamental characteristic of the spirit. In human physical beings all the process starts from the physical: the brain.  18

            Figure 2.   The brain and its connection with the explicate and implicate orders of the Universe.  Standard knowledge about the brain insists on a mechanical model, according to which  consciousness is merely a purely electrical process—and therefore based on the limit of the  light speed, but not quantum—triggered by the continuous exchange of energy taking place  between neurons. In fact, according to the conventional approach it is believed that neurons  and their chemical synapses are the fundamental units of information in the brain, and that  the experience of consciousness emerges when a critical level of complexity in the neural  network of the brain is reached. The processing of information in this case would be  completely algorithmic, like in the computer that we have on our table, even though, of  course, much more complex. Even today many persons go on believing that the brain—with  its 100 billion neurons, each of which contains 1.000 to 10.000 synapses working as  switches running hundreds times per second and with a number of operations of about 10 15  processing per second—functions like a desktop computer.  But a new theory contradicts such an old mechanistic vision. According to Stuart  Hameroff the microtubules present within each nerve cell (neuron) are able to produce  states of quantum coherence within the totality of the brain, so that quantum coherence  between tubulins inside each microtubule, distributed in the brain (in a way similar to what  happens in Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms) becomes possible. Such a coherence and  the quantum entanglement processes (in this case linking very close entities) taking place  make the tubulins entities that may assume the same characteristics as electrons or photons  (elementary particles) in entangled state, but where we do not have simple pairs of particles  in a state of entanglement, but rather billions of them.  This complex of tubulins is described by only one wave function as if they were only one  entity. The collapse of the wave function describing such states of quantum coherence leads  to the formation of consciousness. In the first phase, we have an "unconscious moment"  corresponding to the quantum superposition of 10 9   tubulin states, a kind of "limbo of  consciousness" of very short duration. In the second phase we have the "conscious  moment", corresponding to the collapse of the wave function which gathered within a single  quantum state the global entanglement complex combining microtubules in the brain: this  second phase is referred to as "Orchestrated Objective Reduction" (OrchOR).  Why microtubules and their tubulins? Microtubules are the main component of the cell  cytoskeleton, which forms a sort of skeleton of the cells. They are a fundamental part of  neurons in the brain. Their role is to adjust the connections between the synapses. It turned  out that microtubules are the nervous and "circulatory" system of the cells. They move  everything in the cells by organizing their form and function, and they communicate with  the membranes and with nuclear DNA.  Microtubules are real units with their own intelligence, to the point that a being as the  single-celled paramecium can swim, learn, avoid predators, find food and reproduce only  thanks to microtubules, and without the need of synapses (since it is free of them). But,  above all, their well-established character of quantum coherence (manifested through the  emission of biophotons) make them an ideal terrain in a way that striking quantum effects  19

            can take place, even considering that the special conditions of isolation of microtubules in  the brain through the mediation of a type of "gel" make them sufficiently resistant to the  phenomenon of decoherence   2 .  The physically important fact here is that each tubulin composing microtubules behaves  like a kind of electric dipole, being able to acquire two states of electrical polarization, based  on the states 1 and 0. In this way each tubulin is similar to the on-off circuits of a computer.  Therefore, tubulins within microtubules may play the role of a "Bit". In this case we have  some real "proteinaceous dipoles", whose distribution in the walls of each microtubule can  excite the water molecules inside the nucleus of the same microtubule. Then it happens that  if many of these dipoles are triggered, the energy itself of water molecules is induced into a  state of high quantum coherence. In this way, tubulins and water molecules form a highly  cooperative system.  In conclusion, the idea of focusing the attention on microtubules as quantum objects is  motivated by the need to find a suitable environment in the brain allowing quantum states  to live long enough before interactions with the typical environment (warm and liquid) of  the brain destroys them generating the phenomenon of decoherence. But microtubules are  an ideal place because tubulins within them may remain for some time under a quantum  superposition state, while at the same time microtubules in the brain are found together in a  perfect state of entanglement.  But these two properties—quantum superposition and quantum entanglement—are  used precisely in quantum computers, where what matters are not Bits made of states being  either 0 or 1, but rather Qbits, representing overlaps of 0 and 1. Then when someone  observes or measures Qbits their superposition state collapses in such a way that the states  of 0 or 1 are chosen. Quantum computation itself is algorithmic, but only at the moment of  collapse of the superposed quantum states it happens that a non-algorithmic influence  occurs. How does this happen in the brain?  Theoretical physicist Roger Penrose explains the process of formation of a "moment of  consciousness"—figured out as an "orchestrated collapse" of the wave function. He  describes tubulins linked together by entanglement as a spontaneous disturbance occurring  at the level of the Planck Field (10 -33   cm, this is the quantum vacuum) by manifesting both  quantum and relativistic effects. This is respectively because infinitely small dimensions are  involved and because spacetime is involved as well. In this way, the brain becomes no more  than a carrier able to manifest consciousness which in fact is "elsewhere". The greater the  Energy   E   associated with the mass of microtubules (depending on the number of them) the  lower the Time   t   at which the collapse takes place and the greater the number of  consciousness moments in the course of a day.  On average, for a man, a "moment of consciousness" generated by this mechanism lasts  1/60 of a second, so that about one million moments of consciousness can be experienced in  the course of a day.   On the contrary an amoeba (which also contains microtubules, even if in small numbers) experiences only a dozen such moments. That's makes the human one a  superior being compared to the amoeba.   It is evident that if the value of   E   tends to infinity  the time   t   tends to zero, namely to no time. This is an "asymptotic situation" that someone  might define "God".  All of this means that consciousness, in order to be manifested, needs necessarily a  "body". This body, within the brain, is represented by microtubules and tubulins within  them and by their quantum coherence. This is the only way to make the wave function  collapse. Otherwise the orchestra of microtubules would remain in a superposition state  bringing to no consciousness. Of course this is not the only kind of body that can make a  20

            consciousness manifest, but it is the only one (biological) that we know so far. In principle,  whatever contains a sufficient degree of quantum coherence—which must not be necessarily  biological—may potentially bring to the formation of a kind of consciousness: this might be  a Laser, a Bose-Einsten condensate, plasma or even a Fullerene molecule. What matters  here is that the value of   E   is sufficiently high. It is not impossible to imagine that intelligent  beings somewhere in the Universe might have a value of   E   greater or much greater than our  brain's.  Penrose-Hameroff's is today a well established theory about brain and consciousness,  which is subject to continuous improvements, and in spite of some criticism from other  scientists (such as Max Tegmark's one), this theory is becoming increasingly popular  nowadays inside the scientific community.  Interesting parallel research is being carried out theoretically by Italian physicist Paola  Zizzi. She is considering the Universe as a brain on a very large scale. According to her  theory and calculations, during the inflationary period of the Big Bang the universe was a  "Multiverse" which was in a state of quantum superposition of multiple universes, until  something—a mysterious "observer from the outside", or the underlying Planck field—  triggered, at the end of the era of Inflation, the collapse of the wave function of the  Multiverse by inducing, through a certainly very sophisticated process of "measurement", a  conscious choice among the infinite suspended possibilities: the Universe in which we live.  Scaled down, this is exactly the same thing happening when the wave function holding  together tubulins and microtubules in our brain suddenly collapses as an orchestrated  objective reduction (OrchOr), resulting in the formation of a consciousness moment. In the  case of the "Universal Wave Function" the number of quantum superpositions created  before the collapse corresponds to 10 9   Universes. But this is also the number of tubulins that  are expected to be in a state of superposition in our brain and then are prone to collapse in  order to produce a consciousness moment. Only one difference exists here: the time t = 10 -34  seconds (Planck Time), which is equivalent to the " Consciousness Moment of the Universe"  when it materialized only one of the endless possibilities, the one in which we live since  about 14 billion years.  21

            Chapter 5: A quantum spirit?  At this point, it is more than evident that the question of the "spirit" comes out strongly. The spirit—in its turn related to what we call "soul"—belongs to the consciousness realm. It might be thought as a sparkle of a bigger fire joining all the other sparks in a synchronous way as if they were only one thing, totally unaffected by any limit of space and time. So, what happens to the spirit when at death it leaves the body? I believe that this was the last question that David Bohm asked himself. The problem was that during his life, as his thought deepened, he started to leave the realm of mathematical physics to approach a sort of "platonic philosophy" where epistemology is replaced by ontology, being, first, a sort of "mental map" of what we think reality is and, second, reality itself as it is directly lived by our own emotions. Bohm conceived a Universe with meaning. That's why he searched for an ontological sense in his physics. He never accepted the mechanistic vision of conventional physics, even of classical quantum mechanics, the first treating all the things (and even living beings) as if they were many gears of a clock or a robot, the second considering the smallest dimension of reality (the one of elementary particles) as a pure probability function. So what gives meaning to all that exists? Evidently consciousness. And what is the container of consciousness for a living being? That is certainly the spirit, namely a quantum coherent field entirely ruling a living being, which is more or less full of consciousness according to the level of biological complexity and evolution of such a being, and which is also logically expected to be a non-local field that memorizes all the experience done (thoughts and emotions) by a living being. In a way, the spirit is the "radar" of a living physical being, to use the most famous Bohm metaphor. Without it, such a being would be blind, as would a moving ship without such a facility. Knowing that such a quantum coherent field (the spirit) is strictly related to a bigger consciousness it is expected that, at death, it will reconnect to it directly by bringing to it all the wealth of experience acquired when such a spirit was inside a body. Of course, the memory of the experiences during physical life would be transmitted to the big source to which it would reconnect in the form of pure information. This would be like enriching an ocean with more crystalline drops—as if it were necessary to give God the possibility to feel more conscious of himself thanks to the experience lived by our spirit. The information acquired by the spirit might look like a recorded tape. In a way, our spirit is supposed to be nothing more than the "black box" (i.e. a flight recorder) of our airplane, namely our body. Clearly a crashed airplane doesn't work anymore as it is made only of smoldering wreckage, but the information inside that box remains intact. Only during subsequent phases such information is transferred where it is more natural to do that, in order to let the spirit make some other "round of carousel" allowing it to refine, widen and expand the information collected during each life cycle. This seems to be a truly harmonic and marvelous mechanism, and even logical. In order that such evolutionary process of the spirit is realized, I believe that some "Builders" (the same as "Creators") able to see that everything works properly and that the creative process proceeds in the right direction, exist. I have a strong feeling that the "trespass mechanism" (yet natural per se) is a process that is guided and technologically controlled by ultra-advanced sentient beings. I imagine them as a sort of "midwives" operating inside an aseptic room, assisting babies at the moment of their birth. More realistically and according to Penrose-Hameroff theory about consciousness, if it is not simply an energetic-informative "track" left here by people who once were living on Earth, that spirit must acquire a "body" of some kind in order to be conscious of itself and then consequently be able to communicate with other spirits on its own initiative. If the spirit of a deceased person is connected with the spirit of a living one (or vice versa) telling  22

            him/her that he has a problem it might be conscious of itself in doing this. It is not even necessary that its new body is located in another dimension, as it might be also here in the form of plasma, a Fullerene molecule, a Bose-Einstein condensate or even a Laser, or physical means of whatever nature that may allow a form of quantum coherence. The three cited objects are important examples of quantum coherent entities, i.e. where the particles composing them are all entangled together in order to guarantee the existence of consciousness. A Bose-Einstein condensate is a conglomerate of atoms that has been obtained by cooling matter to the absolute zero temperature in order to stop thermal motions of atoms. As soon as this procedure is done such a condensate acquires a quantum coherent structure in form of a sort of "dark cloud", where each atom has lost its individuality so that all of those atoms together acquire a unique quantum entity as if they were only one thing consequently described by a unique wave function (as it happens, for instance, in the microtubules of the brain). In fact, if only one of such atoms is perturbed by some cause all the others will react synchronously. More or less the same thing occurs in the Laser (pure energy of photons, not particles of matter such as atoms), of which a Bose-Einstein condensate is the atomic equivalent. In fact a Laser is characterized by photons (pure energy) that are spatially perfectly coherent in the quantum way, i.e. its photons can be described by only one wave function as if all the photons were the same thing. Fullerene molecules are derived from the Carbon chemical element, which acquires a perfectly spherical shape behaving as if its atoms were one entity. It is even logical to hypothesize that such a departing spirit must be "cleaned" of the errors or the bad energies that it collected during a life. Certainly, the big ocean of consciousness would be polluted, as if a new software containing viruses were installed over the software of the main operative system. So it could be necessary that, before having access to the big ocean, such a spirit analyzed itself in order to understand its mistakes. This could be a sort of debugging as happens in computers. This might connect with reincarnating in another body, which could be human, non-human, and even non- biochemical. Or it might be necessary simply to rest for a time—especially if that spirit has been damaged during the period in which it was living inside a body. The resting phase is well represented symbolically by the Greek myth of the River of Lethe, where spirits stay for a certain time before being re-activated in order to get new phases and forms of life and consciousness. Once more, how to relate the human spirit to the engine-radar metaphor by Bohm? Clearly the body is the engine while the spirit is radar. It is logical to think that even the most beautiful body without a spirit is a sterile object, practically a robot which, if it is without an independent guide of its own, might be also remotely controlled by someone else. The spirit not only memorizes our life experience by learning through errors but is a guide too. I visualize the spirit as if it were a kite attached to our body through a wire, being the wire the connection link that allows transferring all the data collected from the body directly to the spirit. In this way the body is like hardware such as a personal computer and the spirit is both the software driving it and a form of memory storage. When the computer dies all the data is automatically saved on that software, waiting to find another computer where such software is able to run it again. When the body dies the wire breaks and the kite flies away. I see the kite also as a "sensor" able to measure all that happens to a living being and to record everything like a USB pen drive. Therefore it is not difficult to visualize the spirit as a system of information, but which is not necessarily an "identity" per se. Probably the so called "identity" is only the part of a comedy that one experiences during life in order to permit to the true inner "entity" to learn. I believe that our true identity is not what we think we are—namely, our ego—but I also think that such an "artificial identity through comedy"  23

            is anyway memorized by the spirit as a reference point for that spirit, something provisional that the spirit uses to defend itself during the various lives: a sort of mask, and nothing more than that. That's what I think of the so called "ego".  24

            Chapter 6: The spirit and synchronicity  Today the physics of consciousness is getting more and more elaborated. Our standard  physics still depends on the (artificial, with no doubts in the light of all that which has been  said here) division between matter/energy and consciousness, respectively called by  philosopher Cartesius "res extensa" and "res cogitans". But the birth and development of  quantum physics, in particular the theoretical and experimental demonstration of "non-  locality", through the mechanism of quantum entanglement whose nature is well explained  by the so called "quantum potential" by physicist David Bohm, has opened a gate. After all  Bohm's version of the famous Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics shows alone  how the locality and causality of matter/energy (explicate order) is linked with the non-  locality and a-causality of consciousness (implicate order).  The concepts described above share a strong similarity with what was developed during  the long-lasting discussions between Nobel Prize physicist Wolfgang Pauli and analytic  psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, according to which the most intimate structure of "Reality"  is represented by the symbol of a cross where locality and non-locality are interlaced  through a unique entity.  The one visualized during the joint work between Pauli and Jung took the name of  "Psychophysical Universe" and has indeed the shape of a cross (see Fig. 3). In the vertical  axis, the northern pole represents "psychical continuum", while the southern pole  represents "space-time continuum". In the horizontal axis the western pole represents  "causality", while the eastern pole represents "synchronicity". Such a cross diagram shows  an interplay between the quantitative parameters characterizing the world of matter/energy  (space-time continuum and causality) and described by classical physics, and the qualitative  parameters characterizing the world of consciousness (psychical continuum and  synchronicity) and that someone is trying to describe using quantum physics. Such an  interplay is manifested by a sort of oscillation between the ego belonging to the realm of  causality and the "self" (originating from the so called "archetypes" according to Jung)  belonging to the realm of non-locality.  Figure 3.   Cross diagram describing the Psychophysical Universe by Jung and Pauli.  Substantially this famous qualitative diagram describes what Bohm tried to represent  quantitatively using his famous equation, which harmonically relates the causal mechanical  trajectory of an elementary particle (the engine of the ship, from Bohm's metaphor) with the  non-local guide by the quantum potential (the radar of the ship). Therefore it is quite easy  to see here that Pauli (inspired by the theory of archetypes by Jung) and Bohm were telling  the same thing: the mechanical trajectory works inside a space-time continuum and by  causality, so representing Bohm's explicate order, while the quantum potential works inside  25

        <section id="page-26">
            a psychic continuum in a synchronic way and it represents Bohm's implicate order. Of  course the quantum potential can explain the reason of the synchronicity phenomenon—  deeply studied by Jung, and originating from the archetype realm according to his  interpretation—that occurs when a thought of a person is done coincidentally with an event  occurring outside. But synchronicity phenomena are substantially a variant of the quantum  entanglement phenomenon (formulated in terms of physics). I will say more lately about  this. If we assume to live inside a Multiverse and want to find the equation of motion of the Multiverse as a whole we find that the local standard of rest is the Multiverse itself. Inside it objects move, but the Multiverse is still because its alter ego (i.e. its real identity) is a point, which has many "mirror-points" from where the reality of cause and effect is born when that point is activated by generating universes. I think that point is consciousness—one and only one—not many consciousnesses that would be only the many tentacles of only one jellyfish. The moment we experience synchronistic events we come suddenly projected to that point for a microsecond and at that time we create an event by generating particular timelines, which serve to perfect our life and our evolution. Then the border between synchronicity and causality I think is the act of Creation, which is generated by consciousness. I think that the archetypes of Jung, i.e. those entities generating synchronicity, are a humanistic and philosophical way to simply describe a big "information system" made of clusters of pixels or "particles of consciousness", those which command as a (non-local) "central control" all the spirits in the universe. Otherwise the spirit would be inert and completely devoid of information. I imagine an archetype as a power plant, and the spirits as light bulbs inside homes. If the power plant is not working bulbs remain off. Probably the spirit is the program that works with an operating system represented by archetypes. In this light the Universe could be considered as a supercomputer.  The Pauli's Exclusion Principle (see Fig. 4), which is one of the pillars of quantum physics, states that two electrons can occupy the same atomic orbital provided that they have their spin (rotation) in the opposite direction. This was the great discovery by Wolfgang Pauli, which led him to meet with the mystery of "synchronicity" as it was deeply studied by Jung. The particularity with which the Exclusion Principle is expressed is that the way in which electrons are arranged in the quantum orbitals of the atom is not causal or sequential, but rather synchronic. It is a kind of "dance" of the particles taking place with perfect synchronization. The exclusion between equal particles (with the same spin) is not in any way the result of a force, since here the cause-effect principle is not valid as normally it occurs in classical physics (for example in the principles of classical dynamics), but is the result of an "abstract movement" of the particles taken all together. Here a causative principle doesn't exist, but rather a real synchronicity that simultaneously combines all the particles into an indissoluble interconnection. In this case the existence of a "field of form" is invoked by Pauli, as a sort of non-local director of matter. This concept matches perfectly with Bohm's quantum potential. It is not then a surprise that Pauli was suddenly interested also in the synchronicity events occurring in the human sphere, as if what he had found in his Exclusion Principle of elementary particles was similar to what happens to humans. More generally, the synchronic dance of the coupled (spin-up and spin-down) electrons inside quantum states seems to reflect the existence of a "soul" in the Universe as a whole. Therefore, the synchronicity phenomenon must have a relationship with that which happens in elementary particles. The long-standing interdisciplinary collaboration born and developed between Pauli and Jung had the main intent of finding a truly scientific method able to explain the  26

        <section id="page-27">
            existence of the collective unconscious, archetypes, and especially the phenomenon of synchronicity. The two scholars didn't build a quantitative model, but still managed to represent intuitively using a simple sketch the way in which the concept of "field of the form" could explain phenomena of the human psyche and the way in which the world of matter/energy is concatenated with the world of thought/consciousness. What Pauli and Jung were searching for was a different way to represent exactly the same concepts that were later elaborated by Bohm about the implicate order starting from the quantum potential and its eminently non-local character.  Figure 4.   The Pauli Exclusion Principle as an ordering mechanism in the quantum states of the atom.  Jung's and Pauli's long-dated collaboration was aimed at the construction of a science of "psychophysics" as a first step towards a more structured issue as it is being developed nowadays. They started to depict qualitatively the possible existence of a link between mind and matter using their cross-shaped "quaternary diagram" where the two interact together very strictly. But this is an intuitive form of Bohm's version of the Schrödinger Equation, where matter and mind (psyche) are strictly linked together through the quantum potential. The synchronicity human phenomenon might be a manifestation of the consciousness of the universe, of which the human psyche (strictly related to the spirit) might be a sort of "terminal" that is non-locally connected to its source. In this vision the "implicate order" of Bohm should be nothing but the realm of archetypes of Jung. Pauli and Bohm—two famous quantum physicists—were facing the same problem indeed. The peculiarity of Pauli, while collaborating with Jung, was that he experienced himself many synchronicities, so that, differently from most of other physicists, he had a deep relationship with his own psyche. This happened in such a way that, in addition to impressive synchronicities and apparent telekinetic phenomena, he often had the same kind of recurring dreams about "pulsation" and "rotation". How could this be interpreted? The first idea that comes to mind is that pulsation and rotation combined together make a spiral, which is mathematically described by the Fibonacci sequence   3 . Such a famous mathematical series links the infinitely small with the infinitely large. This is as if the psychic realm of the spirit is subject to a sort of "oscillation". Is such an oscillation able to affect non-locally the geometry and the dynamics of spacetime so that synchronicities occur? Is this the mechanism through which Creation occurs? This will remain an open question for a long time, which eventually physics will have to solve. Cognitive scientist Christine Hardy has already elaborated a very interesting  27
            <div class="page-number">Page 27 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-28">
            model that might furnish a qualitative solution, dealing with her ideas about "semantic fields" and the meaning of the spiral symbol. Two different experiences in physics—the one by David Bohm and the one by Wolfgang Pauli—have brought substantially to the same conclusions. Bohm, in particular, was able to refine mathematically the concept of non-locality, being also able to build up a solid theoretical framework of the quantum entanglement mechanism. Anyway still much work has to be done on the theoretical side. Equations must be still further expanded and transformed in such a way that space and time as independent variables disappear to be replaced by topological variables. This work is now going on through the brain of some theoretical physicists of this millennium, such as Basil Hiley, for instance. Pauli approached the same problem in a different way. By reflecting on his most important discovery (his famous Exclusion Principle) he found that a form of synchronicity does exist inside matter particles. At the same time he found that another form of synchronicity sometimes occurs between the human psyche and external events. This experience made him meet Carl Jung as a kind of a significant synchronicity, with whom he started to wonder how mind and matter interact together through non-local processes. Jung's experience on archetypes (to which human synchronicity is linked according to Jung) seems to converge with what some theoretical physicists are searching for, culminating in the concept of "implicate order" and, most of all, in the way in which this order interacts continuously with the "explicate order" of our spatiotemporal reality.  As we have previously seen, according to Penrose-Hameroff theory, quantum physics is  now able to explain how consciousness is formed (the orchestrated collapse of only one  wave function describing the quantum state of our many brain microtubules), where (here  too) consciousness and its neural correlate (our brain) are intimately related. On a wider  scale, such as in the case of the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) created and directed by  scientist Roger Nelson, deviations from randomness recorded by REG (Random Event  Generator) machines occurred during dramatic and highly emotional events in the world  seem to symptomatically demonstrate that a "collective consciousness" does exist as well,  where the spirits of many persons are "synchronized" when particular events occur. On a  wider scale this seems to be the same as it is occurring with microtubules in the brain.  If an evolution of these studies occurs there is good reason to believe that the old Cartesian thinking will be erased from the history of science, to make way for an entirely  new physics and a new way of seeing the world.   My feeling is that the Physics of the next  decades will penetrate all that once was considered "spirituality". This will not degrade the  "power of faith" of the individual but will certainly reduce the role, and power of  institutional religions. I have strong reasons to think that this will help us to contact "other  intelligences" in this strange Universe, and also help us to understand how the worm turns  into a butterfly when we die. I deeply feel that the Universe is much more marvelous than  we ever thought, and that a form of "alchemy" is about to occur inside us.  This epoch is critical. On one side we see the triumph of materialism and technology; on  the other, a collapse of spiritual values in favor of material goods, comforts and money.  Wars are developing everywhere, fanaticism dramatically increasing, and hunger as well,  due to the disparity between rich and poor. At the same time, a new form of spirituality is  growing. Much or it is naïve new age, but something else—especially if accompanied with  new physics theories and crucial discoveries—is genuine. And this requires us to make a  quantum leap. This is merely an evolutionary process—often dramatic as childbirth may  be—and one that no one can escape.  28

            Chapter 7: Multidimensionality and synchronicity  One way to give a physical explanation of the mystical experience is to ask why certain experiences do not happen. They don't happen because the particles of consciousness constituting our spirit are all closed in a kind of cocoon. They stay there simply because the spirit is afraid to crumble and to lose its identity, and cleaves to the ego, which is precisely its cocoon. But the ego is also spiritual blindness. When the spirit overcomes fear it realizes that it cannot crumble—simply because the particles constituting it do not scatter but simply "turn on a switch" that potentially connects them non-locally to all the other particles of the universe. Once the fear is banished, ecstasy follows, and knowledge with it. Is it possible to induce a mystical experience non-chemically, but physically? Perhaps it is, by acting directly on the charge of the particles of consciousness (if they truly exist)— assuming, by hypothesis, that they are true massless particles with electrical charge—which is not necessarily an integer, but may be a fractional number. Such particles might possibly have a "color charge" (albeit without mass) that is conceptually similar to that of quarks. Perhaps an electrostatic tool instructed in a precise way might activate the process. Certainly here Tesla-like technology is involved. But I am sure that if such a technology exists, then it would, in principle, be able to make an exact copy of the spirit of a person, teleporting the information of the particles of consciousness onto a similar group of particles located somewhere else. Theoretically, the spirit, being pure information, is replicable, and perhaps this might explain bilocation, for example, or even more the fact that some persons find within themselves an identity not belonging to them, which often leads to schizophrenia. As it was written before, the spirit could be also considered as something similar to the "black box" of an airplane, able to record everything of the flight. The information contained in that spirit could be potentially used, if someone has found out scientifically the way to extract it, from both the living and the dead. This information might be implanted inside other bodies or even inside some machines. The unconscious inside us plays a tremendously important role. If we knew the mechanism behind it we would be close to the knowledge of the alleged "Builders" of our Universe. The unconscious is hypothesized to be a database. What connects us to this database? A search like Google using the Internet? It might be almost like that, conceptually. In this case I think it is our unconscious that connects to the "website", namely the "stored part", of the so-called "field" planned and prepared by someone else. We connect each time our unconscious feels the need, and if we connect the answer often comes. But science must also understand how this process works. We should not limit ourselves to make these experiences. Also we have to explain them. In the case of the synchronicity phenomenon we might ask ourselves what affinity exists between an event (i.e. something occurring in a given time and space) and a thought. We should specify that the thought is not something coming from the intellect but rather from the psyche. But the psyche is the spirit, which is a kind of "bubble made of pixels of consciousness", which is expected to be a part of the fabric of spacetime (and, in turn, of the quantum vacuum). What happens during those magical moments? Let's imagine that the spirit—a sort of "atom" made of many "pixels of consciousness" having a purely informative power—is an integral part of spacetime, as I imagine it to be. But which spacetime do we mean? A flat space? No. According to quantum physics, there are endless possibilities—as many as the radii of a sphere. Let's imagine then the spirit at the center of this sphere and that the radii are all possible timelines which in turn mark a space where manifestations occur. The spirit is potentially in contact with all these timelines, provided that it launches and/or receives a command. The spirit chooses a timeline (for instance, the one where famous Jung's scarab 4   flies), and connects with it non-locally and makes a "copy" (as we do on our computers) of that  29

            piece of the timeline and then "paste" it on the timeline where the person normally lives. This is when the thought is synchronized with an event. It may be that the spirit, in order to do this, has to receive a command from the outside. Where does such command come from? It must necessarily come from a sort of "central computer". Why does the spirit receive that command? Because the central computer has detected a problem with the person owning that spirit, who needs to receive information. In essence, the central computer connects to one of the terminals making it active and gives the order to that terminal to issue another order directed at a particular radius of the sphere. We hypothesized how synchronicity might work from an informatics point of view. We can use the same mechanism to understand how premonition works. In this specific case the spirit does not change the timeline (the one chosen by the person to live for a while), but simply makes a leap forward along that same timeline, copies the information and then pastes it not on the point in present time that continues to run regularly but rather in its mass memory, doing all this in a non-local way. What drives the spirit to do this? Probably the trigger comes from an emotion of someone who suffers or rejoices located forward in time that is perceived non-locally. The entanglement mechanism can work not only among two spatial points at the same time but also among two spatial points at different times. What does the emotion do and how does it work? It works as a "beacon" whose purpose is to alert the spirit, which then activates to acquire information. In making the "copy" the spirit comes in for a moment in the time point of the event which is then perceived as a premonition, attaches it to the pixels of consciousness of matter that lives at that point in time, does the copy and then send it to its memory, which then transmits it to the person's brain. As it is possible to notice both in the case of synchronicity and in the case of premonition a computer-like mechanism is invoked. The only difference with standard computers is that the transmission of information is non-local. In this context it would be interesting to ask ourselves what triggered the minds of those who invented computers and the Internet. How and where did they get the intuition so that then they revolutionized our communication system? This might be a sort of "shadow" of a mechanism that is working elsewhere, probably controlled by supernal intelligence and technology. Reverting to the issue of synchronicity, I think that certain paradoxes can be avoided by the fact that the path of events may be automatically slipped on a different timeline. By this I mean that time itself could have more than one dimension, so that if a person manages to avoid certain events that are to occur in the future or if that person is able to change the past itself through a sort of retro-causation, automatically the timeline of a person slides into another time dimension where causality is not violated. Therefore time might have more "degrees of freedom", not a single line but as many as the radii of a sphere. Then any event would become equiprobable. If we can change the future and/or the past, I believe we would plunge into a completely new dimension of time, where there is no violation of causality. At the same time, the old dimension runs its chain of events (which are inevitable only locally). I think Hugh Everett Jr.'s idea about quantum mechanics—the "many worlds interpretation"—properly applied to the theory of relativity, might also explain the issue of temporal dimensions. In such a case we would have potentially N possible fates, but when we experience them we collapse the wave function that keeps them together in a state of quantum superposition, and so we let only one of them exist in our dimension. But in other dimensions all the other possibilities (those that we do not live here) could become real as well. It is likely that we sentient beings driven by consciousness live simultaneously on multiple dimensions, not just one. But I think that the consciousness of which we are aware is normally perceivable only from the tip of an iceberg. And that tip is the dimension in  30
            <div class="page-number">Page 30 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-31">
            which we live. All the rest of the iceberg represents all the other dimensions and consciousness that dwells there. In other words, it is possible that our consciousness lives simultaneously in all the other dimensions but we are not aware of this while we are engaged in this body. Possibly, at our death, we lose the tip of that iceberg but not all the rest of the floe, until we take a new body and the "big vision" is again precluded. Sometimes,, we may occasionally visit other dimensions for a short time, perhaps while having a dream (only certain types of "dreams") or other altered states of consciousness. However, I see "time" not as the simple Minkowski cone   5   (used by Einstein in his relativity theory) with only one future and only one past along only one axis, but rather as many Minkowski cones where the axis of the cone can have all possible inclinations so that the space outside of the cone that Einstein called "absolute elsewhere" could actually be occupied by other temporal dimensions. The point here is that in fact multidimensionality is not only characterized by space, but also by "time". In this light, there might be a continuous interaction between present, past and future, through consciousness (perceived by the spirit) which has the ability to be projected anywhere. I would now like to address the topic of so called "lucid dreams". Some of us have them and they are not the same as hypnagogic and hypnopompic lucid visions. What is interesting here is that there is an impressive constancy of the "environments" (landscapes, ambient, people, objects, smells, sounds, etc.) visited during such dreams. Very often some "locations" are met recurrently in these particular dreams. The details are the same, as if these worlds were periodically revisited living intense, physical and earthly experiences. All this is far from the idea that dreaming (in particular this specific kind) is a sort of hallucination sprung from the subconscious. We should investigate more the possibility that sometimes when we dream, our consciousness—supposedly living in many dimensions simultaneously but being only conscious of the one here—wakes up in another dimension or universe. Therefore the sleep state may sometimes be the door to other realities, which we cannot perceive here. Suddenly we feel   there ... Is this a sort of psychic teleportation? Conversely we might hypothesize as well that the life we live here is perceived by us as a lucid dream from our alter ego on the other side. Physics tells us that an entanglement link may happen also between different dimensions or universes. This might regard both only consciousness/spirit and different bodies. The "Many Worlds Interpretation" by Everett, for the quantum state of a given elementary particle is extremely interesting in this regard. Standard quantum mechanics asserts that before we observe an elementary particle such particle will exist in many places simultaneously but when we observe it we will find it in only one place. This is the so called "wave function collapse", which renders only one possibility real. This is the canonical interpretation of classical quantum mechanics. But Everett's interpretation asserts that when we observe a particle the collapse of the wave function will not create only a real situation here but also will materialize all the other possibilities which anyway will become real only in other dimensions separated from ours. The term "other dimension" does not mean that no matter or body exist in such realms, but simply that reality is split into different realms made of matter of many kinds. The quantum entanglement mechanism, if applied to spirits as well as elementary particles, may be theoretically operational among many dimensions too. Let us visualize a high skyscraper made of many apartments distributed in various floors which are located one above the other, with each apartment consisting of several rooms. Imagine that the universe we live in is one of those floors, containing some apartments. Most apartments are empty, while some are inhabited, or at least a few rooms  31
            <div class="page-number">Page 31 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-32">
            of them. Thus, the floor on which we live could be compared to the Universe in which we are, the apartments representing the myriad of galaxies populating it, and the rooms of those apartments being the planets, only some of which are inhabited and few of these inhabited by intelligent and evolved civilizations. This analogy is meant to point out that the universe as we understand and know it through astronomical observations and theoretical models explaining it may not be the only possible universe. Here we have two possibilities: 1) our universe is only one of many possible universes, all immersed in that which is called "Multiverse", where not necessarily all the universes must obey the same physics or the same physical constants; 2) the four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal) in which we live are four of the many possible other dimensions. We accept these possibilities not as an exercise of imagination or fantasy, but simply because the possibility of the Multiverse has been often considered by theoretical cosmologists—for instance, cosmologist Max Tegmark has set up a real theoretical taxonomy on this issue—while the possibility of the existence of other dimensions was addressed mathematically from theoretical physics both as the "many worlds interpretation" developed since 1957 by Everett and as the much more recent theory of superstrings   6 . Let's now examine these theories. According to the first theory, it is postulated that at the time of observation in quantum physics—known as the "collapse of the wave function"—the manifestation of not one among many possible realities is allowed (i.e. the one in which we are immersed) but many. Other realities are going to be distributed in dimensions different from ours, which might be called "parallel worlds". According to the second theory, the laws of physics to be truly understood in their entirety must entail the existence of matter in the form of infinitely long and thin strings and not of point-like particles as postulated by the Standard Model for elementary particles. These strings, the different vibrations of which would give rise to various types of particles, crossing together would give rise to what are called "branes", or hyper-dimensional surfaces, through which physical laws propagate in a Universe made of 11 dimensions. According to this model, the nature of the gravitational force itself can be understood only if such a multidimensional realm is considered. If superstring theory is truly able to describe all reality (being a "theory of everything") we would perceive the whole scenario only if we manage to exist on 11 dimensions simultaneously, since, according to this theory, gravity would spread over all 11 dimensions. Clearly, superstring theory is evolving and we cannot exclude as of now that a more dimensions than 11 may eventually be postulated. But what is that other entity expected to live on all possible dimensions and not only on three plus time? I suspect that is consciousness. That's why there seems to be a strict and strange relationship between consciousness and gravity, as if what keeps matter united (gravity) is directed by something immaterial. If so, then consciousness would be related to the process of Creation I am, of course, not speaking about religious "creationism" here. After all, the same mechanism, qualitatively, occurs in the Pauli Exclusion Principle, where the coupling of twin particles (such as electrons inside the atom) in quantum states is guaranteed by a non-local process where the coupling is synchronic. In this case, too, it seems that some form of "consciousness" is the basis of what is material. If two particles are physically separated by a border through which they can never meet, what can make them interact? It might be consciousness that creates the interaction. For instance, an interaction between two consciousnesses, namely two spirits. At that point that spirit, which is intimately linked to the body of which is the main pilot, establishes instantly the connection with the other body through its spirit so that both bodies and the particles of  32

        <section id="page-33">
            which they are made experience an interaction, which in its turn permits an entanglement link. In principle, the body should be involved, because the brain, which is a part of the body, is the vector able to permit a consciousness to manifest through an orchestrated microtubule collapse according to Penrose-Hameroff theory, which is acquiring increased credibility. Alternatively the spirit may source the information directly from the other spirit (hypothesized to exist in another dimension), namely from the information that it contains, without any necessity that such a spirit sends consciously a message to the other. As I will discuss in the next sections, the non-local acquisition of information may be based on the capability of a spirit of "downloading" it from a "databank", where all the information is constantly deposited by many other spirits, and not directly sent by another spirit. This parallels an Internet website and an e-mail sending and receiving process.  33

            Chapter 8: BLH—The Big Library Hypothesis  Several theories regarding a possible link between the so called "junk DNA" and the "spirit"  are being developed according to recent studies by some biophysicists. What is of interest to  me is to try to hypothesize what is the role of the "spirit", which I substantially interpret as  the subtle vector of consciousness. I have imagined, so far only qualitatively, the following  scenario:  1.   The "spirit" is a physical and non-transcendent entity that, in form of a quantum  field, can be manifested in form of consciousness in any body that has characteristics of  quantum coherence (not only the biological brain).  2.   Its role, as the "terminal" of a big "supercomputer", is twofold: a) to work as software  of hardware called "body"; b) to collect pure information coming from both intelligence and  emotions.  3.   That information is automatically and non-locally "uploaded" on a "hard disc"  located in the quantum vacuum at the Planck scale (10 -34   cm).  How does all this work? All the thoughts and emotions are constantly non-locally  uploaded, rather like an Internet website, by every single spirit.  The information of an occurred event is "photographed" in the quantum field only when  such information contains a strong emotional content of any polarity (hate, violence, pain,  happiness, love, peace, etc.). Emotion would be considered a "strong signal". But if no  emotion exists there is no life. It is logical to think that the "cosmic database" has been  planned to record what deals with sentient life: if no emotion is associated with a certain  event it is as if that event was never lived. This strongly reminds the response of collective  consciousness recorded by the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) to highly emotional  events occurred in our world, using random event generators. Probably the cosmic recorder  is a highly evolved version of the GCP. Therefore, "emotion" would cease to belong to the  category of "sentiments" but rather it would be a true physical parameter that can be  constantly monitored.  Where does such a process occur? It simply occurs within the quantum vacuum present  inside the atoms of our body. All the atoms of matter are mostly made of pure void, where  protons, neutrons and electrons are immersed. If we hypothesize that this void is the site of  "universal consciousness"—i.e. the main source from where the quantum potential is born—  then everything coming from us goes there to be memorized through an "upload operation",  being instantly transmitted to a "Big Library". That library is not located at a specific place,  but it is everywhere in the Universe, inside the quantum vacuum itself, and all the atoms of  the Universe are immersed into it as well.  The hypothesis here is that the void contains (or is) the memory of all that which was  thought or felt during one or more lives and maybe also of what has still to happen, working  as a quantum supercomputer collecting information acquired by the living beings: all this  can be potentially downloaded too (see Fig. 4). The Big Library is pure information. If  information directing the orchestra doesn't exist the Universe would have no reason to exist  as well. A vehicle cannot exist without its designer. That designer is information (maybe  conscious to be such, at some circumstances), and such information is hypothesized to be  received/transmitted in a non-local way and constantly located in the quantum vacuum. It  is inside the atoms of the keyboard of the computer on which I am writing right now.  34

            Figure 5.   Simultaneous upload and download of information between a spirit and the Cosmic Big Library.  In principle, this information cannot be lost or degraded as it is not subject to the rules  of entropy   7 . I think that information, due to its very nature, is not subject to degradation, as  information is not energy but rather the "pilot of that energy". Information is not like the  shock wave of a supernova that after 40.000 years stops its expanding motion in a semi-  static nebula, or like the light of a flashlight that is always on and that after some hours  fades and turns off due to batteries consumption, but rather "propagates", namely "exists",  due only to non-local processes. Information behaves in this way for the simple reason that  it is neither matter nor energy, but rather a sort of "informed consciousness" permeating  always the Universe and the Multiverse. As I already hypothesized that the spirit is  information as well, the spirit too cannot be lost. And at the same time the spirit works as a  receiver of other information coming from the Big Library.  But let's see for a moment an illuminating example: the population of the Dogon in Mali  in Africa. Without using any telescope they predicted the existence of Sirius-B, a companion  of the famous star Sirius-A, which was discovered to be a double (maybe triple) star system  by astronomers several decades ago, but much after Dogon's claims on Sirius' binary nature.  Of course such a discovery can be done only if powerful telescopes are used. But the Dogon  had, and still have, a purely tribal and primitive culture where technology is non-existent.  How were they able to discover this? The first hypothesis that comes to mind is that their  shamans were able to connect to the Big Cosmic Library only using their mind and  consciousness and not by entering in direct contact with alleged extraterrestrials who taught  them all this knowledge as supposed by the believers of the paleoastronautics theory.  And yet the Dogon had "seen"—but not scientifically understood—that Sirius-B too  exists and that it is a dense and small star that modern astronomer call a "white dwarf".  Concerning the "Oannes" amphibious beings of which the Dogon speak a lot in their tales it  is possible that they have perceived, through the non-local information coming from the Big  Library, the effective existence of some intelligent alien civilization living somewhere, but  maybe not in the Sirius system (where the possibility of life is remote). After perceiving it in  the course of their tribal/shamanic rituals, they might have connected two different pieces  of information by attributing to both of them the same origin, so giving to the entire story a  personalized interpretation.  The point here is that they perceived some information from somewhere else. This  would let us suggest that the existence of the Oannes too might be true somewhere, but  surely not as a possibility of their alleged past visitation of Earth. Some petroglyphs, which  can be found everywhere in the world due to some indigenous and aboriginal culture, show  intriguing paintings depicting alien beings and even their alleged spacecrafts and airships.  Did aliens really visit Earth or are those paintings a plain representation of the visions and  lucid dreams experienced by such populations, who were able to connect non-locally to  some database? Here, of course, the question should be: how did they receive such  information so clearly? This also seems to point towards the Big Library Hypothesis.  The multidimensional Universe in which we are immersed might be an  incommensurable work of engineering/informatics, a creation by another intelligence, a  highly evolved one. Within such a purely hypothetic scenario, creation of Universes made of  matter would be carried out by inflating virtual particles   8   located inside the quantum  35

            vacuum: this would bring to many Big Bangs. If the "creators" are able to tap energy from  the quantum vacuum then they have also surely learnt how to get and enter information  inside it by manipulating the quantum foam   9   at will. They might use it in order to program  and create a fluctuation that evolves by inflating and then creating another universe which  might be ruled by physical laws and constants different from the ones of our universe and  where the mechanism of Life is better designed.  Many of these universes might be simply failed attempts. However, others might be  alternative creations, where Life and intelligence dwell in bodies totally different than the  biochemical one that we know here. The fact that there may be many universes could be the  sign of a parallel sequence of attempts to search for the optimal solution in order to find the  physical regimen that works best. Obviously, this can be deducted from experiences with  the duration of the order of 10-20 billion years. In principle, once one becomes aware of  what universe is the best, then only one is taken and the others are disregarded or even  deleted. I would like to put myself in the shoes of God, or of the most advanced Builders. All  that which is "real" in each universe would remain non-locally connected to the original  source through the quantum potential.  Such engineering, involving both real matter and consciousness, might come from what  I like to hypothetically call: "The Builders". But calling them "Gods" would certainly  diminish the "asymptotic" and unknowable concept of "God". Why do I need the existence  of builders in order to explain the nature of the Universe? The answer is that everything of it  as it emerges from our knowledge of physics and biology looks to be an intelligent and not  casual design. This can be immediately deduced, for instance, from the architectural marvel  of the Pauli Exclusion Principle and from the physical constants that seem to be fine tuned  to permit the occurrence of Life and intelligence within it.  At the same time, much of this Universe is far from perfection, especially when we look  at the phenomenon of Life in its innumerable forms: many of them look to be mere  attempts to make something harmonic and tending to perfection but never reaching it. The  Universe doesn't seem at all the work of a perfect God, but rather the result of the  experiment of super-intelligent children playing with Lego bricks. For who is able to observe  it, this Universe oozes intelligence but not perfection and order. Is this an atavistically  ancient experiment that was then abandoned? Or is it constantly improved with "creative  updates"?  I am tempted to think that, at the beginning, only emptiness existed. Suddenly "Lux  Fuit". But, to make sense of this sudden creation, it is necessary to conceive a sort of pre-  existing consciousness that is sometimes dormant and sometimes awake—consciousness  located in the cosmic void. This would appear to be much like the creation of consciousness  moments in our brain according to Penrose-Hameroff's theory on quantum brain before  and after the orchestrated OrchOr collapse occurs. So, why that cosmic consciousness  wanted to suddenly create the matter realm, generating a Big Bang event, for instance?  The answer might be this: probably to be aware of itself. In fact, as in the quantum  brain, a neural correlate (the brain) is necessary in order that consciousness is able to  manifest. In any fact it is not necessarily true that during the "void phase" what we call  "God" was intelligent, but rather it was so only in its potential state. Probably Creation is the  necessary path for God to be aware of himself. But this corresponds strictly to the collapse  of the wave function uniting all the microtubules in our brain: it is the same mechanism,  even if on a much wider scale. The processes occurring in the quantum brain when  consciousness moments are formed seem to be self-similar to the creation of the universe,  as a unique choice out of many possibilities superposed together in a quantum way before  something triggers the collapse of the wave function.  Probably the creative act of the "mother of all universes", i.e. of the Prime Universe, in  reality has been an instinctive and ineluctable act like a sneeze would be. This would be due  36
            <div class="page-number">Page 36 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-37">
            not to an external will but rather to a mere physical mechanism, in the same way in which  our brain experiences one million consciousness moments every day. The act of Creation in  the Universe is probably only one out of many, maybe infinite creation moments  corresponding to the manifestation of consciousness. But the act of consciousness, on a  wide scale, needs an evolutionary time in order that a "Grand Design" starts to unfold.  At this point the act of "Builders" or "Creators" (or "Servants of God"?) becomes  necessary in order to organize the process in an ordered and automated way. The builders  continued to carry out the creation work, simply as mere "facilities" that spontaneously  were born from the original source, like intelligent sculptors working on the rough stone. In  order to do that creators had to be necessarily intelligent and conscious of what they were  doing: only scientific and technological evolution of civilizations in the universe can  accomplish all this. So the builders have allowed God to take more and more self-  consciousness. In such a way intelligent creatures in the universe are useful to an  intermittently dormant God in the same way in which we need a mirror to see our face:  otherwise we couldn't see our appearance. They are the mirror of God. At the present time—  if this is the ongoing mechanism—looking at a mirror God would see a bearded and  uneducated being even if already conscious.  Maybe after some billions years God will have shaved, cut hair and cared mustache: in  short, he will like himself more than now. The full consciousness of God might occur only  after many billion years, even if it is potentially infinite. This evolution may necessarily  occur only after a long-dated action by the builders is carried out, using their science,  technology, art and humanities. The birth of builders in the Universe occurs due to a sort of  software command, maybe created by God himself in previous historical eras of the  Universe or in parallel universes where he is still conscious of himself.  Why thinking of an intelligence of "creators"? The answer is simple: a Universe made of  a continuous interplay between matter/energy and consciousness—according to the  hypotheses that have been amply discussed here—must have a form of intelligence, a higher  level of intelligence of which mental intelligence is only a servant of a bigger consciousness.  Consciousness would be the true intelligence and would constitute the brain of the octopus,  while rational intelligence would be represented by its tentacles. It is logical to think that if a  Big Cosmic Library exists, that one is a "non-local informatics infrastructure" or facility that  has been built by a refined intelligence. The goal? A universe without a memory of what  happened in it and in its living beings would be a useless one if the mechanism of Life  weren't triggered by a form of consciousness.  Therefore, Life doesn't make any sense if it is not conscious of itself. The realm of  matter/energy can be described mathematically by the laws of physics: that is the language  with which the universe is written and human crucial scientific discoveries eliminate any  doubt about the objectivity of science in describing material reality. The birth of science in  human society was a necessary step towards evolution, and intelligence is a part of  consciousness. Nevertheless, even an atheist, reflecting on the harmony and precision with  which the entire universe is constructed, would doubt that all that which exists was born by  chance. But at the same time there is no necessity to invoke a God for all of this. God is a  sort of unreachable "asymptote", which is of no interest to science: maybe it is for  mathematics when the zeroes and infinities are considered. But there is no physical  framework in the idea of God, which can be conceived only by faith but not by science.  It is much easier and logical to think of exogenous intelligent beings that learnt to do  things that we do not know yet. We have seen that some findings of quantum mechanics,  especially non-local phenomena, have suddenly opened a new door to our understanding of  the Universe. The "consciousness factor" emerges in some equations (such as Bohm's one),  and it doesn't appear at all to be something transcendent. Equations where the quantum  potential is present show a true mechanism and not a "transcendent spirit" inside matter.  37

            Consciousness is pure information. If matter is not informed everywhere and at every time  by a sort of "director" that matter is dead and useless.  This would be exactly like a computer without an operative system and software to run  on it, or like an airplane without a pilot. The perfection of the constants of Nature tells all  scientists that those constants have been fine-tuned in order to allow the existence of reality  as we know it. Similarly, the harmonic and rigorous way in which the Pauli Exclusion  Principle is constructed at the atomic level allows us to perceive material reality in its  volumes and shapes. All this cannot be considered the result of mere chance, and at the  same time it is not a proof of the existence of "God" but rather simply of an "intimate  intelligence" in Nature starting from the smallest bricks of which it is constituted.  All this said it is impossible not to think that other civilizations might have reached an  evolutionary peak such that it allowed them to build up a technology able to control all the  information flowing in the Universe through its living intelligent beings. The best way to  gather information is doing this using both intellectual and emotional data, so that anyone  can justifiably connect to them at any time. According to this hypothesis, the mechanism is  conceptually identical to the Internet, and all the living beings in the universe are expected  to be non-locally connected even if they are not aware of this. Such mechanism would be  harmonious and work in form of a two-ways process: a being that, unconsciously, connects  to the Big Library automatically uploads her/his informative baggage and at the same time  downloads some information from the available data bank.  How would the information be chosen? This would happen due to a process that is  similar to physical resonance: as soon as one has an instinctive need of something he/she  spontaneously connects with the part of the Library (some specific book, or specific book  pages) having a qualitative affinity with that specific need. Then sudden, often lucid,  thoughts appear in the mind in form of images or "icons": this often happens in the course  of hypnagogic or hypnopompic visions and/or during "lucid dreams". I think that such kind  of vivid mental information can also be sent deliberately by other intelligences just at the  times in which they sense some need coming from us. The mechanism might work in a way  that such visions are conveyed from the quantum vacuum (Planck field) as fluctuations of  the void itself and its foam (see Fig. 5). The information is encoded and impressed on the  virtual particles born there, in the same way in which we impress information on the chips  of our computers by modulating a sequence of 0 and 1 in form of Bits of information. Such  virtual particles are then induced into an entanglement state with our mind/consciousness.  I have no doubts that the information deposited in the Big Library may be of symbolic  content and/or rational, in a way that it is suitable to our perception and understanding.  That Library is made of multi-storey shelves and we human "little people" can reach its  lower floors so that we can get to take the "book" or specific pages that are of interest for us.  Also I believe that the software constituting that library is equipped with an (alerting, in  case) system able to control our own software and hardware (and of every other being in the  universe) before permitting to anyone the access to the information.  To make an analogy with the Internet run on our computers I can make now this  example: we cannot access to a certain web page if we do not have   Adobe Flashplayer  software installed on our PC. Yet, even without that software, we can access other kinds of  web pages that are suitable to our hardware and software. Thereby everyone of us sentient  beings in the universe places her/his own abilities, but due to merely technical reasons we  would be excluded from information for which we are not (yet) prepared, not having the  necessary software/hardware for it. Maybe who has a "pure heart", together with a high  intelligent quotient, has the right to access to all the shelves of such Library and the science  it constitutes.  So, at each connection there is a simultaneous upload and download of information, as  a kind of "system of communicating vessels" (see Fig. 5). This might be surely the most  38

            efficient way in the Universe in order to diffuse and share knowledge and understanding,  and maybe Love too. Evidently, intelligence alone is not sufficient to get access to the  Library, as it is only the arm of consciousness. Therefore I should conclude that—except for  possible "hackers" who sometimes are able to penetrate improperly—the only beings who  are able to absorb (and digest) true science from the Planck Field are creatures who are  extremely evolved spiritually too and not only intellectually. I see the Planck Field—  underlying the Big Library (see Fig. 6)— as an immense "consciousness ocean".  But this is not a religious conception (if anything, it might correspond to Buddhism)  because I think that a sublime intelligence is working there, an intelligence able to turn such  "ocean" into "active consciousness" in a pretty technological sense. In such a way the Planck  Field becomes the "control room". Obviously in order to reach this level of understanding  and knowledge a superior knowledge of Physics Laws is needed, in particular of quantum  physics and most of all of the way in which matter (and energy correlated with it) is  interlaced with consciousness directing it. The superior beings who guide all this are  hypothesized to operate on The Field, by being able to program the fluctuations of the  quantum foam at will and using them both as a storage of information and as a way to  create animate and inanimate matter.  In general, which modes are operational when a connection with the Big Library is  activated? So far I can hypothesize two ones: a) an "instinctive" and spontaneous mode; b) a  markedly concrete and scientific mode that can be reproducible at will. Let's see such modes  more in detail.  Figure 6.   The concept of a Big Cosmic Library.  A—In the first case I think it is possible (very probable indeed) that a person is able to  tune her/his own mind/consciousness with such superior dimensions and so to gain access  to this kind of information, but without any possibility to record anything that can be  revised at will on a computer screen, for instance. This mode is of emotional kind and  relates to the intimate sphere of the individual, but this information is not quantitatively  shareable with others and/or repeatable under an accurate control: therefore such  information is not scientifically treatable. I still think that this kind of access, although  being non-recordable (but only narrable), may operate not only emotionally but also at the  mind level—passing to it from the subconscious—where the mind would be literally  triggered or "turned on".  At this point the mind itself would elaborate the acquired information in order to  transform it into something concrete. I believe that it is exactly in this way that great  39

            scientists were able to realize their great discoveries. The root of geniality is probably based  on the capability to connect to an informative source of high level. The same concept is valid  for great artists, musicians, literati and poets. This way to connect to a "field" may turn on  the genius in some persons but it lies in the people themselves to learn to consciously  decode this information and to make a constructive use of the acquired information.  Otherwise this experience would become more or less a "trip a-la Timothy Leary" and this is  not only useless but can even estrange persons from reality as when using drugs.  Instead, using this specific mode, the only access to such superior or sublime  information—i.e. the Big Library (some mystics call it "Akasha")—that makes sense is the  constructive one, namely the one able to animate great scientists, artists, writers, poets and  perhaps even mystics. In conclusion, the reason of accessing to this kind of information is  that of using it (after decoding it from the unconscious to the conscious) in order to create  things in our own reality. In any fact, according to this access mode it is like when persons  (or whoever else in the universe) connect with an Internet website without any chance to  save the page to share with others. Therefore, it is obvious that this mode has both an  emotional impact and a power of intellectual stimulation, but nothing more than that.  B—In the second case—which is the one of greatest interest—it is potentially possible to  extract scientific information in a way that is shareable and repeatable by anyone having the  right tools and the gray matter to know how to analyze the data that may emerge. Here I  refer to the NLSETI (Non-Local SETI) technical procedure (which will be discussed in detail  in a subsequent chapter), whose purpose is not just the one of communicating with beings  smarter and older than us, but rather the one of learning how to get—thanks to the rational  work of "librarians"—information quantifiable through precise data.  These data can be potentially extracted by analyzing the "noise" of the brain waves (of  all waveforms: Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta) using a mathematical algorithm (such as the  Fourier transforms) identical to the one used by the standard SETI Project   10 . Meticulously  coded signals may be found inside such "noise" and once decoded they could disclose  extremely elaborate information within them, coming right from the "cosmic library"  through the intermediary of highly advanced beings.   This would be material deliberately  sent through the mechanism of quantum entanglement to all the sentient beings in the  universe that are able or suitable to receive it. This communication technique would work  exactly like a "lighthouse" that is signaling the location of the port to the ships away from it.  The purpose of such beings (by hypothesis) is not only to facilitate access but also to  allow other sentient beings to record data directly by analyzing quantitatively the  brainwave.   Inside these possible signals, decodable analyzing brainwave using EEG monitoring   11 , there might also be information telling us how to respond to that "message" in an appropriate way, and other information of purely scientific and technical nature that could tell us how to extract energy and/or information from the quantum vacuum and how to stimulate or activate it. But there we might also find the "instruction guide" on how to get a systematic access to the Big Library and even on how to build a "machine" interfaced with the human brain able to control systematically the entire process. There must definitely be a machine or a specifically devoted instrument working both as a "controller" and an "amplifier" of the process. Someone surely has this machine elsewhere and definitely uses it (mankind does not have it yet). My guess is that the plans of this machine may have been written inside some kind of structured NLSETI signal, or perhaps "carved" into the DNA itself (in fact, even the DNA might be monitored to look for NLSETI signals). We just have to search for it. The idea that possible alien messages may be sent to the human DNA was ventured in the past by physicist and author Paul Davies, while the idea of searching for signals inside the human brain comes from physicist Fred Thaheld. Thinking about the "DNA option" the first thing that comes to my mind is biophotons which, as it was proposed by Popp's and Gariaev's  40
            <div class="page-number">Page 40 of 109</div>

        <section id="page-41">
            studies, are the markers of DNA, which uses biophotons to inform the cells of the human body about a sort of "hologram" regulating biological functions using a biophysical mechanism. At this point I am wondering if an intelligence coming from elsewhere, using non-local methods through such hologram, has been able to modulate biophotons in frequency, intensity and time (of pulses of radiation) by acting directly on the human DNA. There is no doubt anyway—and this is the good scientific news—that biophotons can be accurately measured using photomultipliers (most often used in astronomical photometry using a resolution of one nanosecond too) by studying their time trend. Maybe the coded information eventually found in biophotons might be rebuilt in the form of a hologram, due to the strong quantum coherence of biophotons seeming to work as a Laser. And let's not forget that the DNA is also suspected to be the main intermediary between the body and what we call with the name of "spirit".  In conclusion, searching for these non-local messages both in the brainwave and in the DNA we might find crucial information that might also furnish to us the key to know who we are and what is our role in the Universe. For example, in the famous movie "Contact" SETI radio telescopes discover intelligent ET signals allowing the main character (interpreted by actress Jody Foster) to build a sort of spacecraft able to jump from one dimension to another. Analogously NLSETI signals might contain both the plans for a similar spacecraft and the plans to build a machine able to permit the brain to connect at will to the Big Library. In few words, this possibility, dealing with plans to build both a "mental radio" and a vehicle, would involve the acquisition of information non-locally and the way to be able to move through spacetime from a point to another of the Universe. I am sure that such plans exist indeed and are written inside the Big Library, and that our brain (at particular conditions) is able to download such information. But maybe the original controllers have put a "lock" in order to prevent the access to who might use such data with negative intentions. Probably such intentions are non-locally measurable by who is able to manage and control the flow of this kind of data. An intention should correspond to a specific emotion which in its turn must correspond to a specific shape of the brainwave. After all, we already have the lie detector at our disposal, so we cannot even imagine what others may have in order to monitor our intentions. If someone is able to connect non- locally with the Big Library then the Big Library itself should be able as well to do the same with him. In such a way download of information would be allowed only to whom shows the correct brainwave. I believe that all of this hypothesis can be scientifically provable or rebuttable, and if it is then proved then it can be explained in great detail.  In few words, the acquired information using the discussed method might constitute a  sort of "guide" or instruction to proceed: a sort of cosmic "Rosetta Stone".   All these are  exactly the data that would make this information scientifically and quantitatively  examinable. I am more and more convinced that, using this technique, we will arrive much  earlier to the result than using the traditional strategies of SETI based on electromagnetic  waves. Standard SETI methodologies and protocols are rigorous of course, but they are  limited by two main factors: light speed and close mind.  Reasoning now even more on the "mental images" (possibility A discussed before), we  should say that probably many of them are not important per se, but may work as a pre-  programmed trigger system able to turn on cerebral processes that might activate the left  brain (intuition aimed at scientific or linguistic understanding), the right brain (intuition  aimed at art or visual/spatial knowledge) or both. To make an example taken from  computer science, it would be similar to when we download a zip file then unzip it: the zip  file is the received mental vision (a face, a landscape, whatever having often a symbolic  41

        <section id="page-42">
            meaning) while the group of files resulting from the unzipped file is that which activates  (without being the perceiver aware of it) processes in the brain.  I believe that the same mechanism may occur with crop circles. The symbolic drawings  that are depicted there are probably not an information per se but rather a "trigger  mechanism" planned to stimulate some cerebral and/or emotional processes in our  mind/consciousness. It is not important at all if the origin of crop circles is human or not,  but rather the meaning of the depicted symbols. This, I think, is the power of symbols, being  kind of "actuators" of some process inside us both as individuals and as a collectivity.  Coming back to the mental images hypothetically taken non-locally from the Big Library,  they may be important per se, sometimes, and probably our rational brain knows  instinctively if they are images significant per se or rather zipped files (i.e. icons pre-  programmed to activate a program). If we didn't have a spirit (with that specific informative  role) such a process of information downloading/uploading wouldn't occur at all, because  we wouldn't be consciously sentient but rather robots or drones.  Let's get more in-depth with the role of symbols in human consciousness. Of course we  are not interested in the sensations that a symbol may trigger in our psychology but rather  to verify if that symbol is able to trigger something that is physically measurable. For  instance we might show several symbolic figures to persons and then see if and how the  frequency, the amplitude and the duration of a biophotonic pulse from their body changes.  This is not at all a passive use of "radionics" but rather biophysics, as we are interested to  verify if symbols are able to exert some effect on matter, namely the human (or maybe also  animal) body.  The same test could be done by measuring the brainwave using EEG. Due to these  reasons I am not authorized to exclude that a symbol of whatever nature, such as a  mandala, a holy picture, a crucifix, a particular geometric figure, or even a crop pictogram,  may affect the human being starting from its subtlest part and generating an effect in its  physical one. In fact all this can be measured accurately, and this is the main enjoyment of  science.  I would never start to do a theoretical or speculative model based on intuition alone,  because I'm sure it could take me out of the way: maybe in so doing I could deduce a  consistent pattern in itself, but not a truly realistic one. The best way to avoid this is to start  directly from the experimentation, and that comes from a purely electromagnetic  verification. There is no science without a description of phenomena in space and time, and  consequently there would be no equations to describe them.  But there can be a science that shows how events occurring in space and time are  triggered by "ideas" that are out of time and space. Just symbols may represent precisely  those ideas or those archetypes, in form of actuators/ creators working like sparkles  potentially able to turn on a fire. The best way to prove or confute this is to verify if a certain  geometric shape (or other shape) is able to affect, for instance, the time derivative of a given  physical or biophysical parameter. We can find this inside the realm of matter in which we  live, the only place where science can work. But there is no doubt that in such a way it is  potentially possible to deduce indirectly how consciousness (which is out of space and time)  is able to affect matter.  For instance, a symbol such as a mandala can be considered as an archetype of  consciousness. This may occur if we consider whatever geometric figure having a particular  (even emotional) meaning. If this is able to induce sudden variations in the flux of  biophotons or if it generates electrical signals (in the micro and nanoVolt range) inside the  noise of the brainwave then we might suspect that we are close to something extremely  important. We have to test this, starting exactly from there, using nothing but this  approach. We can't do anything else than analyzing matter and energy as dependent  variables as a function of space and time as independent variables.  42

            This method, the standard Galilean one can lead us very far away sometimes. I can  make a more stringent example. Let's suppose that a symbol—such as a spiral or a  tetrahedron—is able to heal an ill organ and that this event is repeatable at will and yet we  verify that such symbol emitted no radiation even if the healing effect always appears. What  kind of energy are we dealing with here? There seems to be no doubt: it is not Energy but  rather Information. And that information is full of meaning (positive or negative, but never  neutral) and is able to launch non-locally powerful symbolic "signals" that are able to  activate real physical and biophysical mechanisms. So, we might strongly hypothesize that  such "active information" is able to trigger precise events at the level of elementary particles  constituting animate and inanimate objects. If things are really so, then consciousness and  matter are intimately linked and the one cannot exist without the other.  If this is the true structure of reality then the non-local/acausal realm is truly stuck  inside the local/causal one and the first creates and modulates the second continuously. Of  course all of this recalls the concept of "holomovement" by physicist David Bohm, where the  implicate order of reality and the explicate order are enfolded together. It is more than  evident that if we were able to deduce a precise physical law (not only semi-qualitative as  Bohm's one) describing all of this we would then be consequently able to build a machine  able to do many (good and bad) things.  Science is the most sophisticated of human creations, but it evidently needs to mature  as there are still phenomena that we are not able to explain. In order that science can really  mature, evolve, expand it must get rid of prejudices dating back to the nineteenth century. I  believe such prejudices are one of the most important factors that have reduced our world  to its present condition.  43

            Chapter 9: A cosmic non-local threat  I have been speaking about the alleged power of symbols and a possible way to demonstrate  this scientifically, having started from the possibility that our consciousness may be able to  connect non-locally with a hypothesized Big Library, and I have concluded that this can  happen only if we have a spirit—namely a spark connecting us with a bigger light of  consciousness.  What happens when such a spirit is non-existent in several or even most persons? What  about "drones"? Why do too many people seem to have no consciousness, in spite of their  rational intelligence? Of what utility are these beings in the economy of the project of the  Universe? They might play an operational role as pure biological robots if they can be  effectively remotely controlled by some other intelligence. The only way to do this is to  replace the "spirit" with a sort of "non-local receiver" inside these beings, maybe through a  pre-designed alteration of their "soul". In such a way they could be piloted to do specific  actions, even if they would react passively without realizing what they are doing as they are  not able to decode the meaning of the issued command. Of course these beings are  spiritually dead entities: they are physical bodies plus brain, who can be used to do actions  useful to someone else in the ambit of a bigger manipulative plan originated from a totally  distorted "director".  This typology of "human beings" has nothing to do with conscious spiritual terminals  and their connection with the Cosmic Big Library. This might be a sort of genetic alteration  whose origin is still unknown to us or, alternatively, it has to do with a possible plan coming  from "predating constructors" who use non-locality (instead of electromagnetic waves) in  order to control the universe. If so, they would be a sort of "competitors for power",  compared to the other healthy ones. What best way than interfering in the Life creation  project by putting "biological robots" into action, after imitating the prime project and at the  same time by deceiving everything in a subtle manner?  Just observing many persons in this world (in comparison with others), or simply their  empty look in addition to their behavior, it is not difficult to note that, in spite of their often  attractive appearance and often high IQ, they are totally different from those who devote  their skills to others or to the search for knowledge.  Many politicians of certain parties almost always justify the negative or criminal  behavior of some persons (many of whom are true psychopaths) by asserting that that their  behavior is being dictated by some pain suffered in childhood. Statistics alone can show  clearly that this is not at all the case: other persons who have been subject to the same level  of suffering react in a totally different way. Therefore, something merely genetic and even  subtler must be in action here.  But genetics is maybe only the effect of a cause, so far hidden to our science.  Considering that the spirit—being a coherent field—is supposed to be strictly linked to the  DNA, we could say that an ill, mutilated or even non-existent consciousness is the main  matrix of certain aberrant behaviors in our society. So what kind of spirit are some beings  supposed to have? I would guess that their spirit is an artificial device, i.e. something that is  sufficient to make a body live for only one life in order to accomplish certain tasks that are  commanded from elsewhere. I suspect that this world, at least at these times, consists of  both of human beings and human-like drones.  The second category, who sometimes are also able to reach much power in our society  thanks to their IQ, behave in reality as mere puppets who act under the command of  "someone else" but are unaware of this. By the way, what is better among the two options? A  true spirit attached to a body made of Fullerene molecules, a quantum computer or plasma,  or a false spirit attached to a body made of flesh and bones? What is the true drone here?  44

            We are dealing with empty envelopes, which someone is able to pilot non-locally at any  time, in the same way in which one is piloting and maneuvering a model aircraft. It is  sufficient to use a remote control and the model changes direction or speed and maybe it  throws swoop. The remote control here is supposed to be non-local and acting directly on  the appropriate "spirits", namely the false ones that have been designed as mere receivers of  commands coming from elsewhere. But they might be easily controlled using  electromagnetic devices too, especially if their brain can be affected.  In such a way, the hidden puppeteer puts in power who is more convenient to him and  uses the most suitable servants. But the power issue is certainly the most important one  here. Power is able to easily move politics, populism, and, most of all, pernicious forms of  socialism, often coupled with religious fanaticism. Of course, the politically correct continue  to claim that all human beings are the same as "humanity" and that whoever denies this is a  racist: in so doing they use public opinion and sentiments.  Evidently, this is a perfect way to "lock the mechanism" so that the world continues  without any significant changes towards a true evolution. Of course, such "distorted  intelligence from elsewhere" might also like to favor or trigger extremist parties with the  main intent to induce confusion in a totally uncritical society: those who claim that many  human beings are not human inside would be automatically considered "extremists", and,  conversely, true extremists would exploit in their favor this theory. There is a strategy all too  clear here.  I believe we have to reflect a lot on this thorny topic, because it is probably the focal  point of the present human collective condition. In the light of crucial knowledge we have  already acquired in quantum physics and biophysics, I am sure that science has the  capability to support us quite soon in order to solve a burning issue like that. All of this  started when the fuzzy logic of quantum mechanics was discovered, in particular when the  mechanism of non-locality was subsequently extended to our consciousness too, about  which important studies are going on although with all the appropriate cautions that are  required by the scientific method.  In this light, it is easy to understand that the entanglement mechanism can be used in  many ways: good ways as in the case of the information exchange between human spirits  and the Big Library, and bad ways as in the case of the possibility of non-locally piloting  false spirits and their underlying bodies. I think that the second mode might have been  designed with specific goals by altering the original project, and this is plainly evident if we  look at some statistics regarding human behavior in our society. It is impossible to dismiss  the entire problem by asserting that all this occurs by chance or due to the collapse of moral  values because of a too fast diffusion of technology. It is not so difficult to observe that the  actions produced by most of these false spirits (the mightiest and their servants) are merely  directed to evil goals—and not only vague "materialism"—which almost always result in  wars, crimes against mankind, exploitation of peoples and causing of hunger in the world.  The brain of all this seems to have several tentacles, the most important of which maybe  are five: the way in which money is managed and diffused, political ideologies of every color,  religious fundamentalism, drastic disinformation about crucial issues (such as UFOs, for  instance), discredit politics against those who want to offset the black curtain in order to  make clarity. They are all efficient systems to guide most people like sheep. So the best  strategy is inevitably the one of preparing the appropriate persons to lend themselves to this  staging. Who better than false spirits can do this? And what about the puppeteer?  This superior entity—let's call him "Mr. X"—might also operate by triggering,  momentarily blocking or blinding the human brain (including the one belonging to true  spirits) using properly modulated electromagnetic waves and/or magnetic fields. After all  the notorious "MK Ultra" 12   project was supposed to work in this way too. Who induced  scientists and technologists to manipulate the human brain and/or affect the cells of the  45

            human body by using electromagnetic devices? In any fact we have at our disposal all the  technological sensors to prove or disprove this hypothesis.  If this hypothesis is true then we may have been surrounded for hundreds of years by a  scary hidden reality that wants to prevent the true spirits from experiencing the marvels of  cosmic memory—namely their true nature. Science, and only science, can help us rend the  black veil that hides this. And probably we should use more or less the same tricks used by  Ulysses when he was able to defeat Polyphemus inside the cave. After all, epics, legends and  maybe also tales had the main scope of communicating to us some important truth using an  often symbolic language.  Therefore none can exclude that someone else has distorted the original plan for Life  and Creation, which was that a body and its mind have to be equipped with an independent  free spirit controlling them, and at the same time with a non-local informatics system able  to put a sentient being in contact with the entire universe exactly in the same way in which  the universe itself is structured starting from elementary particles (the Pauli's Exclusion  Principle is an illuminating example), where reality is made both of an explicate and an  implicate order, according to Bohm theory.  Such a weird scenario cannot be excluded and avoiding talking about it makes the  problem worse. Why? Because it is sufficient to see how the world goes on this planet to  realize that much doesn't work in the correct way: many, too many, negative events occur  due to beings that are totally without spirit. We have rich statistics both spatially and  historically about this phenomenon. Some sort of "virus" seems to affect humanity since  ever, maybe more at these times. Religions call this "Satan", but science could unmask this  highly manipulative intelligence that is surely able to manipulate the human DNA too and  its connection with what we call with the name of "spirit".  Of course, the impossibility for the "human" drones of acquiring information from the  Big Library is the best way to produce useful servants, including surely some "idiot savants".  The details of the project are obviously unknown to us, but, certainly, such a black design is  aimed at the control of the Universe after violating the original project. One would be  tempted to think that only one sentient superior being—let's call him "Lucifer"—is  controlling, or non-sentient mechanically minded drones created by him to mutilate the  potentialities of true human spiritual beings. This is a hypothesis to be tested.  The world "Lucifer" doesn't mean at all the atavistic figure of monotheistic religions. It  might be a refined intelligence coming from another dimension, which has created a  technology of mind manipulation and maybe of space exploration too. This would explain  why this world is full of violence, struggles for power, wars and more. The intent of such a  hypothetic evil and cynical entity is obviously not related with the project of a Big Cosmic  Library  But, in the light of this—obviously still undemonstrated—hypothesis, it is important to  be able to answer to this question: why only a few people are able to connect to the "field" or  to be conscious of it while others don't? It is logical to think that if a cynical intelligence  wants to control and exert its power on our world (and other worlds as well) it will do so  following in a parallel way this procedure: 1) by attempting to "blind" those who are  potentially able to perceive the information from the Big Library; 2) by creating a different  "typology" of human beings who being human only in physical and intellectual appearance  are totally devoid of the capability to connect to the Big Library; 3) by manipulating the  human DNA acting on its junk component and changing the spiritual matrix that was  originally designed as a "stereo-receiver" of the Information from the Big Library into a  "mono-receiver" of the non-local commanding signals sent by this distorted intelligence.  Our world, our society, our history speaks clearly: too many persons evidently have no  conscience, don't realize the evil they do, despite their brain-like (mechanical) intelligence.  46

            These beings should be identified through a better knowledge of their DNA. We need to  know precisely their biophysical markers, maybe studying also the behavior of the  biophotons emitted by their body since their childhood and/or better studying their  brainwave.  Of course none has the right to interfere or hurt the life of an individual made of flesh  and bones (even if without a true spirit), and so able to feel pain. Life is precious in all its  forms and must be respected. But science has the right and the duty to monitor the entire  situation, in order to search for a solution to the problem when future generations are  involved, by letting certain individuals live all their life until the end and in tranquility but  also making sure they do no harm to our society.  If the "satanic side" of this general hypothesis (dealing with another form of non-local  connection via mind/consciousness) is true, it is not difficult to understand the strategy of  "Mr. X". Blocking any information—as a true censorship—from the Big Library and creating  a large number of drones to perpetrate through them his plans means Total Power for him  and a perfect control of planet Earth and its resources. Of course a penetration strategy  might be carried out directly and physically too, using "legions" able to interfere with us, our  physicality and its DNA. This might maybe explain the "abduction phenomenon" if this is  the real cause. I'll speak even more about this controversial issue by presenting alternative  hypotheses too.  Religions are irrational in their dogmatism and a matter of pure faith but Science  cannot ignore so easily some atavistic figures depicted in the ancient holy texts. The  recurrence in all religions of "Mr. X" must be considered by social scientists too, because  what is generally considered as a symbol might be a true but totally unidentified entity.  Also, science can make unexpected discoveries studying better the human DNA and the way  in which it can be manipulated in order to break the links with the "Big Source", having in  mind that such a source is not a "holy thing" but rather a marvel of "quantum informatics  engineering" aimed at harmony, perfection, order and justice.  It is maybe possible to imagine a scenario that evolved through the times. A highly  evolved intelligence of "constructors" built up a cosmic supercomputer designed to makes  sure that all intelligent beings connected to source through a sort of "coherent field" or  "engine" called "spirit" are able to evolve in order that the Universe and its project of Life  can progress toward perfection.  But at a certain time during the cosmic era another intelligence of constructors was  born, aimed at violating the original project of Life and its connection with all the rest of the  Universe. The goal of the first intelligence is that all the living beings in the Universe are  God, while the second (distorted) intelligence wants only one entity to exist as "God" with  all other entities reduced to his useful sheep. Yet there is no God in either case, but rather  two different technologies and strategies—at least according to the hypothesis I am  venturing here. There is no doubt that all this is a realistic (and not religious) version  showing the rebellion by Lucifer against the original holy design.  True God, as a mathematical asymptote is intellectually and scientifically incognizable.  Only those who have a faith can perceive this absolute entity. But scientists are not  interested in this: they are devoted to exploring the nature of reality and to solving  problems of whatever nature.  Maybe in the Universe a huge and subtle war has gone on since time immemorial.  Science advancement in this (apparently) weird topic means understanding the way in  which matter and consciousness are related in the physical sense. But, at a certain point, a  crossroads could be reached which imposes a crucial choice: do we want a Universe of sheep  or a synchronous Universe of sentient beings participating with a Unity aimed at a higher  syntropic and not entropic evolution?  47

            To conclude this section, I express a doubt about my own hypothesis by asking a final  question. Are the "bad guys" and their drones the result of an "agreement" with the "good  guys" in order to temper mankind through suffering?  48

            Chapter 10: The evolution of the Grand Design  It is logical to think that the prime true engineers and designers of the Universe have been  working and are continuously working in order that information is not overshadowed or  lost. It is then obvious that it is inevitably necessary that the "correct receivers" exist in  order to perceive that prime information. Otherwise all that which was created would be  only a surrogate. I believe that the prime authentic project is never lost, anyway. Also I  think that the concept of entropy is only locally true in our Universe: if the energy and the  ordered state of the explicate realm of the universe tends to be extinguished, then its  informative content must be necessarily maintained in the implicate realm, all this thanks  to the "original quantum information project".  There might be, at a multimensional level, a general physical law according to which all  the information is conserved. If I take a balloon and squeeze it on one part it shrinks, but it  must necessarily zoom on another part, otherwise the balloon explodes and ceases to exist.  That's the reason why the laws of existence must be necessarily "elastic" in order to allow  survival and evolution. I think this is the true law of conservation, dealing not only with the  mass and the energy in our universe but also with the informative processes linking the  material realm with the cosmic consciousness directing it: nothing can be really lost, thanks  to the existence of other universes and dimensions.  I think that if a form of "control" of the quantum vacuum and its virtual particles didn't  exist then the universe wouldn't exist as well or would extinguish very soon. Due to this  reason the quantum vacuum must necessarily be the mind of the universe, being able to  propagate non-locally information to matter particles everywhere, and sometimes to create  new matter when it is necessary (see Fig. 7).  Figure 7.   The role of virtual particles in the quantum vacuum in affecting non-locally real particles of our universe and inducing them in a condition of entanglement, using a sort of "triangulation".  In the software of a computer and/or its operative system, it is possible to make  changes to an original program or even insert a Virus in order to damage or pilot that  program in a way that it is different than the one for which it was designed. Analogously, if  some intelligence were able to interfere in this way with the cosmic software of the Universe  it might be possible to insert some variations inside the several coexisting material realities,  using the mechanism of quantum entanglement actuated by some "control room". I would  49

            like to hope that some kind of "Cerberus" guards the palace entrance very carefully... like  our   Norton Internet Security   does when we want to protect our computer from possible  external attacks.  On the other side, it might also be possible that well-meaning modifications to the  original plan or non-local software can be done by any intelligence in the Universe able and  allowed to intervene. This would deal with maneuvering the Planck Field in order to change  the project that is the basis of matter-energy located at a precise point in space-time, and  working with virtual particles in the same way in which a meticulous goldsmith is able to  expertly handle the gears of a clock and its small screws. This is exactly the same thing—in  this case being non-local—as that which one does when remotely controls a model aircraft.  I believe that such "fine tuning" can be done by some evolved intelligence who wants to  aid the improvement of the original project, but we are not yet able to understand how to do  this ourselves (even if we sense it is possible) in a way that is not instinctive but rather born  from a full scientific understanding. In few words, someone else might be able to remotely  control the objects of Nature by acting directly on the Planck Field, where the main project  or stencil resides. If someone is able to change the prime project in order to make  improvements, updates and corrections, and if we assume that virtual particles of the  quantum vacuum are in an entanglement state with the matter objects of our universe (and  probably of others too), then it is theoretically possible to manipulate the project of Creation  by remotely controlling the objects that have already been created.  In such a way, it might be theoretically possible also to dematerialize objects or  violating for a while the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which is the main structure of matter as  we know it in its shapes and volumes. In few words, it would be possible to violate or  suspend the laws of physics. The modifications may be permanent or temporary. In the first  case we would deal with the improvement of the design acting directly on the matter objects  after sending a non-local command to the virtual particles of the vacuum that are entangled  with the particles of the objects themselves.  In the second case we would deal with some action that might be done by "others" (and  maybe by us too one day) in order to accomplish some specific tasks. In this light I think  that the Pauli Exclusion Principle may be violated. Many might claim that this is obviously  possible because matter is a pure illusion. In reality I think matter is real. The point here is  that, if this hypothesis is true, consciousness (and through it the quantum vacuum) is able  to manipulate matter in the sense that the physical laws directing it can be momentarily  suspended.  Of course, if the matter realm in which we live is the product of the builders/creators  then they are theoretically able to assemble and dismantle at will their mechano. It would be  most interesting from the point of view of theoretical physics to see what might happen if  the Pauli Exclusion Principle is violated, using a Gedanken experiment   13   that is  methodologically similar to the famous EPR one.  Let's now see why one should violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. I can offer some  examples here. Let's consider the so called "abduction phenomenon" according to which  some persons claim they are taken against their will by some alleged alien beings able to  accomplish several experiments on their body. Let's assume now that this experience is not  a hallucination but rather a real one. If so, the best way to abduct people in the most  efficient and hidden way is to enter at will everywhere. In order to do that without breaking  the walls of the rooms of a house or without forcing the front door or a window and so being  able to enter undisturbed, it would be sufficient to suspend the physical laws that are the  basis of the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Suddenly the electrons would be taken away from  their quantum states inside each atom and spread.  50

            This would be like taking socks away from the ordered drawers of a cabinet and putting  them all together inside the cabinet, but out of the drawers. In such a way it would be  literally possible to pass through walls. After accomplishing their task such visitors would go  back from where they came after activating again the Pauli Principle at the specific location  from where they entered. The new activation would be permitted simply by the fact that the  original project is not deleted at all from the virtual particles governing local matter, which  would be dismantled for a while by sending some non-local commands to make that  manipulation at a specific point of spacetime.  This would resemble someone making a hole inside a sphere-shaped object made of  non-dried clay and then reestablishing the same shape as before using the same stencil used  to make it the first time. Considering this example, it is easy to deduce that what we call  "matter" in its solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma forms is in reality plastic. And yet it must  be so, because every atom composing the objects of nature is 99% vacuum. The marvel here  is that the brain/consciousness of matter exists inside that emptiness, i.e. the quantum  vacuum. It is that same void that gives the orders non-locally to make changes in the matter  realm, as if someone has at his disposal a technology replicating on a much smaller scale  what happened during the creation of the Universe.  I just discussed something about the abduction phenomenon but I might still mention  other two examples. If the hypothesized aliens like to hide from our sight they would think  of a way to build bases underground. They might do that without using any excavator or  grinder, but rather simply suspending the laws of physics (via Pauli Principle) using the  same mode through which they operate when they penetrate inside the room of a house. Of  course all of this must be necessarily directed by a super-science that under appropriate  control conditions is able to manipulate matter (and maybe also space and time).  A second example—the one of Filipino healers—shows clearly that, when they are not  perpetrating a hoax (quite frequent among them), they are able to penetrate inside the body  of an ill person using their hands without cutting it in order to extract a cancer (for  instance). They evidently have an instinctive capability to manipulate matter by suspending  the physical laws governing it. If this is the case—as it seems to be—then this capability can  become active in some persons as an ability that is not qualitatively different from the one  of birds when they fly. Flying birds are not intelligent and don't need any scientific  knowledge to fly, but they fly indeed.  What does this last example mean? It surely means that our consciousness can at times  be able to manipulate matter in the same way in which matter can be created or destroyed.  It is now evident that if someone (such as an alien intelligence) has found a way to produce  such apparent magic under control conditions then this can come only from a science, a  physical science. A science discovered by those who want to study in-depth what happens  sometimes when consciousness becomes active with matter, not to disregarding study of  apparently "paranormal" phenomena such as Filipino healers. Not everything that  manifests is a hoax. Therefore huge advancements in science and technology may occur if  (true) rigor is combined with an open mind.  Let's now go back to the possibility of making permanent changes in the fabric of the  Universe by some intelligence. This is similar to Wikipedia, where everyone can make  modifications to the original pages. Therefore, the project of the universe might be  continuously evolving due to intelligent "designers" who try to improve the result of  creation, especially what deals with animate beings. Maybe there are probably more types of  builders sometimes competing together in this task. Nothing ever is born perfect: the  Universe is not made of an imminent and static perfection but rather of a dynamic evolution  towards perfection passing through the inevitable errors that can be done in the path. It  might be that something of what some of them created got out of hand and that they have  not been anymore able to control a sort of "chain reaction" that they themselves created.  51

            Due to this, they maybe also occasionally intervene directly on the various planets in  order to make changes in the genetics of some Life forms on various planets, in order to try  to stem the mistakes that they themselves have made. For instance, I have the impression  that on this planet there are some animals, including human beings and plant life forms,  that shouldn't exist, and yet they exist and reproduce   uncontrollably . These entities would,  in this case, not be due to the result of the work of a great manipulator but rather to other  well intentioned beings making mistakes..  Consider the mass suicide of lemmings in Norway. Is it normal that such pretty rodents  reproduce so intensively and then suddenly "mother nature" reestablishes the equilibrium  by causing mass suicide? It looks more like a project mistake. The strange thing is that this  happens also near Hessdalen, a small Norwegian valley where anomalous recurrent light  phenomena are seen often in the sky.  And then there is this madness in nature that allows all species (particularly  carnivorous) to eat each other to survive. A life project of this kind seems a mistake. A  Universe of this kind cannot have been created by "God" but rather by an intelligence of  lesser magnitude. This is an evolving universe and the intelligence therein must be subject  to evolution as well—evolution through errors.  Possibly the builders were almost perfect when they mounted the bricks of matter on  the basis of the Pauli Exclusion Principle: this seems to be the work of a refined intelligence.  In fact, when we observe inanimate matter, we can acknowledge a superb opera of both  engineering and art. But when Life enters into play, blunders are revealed, probably not due  to the cruelty or cynicism of the builders, but rather to their recklessness in their demand to  create something extremely complex.  I also suspect that such hypothesized superior beings are not satisfied with what they  created and are continuing to refine them. I think this is anyway a game of power, which is  probably the most diffused play in the Universe. Some of those who create something,  especially if their creation is magnificent, may end up (but not always) feeling like a God. In  some cases this would be a provisional God whose main intent is not to cause damage, and  in other cases this would be a "God" ruled by ego in its purest form, whose main intent is to  dominate, govern and oppress: I have already spoken written about this extreme typology.  This is what might happen on much larger scales (and dimensions of existence) as  happens in the micro scale of our own society. And that is inevitably generated by the fear of  being overwhelmed by others, an atavistic fear characterizing who—although being  technologically evolved in a disproportionate way—is truly "without God". This probably  happens, as a natural mechanism, when the connection with everything is replaced by  becoming a center of attraction.  If this interpretation is correct, then it is natural to suggest that some of such degraded  superior beings—otherwise called "fallen angels"—put the gag and straitjacket to those who  they want under their command. On a much smaller scale exactly the same thing is being  done here on Earth by all dictatorships and religious fundamentalism, like a mirror of a  distorted mechanism that is going on mainly at a cosmic level.  Also, I wonder if some of these "lords"   have induced us to create religions with the  intent to keep us "drugged and dazed at the magnificence of God": this served and serves  right now to keep us in the inaction, to prevent us from doing what they do. They are  motivated by fear in their strategies and decisions, the fear of other potentials that could  become operational and that might be directed against their own plan. So they use their  own tricks in order to subtly conspire at our shoulders, using methods that at present we do  not accept yet as science. I suspect that they have committed many misdeeds of which  mankind are not aware at all, and have also tried to weaken our brain to render any  52

            connection between the right and left hemispheres almost impossible or to deactivate some  of its functions such as the pineal gland.  Of course, this is a good method of castration along the era of human civilization, which  must proceed—but under the directives of someone else. In fact, something was allowed—  such as standard technology and informatics evolution—and something else was forbidden  and/or totally discredited at the eyes of our established science (wanted by them exactly in  its present shape) making it pass as "magic". But what is incorrectly defined as magic is  science indeed: forbidden science. And that which is forbidden is not at all synonymous  with what cannot be scientifically understood.  Sometimes I wonder why Jesus Christ finished his life nailed to a wooden cross and  with a crown of thorns on his head. Probably he, using his metaphors aimed at triggering  both our brain and our spirit, tried to tell (or remind) us that a part of creators operating on  the side of God do exist and that they are not afraid of anything, inviting us humans to have  no fear of those who try to enslave us using hypnotic methods. In the famous movie "2001—  A Space Odyssey" a voice says at the end: "All those worlds will be yours". The black  monolith of that movie represents the sign of a healthy cosmic intelligence that wants us to  develop our potential, instead of repressing it. These ones are truly evolved builders, not  only technologically. They are knights without fear and fault, who have learnt to be totally  free from their egos. Despite my agnosticism and partial atheism, here's how I see the  "Kingdom of God" of which Jesus spoke to us in his unforgettable parables.  Before continuing, let's examine an important and concrete problem. How could we be  able to demonstrate that the entire Universe (and maybe others too) and us are ruled by  superior intelligent beings? Apart from the articulated speculations that done so far, how  could we demonstrate scientifically that this is truly happening? Can we only speculate  here? Maybe not. Probably the key to the solution of this old and atavistic problem might  consist in monitoring scientifically three key objects characterizing both our life and what  surrounds us: our brain, our DNA and the sky.  In the first two cases, we could search for the signatures (respectively, brainwave and  biophotons) which might represent tracks or even relics of an external intelligence wanting  to communicate with us in order to teach us the nature of the reality that we human beings  constitute within a bigger reality surrounding us. In fact the (non-local in origin)  information that can be potentially extracted from a careful examination of the brainwave  and biophotons can lead us to the construction of a new science or however can be the root  of a drastic expansion of our science, especially physics.  Indirectly we would also have a confirmation that a superior creative intelligence exists  and tends to communicate with us continuously. Anyway, there is no doubt that the  acquisition of such new physics might be the road to our true freedom. It is not difficult to  imagine that, as in physics, we can find the "activation key" to an expansion not only of our  knowledge and understanding but of our being too. And this would inevitably occur because  in so doing we would be able to free us from the chains that blocked mankind so far inside a  stagnating marsh made of ignorance, blindness and even violence.  In a parallel way we should monitor the sky in order to verify if someone is really  visiting us but above all to deduce scientifically how those visitors are able to do that. There  are presently several ongoing projects that using astronomy-like measurement instruments  such as sophisticated cameras, spectrographs, magnetometers, spectrometers, Laser  systems and others. These enable us to obtain fully physical data that, once analyzed, might  furnish the correct answer in rigorous scientific terms. The observations done so far at  specific locations of the planet have demonstrated that some anomaly does exist in the sky,  probably of geophysical and atmospheric origin. But, at the present time, we are not yet able  to understand why it exists and how its physical mechanism works. This will be discussed  in-depth in a specific chapter of this book.  53

            Once we have done the three tests, we would have in our hands the three scientific  proofs that might lead us to find a possible demonstration of the existence of one or more  intelligence forms interacting with our world and us: signals deposited in neurons and in  the DNA and evidence of alien visitation "from outside" (it might be reductive to say: "from  space"). At the end, we might be in a condition to find out crucial correlations and finally we  would be able to solve the puzzle. I see this as the most important scientific goal that  humanity should aim for at present.  Let's imagine that we want to reach a castle placed on the top of a distant hill and that,  after a long walk, we have started to glimpse through binoculars the shape of the castle far  away. Maybe we are now at this point of the path. In fact this might be the right time in  which a new long walk towards the castle could start. This walk is obviously full of  difficulties, which must be faced without fear, as we no longer live in the Middle Ages but  during an epoch in which the second age of science has started. It is our thirst of knowledge  that drives us towards something that we are not yet able to touch.  The point is that, in this period of the human history, we are finally in a condition to  dimly see the castle. The next step will be made of strategies to reach it directly by passing  all the obstacles along the way. It might take a long time to reach but we should not be  worried. We start from the microstructures of our hard work—producing not only ideas but  concrete numerical data too. I believe that we must always have the castle in sight or the  engine idles and gasoline is wasted. I mean that before entering into action it is necessary to  be able to see the goal clearly. The engine is science and the goal maybe the highest ever.  54

            Chapter 11: The necessity of duality  Let's now argue more about the nature of possible builders/creators. Are they good or bad?  Or do both typologies coexisting in the Universe? All of this, coming from higher realms, is  reflected here in the microcosm—our society. The universe—the macrocosm—is the same.  Both large and small scales equate. This means that if we have good and the evil here, the  same must exist on a larger scale. In such a way we can hypothesize the existence of two  kinds of builders/creators who work in parallel: the good ones who have learnt to get rid of  their own ego by becoming able to glimpse the reflections of an eternal consciousness that  waits to be awakened and the evil ones who remain blind to the marvel surrounding them.  This is part of Duality, which represents what happens in our world. But, is choosing only  the good or evil the correct road towards evolution?  Let's now speak about what happens when the equilibrium between opposite polarities  in our society is suddenly broken, due to factors that we are not yet able to understand but  which might be induced by the ill-intentioned force, or the virus, of which I spoke before.  Let's first make a metaphor, looking how the balances of forces are structured in the  universe. I can mention the example of the Sun or of normal stars, which shine for billions  years without any substantial instability.  Stars shine due to a perfect equilibrium of two counterbalancing forces: the gravity  force directed inward and the pressure force of the high-temperature plasma directed  outwards (see Fig. 8). When one of those two forces fails that equilibrium is unbalanced in  favor of gravity and the star collapses on itself. This happens because the nuclear fuel  (typically: Hydrogen) ends and the available temperature in the nucleus of the star is not  sufficiently high to burn Helium (the product of Hydrogen burning). All this produces an  unbalanced situation that favours gravity. This raises the temperature and a new balanced  cycle in which Helium is burned starts, and then, again, a new cycle is activated where  Carbon is burned, until such "pulsations" are not anymore able to reestablish the balance  between the two main forces. At that point the star becomes a red giant (with a white dwarf  in the center) which later is dissipated in form of a planetary nebula.  Or, if the mass of that star is much greater than the one of the Sun the star explodes as a  supernova (with a neutron star or a black hole remnant in the center). The physical  mechanism through which stars shine shows what happens when one of the two forces fail:  in all cases more or less violent events occur. Why does the equilibrium fail? The reason is  because a stable chain of thermonuclear reactions stops.  What is the point of this stellar metaphor? To answer to this question I turn now to the  human case. What is the reason of violent acts such as wars and what kind of energy is it?  Or, which energy suddenly fails? I call it "Anergy", which manifests due to the lack of the  natural non-local link uniting humans at a subtle level. In fact the Global Consciousness  Project experiment (already mentioned) is able to measure the presence of this informative  link—when present—using random event generators. Which energy is suddenly missing  then?  55

            Figure 8.   Two examples of physical balances in the macro and micro cosmos.   Left . The equilibrium between gravity and gas pressure in the Sun.   Right . The equilibrium between negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons in the atom.  It is not energy but rather information. This information suddenly loses empathy. When  this crucial information, non-locally linking all human beings and probably animals too is  missing, then the biosphere violently reacts. Wars at all levels and probably also a  geophysical reaction from the entire planet occur, until a moment arrives in which the  endured suffering generates something able to reconnect people with superior principles  and to reestablish the normal subtle informative emotional and mental flux between  humans. So, in the specific human case, how does a lack of this "energy" cause an  unbalanced situation? Which equilibrium and which opposing forces are involved?  Probably these forces are what we call good and evil. They are not physical forces but rather  "active information", not dissimilar from the positive and negative electric charges inside an  atom (electric charges are not a physical force per se but rather can trigger the electrical  force).  Pursuing only one or the other takes us away from the laws of this universe, designed as  it was planned. It is not possible to pursue only the good or only the evil according to the  laws of this cosmic project, in the same way in which atoms cannot exist without negatively  charged particles such as electrons balanced by positively charged ones such as protons (see  Fig. 8). Both particles must exist in order to guarantee the existence of the matter realm in  this universe. It seems terrible to think that this is the ongoing law. But the physical laws of  the Universe—designed as a prime project—show alone how the situation must be inside the  realm of existence. In the same way it is necessary to accept both the good and the evil and,  above all, learn to navigate through both, but without never giving an absolute value only to  one or only to the other and without ever being emotionally or mentally involved by none of  them. Truth is much beyond the good and the evil, taken as arbitrary choices.  Concerning to the evil force, the point is that we have not to worship it (as too many do)  but use it intelligently by dominating it completely exactly as it happens in those perfectly  balanced machines called stars. Stars alone show, in the realm of matter/energy—a sort of  "shadow" of the prime mechanism of creation, which is purely dictated by harmony between  opposite forces. In fact, at the beginning of the Universe during the radiation era a  continuous annihilation between matter and antimatter was going on, until—due to a  mysterious reason that we do not know yet—matter prevailed and antimatter only  apparently disappeared. And yet it reappears all the time in a kind of "pulsating way" for a  short while in form of positrons (positively charged electrons) during thermonuclear  reactions in stars where the fusion of Hydrogen nuclei produce Helium nuclei. Without  this—causing annihilation between electrons and positrons—there would be no energy and  consequently no light from a star.  In our universe, physical laws are just the same everywhere. Practically it is like walking  on a tightrope between two buildings, learning not to fall either to the left side or to the  right side, but staying perfectly in the centre: a stable star makes exactly this. The wise man  knows that the smile and quietness dwell only in those who can walk without fear on a  tightrope between two buildings. All this is light, stable light, just like it happens in the stars  during billions years. The obtainment of such result for humans means only one thing:  enlightenment. The stars would never shine without that "dark force" that is gravity; it  seems paradoxical but it is true: there can be no pressure of external gases without the  gravity force heating them due to the effects of collisions between particles.  So, coming back to the human case, it seems that human empathy at the level of global  consciousness (namely that "informative force" mentioned before) can be established only if  such equilibrium of opposed forces is maintained. But what does this mean? It means that  56

            we do not have to be emotionally involved either by the good or by the evil, because Truth  lays probably somewhere else. Maybe wars, although atrocious, paradoxically serve for us to  wake up, until we'll have learnt how the machine truly works. Surely, "others" already know  this as a standard knowledge; we humans—except for a few spiritually enlightened  persons—do not know this yet.  But among these "others" there are also those who face in their favor such cosmic laws  in a twisted way and attempt to insert "viral information" inside the non-local software that  governs the balances in our society (in fact here I inevitably retrieve the subject of the  previous chapter). For instance, they might trigger religious fundamentalism in some  nations, favor the development of satanic sects, create false apparitions of the Virgin Mary,  take control of secret services, drive Free Masonry and Mafia towards their goals, create  "subterranean governments", or push some bankers to make crazy decisions, causing  eventual destabilization. This is just a way to control us, taking away our ability to maintain  the connection with the original law. Obviously, their deceiving information is applied using  the quantum entanglement mechanism.  I can even imagine "the others" behind a screen while they mark the locations to haunt:  but this is not much different from Voodoo. In few words, programming the non-local  computer conveying this kind of information in the mind of many persons is exactly the  same action as inserting a pin on the photograph of a person. Differently from the tribal  method that everyone knows, the "others" might have made a science of all this, and more  precisely, a military science and an attack strategy in all senses. I am tempted to suspect  that such a mechanism is going on in order to attempt to destroy or drastically reduce our  collective equilibrium. Maybe just the "junk DNA" would be the zone where they would  insert their "Voodoo pin" in form of an unthinkable technology. If we put ourselves in the  twisted cloths of certain gentlemen we might expect that it would be sufficient to hit here  and there a bit of people with the final goal of creating a network connected by  entanglement which then does all the rest. I think that's like cutting electric cables of an  electronic device, so that the energy does not flow anymore. Substantially this would be  viral information and/or viral suppression of previous information whose purpose is to  block or destroy the correct information taking up the various human societies.  This would be exactly like a computer virus   that is designed to destroy all the data or the  entire hard disk of a computer, just in form of information that destroys other information.  This informative sabotage would result in a break out of wars in the world, due to the lack of  that "informative energy" uniting non-locally the human biosphere. This "informative  anergy" would trigger a form of violent energy, which then would rapidly propagate. The  same mechanism would occur in the micro-scales, such as families and other kinds of  human relations.  In summary, the human community works as one body that is in balance because there  is a continuous non-local flow of information (just like the fuel that drives a car) that  reconnects—without we are aware of it—with the original source from where we come.  When such a flow of information is broken due to "viral information", the body of human  society starts to break down and to show signs of imbalance, which always manifest in a  violent or paranoid way. The human body works exactly the same way: all the cells  contribute to the proper functioning of vital organs and this is due to a "quantum field"  (more precisely: a quantum electrodynamic coherent field, to quote research by physicists  Emilio del Giudice and Giuliano Preparata) that non-locally synchronizes all the organs,  acting on the elementary particles constituting them. When this field is interrupted, the  body gets sick and dies.  Why such viral attacks? Mostly because balanced human beings who have learned to  walk on a tightrope without falling to one side or the other are literally feared by those who  have the (totally twisted) control of a part of our universe. Inter alia, the metaphor of the  57

            tightrope means another thing too: learning to navigate among stars. This may not appeal  to "someone", but can delight in "others" (the good ones). In the long run the ability to walk  on a tightrope can become a real force, and when that force becomes powerful enough then  ideas start to form in the brain regarding completely new technologies, those that can lead  us to explore the Cosmos really far and widely.  When man ceases to fear he will find that science (because it is science, and not magic)  will not only allow us to sail in the interstellar space but also to neutralize the effects of such  viral information. We'll never be able to destroy "Mr. X" in this universe of ours (maybe he  doesn't exist in other universes), but we will be potentially able to create a shield protecting  all of us from his actions. At that time it will not be so difficult to invent and build a new  technology. In this regard, we should visualize, conceptually, a sort of impenetrable shield: a  sort of "firewall" like the one activated by our anti-virus software in our computers. At that  point no more wars will occur in the world and the biosphere/noosphere   14   will  exponentially grow in terms of non-local information content. In such a way everyone will  win the fear (even of death). It's time to take action and show the best that we can do in  science in order to break the last barrier (which is also our chains), by being completely  jaded, disillusioned and outside of any taboos, and prepared to shed light where it does not  yet exist.  The evolution of the Universe through its sentient and conscious part can be reached  only fighting against "dictatorship", because such a dictatorship produces only stasis which  in the long run can lead to degeneration and corruption. This black "creative force" is a  Virus, or a sort of parasite infecting the fair project. That's the reason why the access of  mankind (and all the other sentient beings in the Universe) to a Big Library is the only way  to grow—both individually and collectively—and to acquire consciousness of ourselves.  The possibility of uploading and downloading information through such hypothetic  Library is the only way to enrich ourselves and render us operational in an autonomous  way, with the main goal to grow towards the level of the original "constructors". This is a  marvelous project due to its perfection, and is probably the result of a hyper technology  from someone else since atavistic times of the Universe. A project that is hypothesized to  play three main roles: 1) being a sort of "software" able to make so that universal constants  are correctly fine tuned and the matter at the level of elementary particles is structured in  such a ordered way to allow us to perceive reality in its shapes; 2) creating a sort of  "hardware" in form of matter—including the mechanism of Life—from the quantum vacuum  (on the Planck scale) by modulating and inflating virtual particles in order to create  universes through the various dimensions; 3) creating a memory storage by placing it in the  quantum vacuum using the up and down states of the quantum foam as "Bits" of  information and allowing access to everyone through non-locally uploading and  downloading of such information.  I might hypothesize that the reason why these ideas never passed through our mind is  because our brain has been deliberately "imprisoned" by someone else, just like deactivating  the subroutines of software. This looks like the action of a true Virus, subtly inserted in  order to kill the original creative project in favor of another one where intelligent beings are  only the arms of a bigger mind that uses and manipulates them. This is the same as in the  society of bees. The worker bees cannot work at all if they do not receive the orders from the  queen bee.  The original healthy plan of (technological and non-transcendent) Creation inside the  Universe provides that everyone may take the role of a queen bee, in order to make the  many bricks of a big house all contributing to its formation, an house that is growing more  and more. Practically, this would be a self-replicating system whose only goal is of creating  something big that tends to the idea of "God". Or is this a technology designed in order to  make so that an asleep God is awakened becoming conscious of himself?  58

        <section id="page-59">
            If this is the case then the idea of "God" would be like potential energy in physics that  becomes kinetic energy only if a force is applied. That hyper technology (at least according  to this hypothesis) is just that force, which can be born in the Universe as a spontaneous  evolutionary process sprung from intelligence, in the same way in which a big tree with  flowers and fruits grows from a simple seed.  All the laws of physics show us that such laws are as they are due to their elegance,  harmony and simplicity. This is exactly what the book of science is showing to us. And we  know much about this, but several important issues are still to be discovered. If we search  for something new we have first to think of a criterion of elegance, i.e. something that can be  mathematically represented. For instance, the so called "anomalous phenomena", of a  transcendent nature, which occur most often in a transient way, leave our science  disoriented.  In reality, nothing is transcendent when physical interactions with our world occur, as  we can potentially measure them using our multi-wavelength scientific sensors. The data  coming from such measurements are just numbers entering inside a graph, while the  represented curve responds necessarily to a precise mathematical formula, which in turn  describes a physical law. Everything can become science if we dare to launch the ball beyond  the ditch. On the contrary, the more timorous we are, the more the mystery behind  anomalies increases and the investigation of such phenomena is considered irrational.  However, innovation in science greatly depends on following insight—the opposite of  irrationality. And the best way to do this is to try to imagine how that "hidden reality" might  be. That's the reason why making hypotheses (like the one discussed here) makes sense. To  find new theories, we need to test such hypotheses—if they are coherent and logical in their  inner construction.  59

            Chapter 12: Visions and creations  What about visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM) in different locations throughout history? Only clairvoyants could see her. Others did not. How can such a lucid vision (and words heard internally) happen to one or more persons synchronously? And why does this happen in specific locations? Clairvoyants—such as Bernadette of Lourdes, for instance—effectively both hear and see BVM in their minds (a vision that in its turn can trigger physiological effects), but none else around is able to experience the same vision. The reason is maybe because what clairvoyants see is just a "mental hologram", a sort of "induced hallucination", which is triggered by some external intelligence or that the clairvoyants attract to themselves. Obviously, their brains translate the "message" into words after decoding the encoded information where that message is contained. What possibly physically happens is that the clairvoyants non-locally receive only "information", by downloading it using their mind from the Big Library where such information is stored. As it was widely said, the quantum vacuum might be a possible "magnetic tape" where its virtual particles might be used to encode the information going directly to the spirit/consciousness of a person, in the same way in which Bits are used to encode information inside a computer. This information might be activated at any time after an external triggering pulse occurs, maybe through magnetic fields of geophysical origin interacting with human brainwave. Before speaking of visions of holy and/or demonic creatures, let's speak more on the way in which a specific environment may affect the brain and the perceptive capability of a person. There are some places in the world showing specific geophysical manifestations such as magnetic anomalies, piezoelectricity from the rocks mostly near fault lines and strange luminous phenomena. Some other places, apparently normal, are characterized in some recurrent way by "paranormal" events: this can happen near "haunted" houses or castles, or some locations inside forests. This is a constant in some places of the world, where sometimes strange events occur. These happenings are able to affect the mental or psychic state of some persons and/or to induce hallucinations in some of them. But a particular place can transform a person in the inside even without anything particular happens. What is of interests to us is why, and, above all, how this happens. Regarding this, I want to venture the hypothesis that follows. On the basis of theory regarding electrodynamic quantum coherence a sort of non-local link holds together all the cells of the human body and let them operate in unison. Let's hypothesize that such biophysical entity (such as the human body) is suddenly inserted inside a place where "particular energies" are produced. It is sufficient to think of the physics theory about how a diapason works to understand in an elementary way that here we have a resonance effect between two physical objects: in this case that specific location and the person. How might such a resonance occur? It is possible to hypothesize that the electrodynamic biofield of the person kind of tunes with the one of the place. Consequently, the non-local software of that place would be imprinted in the biofield of the person, changing her even radically even if in a transient or momentary way. This would produce an effect both in the cells of the body of that person and in her brainwave, with many consequences that might be positive or negative depending on whether phase concordance or discordance occurs, i.e. constructive or destructive interference. Some persons could be able to adapt well to such a new situation and even to feel well, others wouldn't succeed and might also go crazy. This is just a hypothesis, obviously. How would it be possible to prove or disprove scientifically such a hypothesis? In principle, it should be quite simple. As biophotons produced by the human body are a sort  60
            <div class="page-number">Page 60 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-61">
            of "response" showing the health state of the body and, most of all, an electromagnetic proof of the existence of a "project". This preexists the quantum electrodynamic mechanism controlling the body. It would be important to measure the biophotonic emission rate of a person using a photomultiplier when that person is staying in a normal place and, later, when that person is staying at those particular locations. Obviously, it would be necessary to carry out many measurements in time for the same person so as to derive a statistical standard able to describe the intensity, the frequency and the continuity in time of the emitted biophotons. The same measurements should be done to other test persons, so that one would be able to understand if all the persons are subject to the same kind of "phase transition" or if such persons show different reactions. I am expecting, in fact, statistical standards that are different, as the person parameter is not always a constant but can become a variable itself. This investigative procedure would be a long and meticulous study, but is feasible. Let's suppose that we are able to know quantitatively how much the frequency (and even the amplitude) of biophotons changes in the human body in passing from a normal to a strange/anomalous place. We could then calculate experimentally a residual value (additive or subtractive) quantified in Hertz. At that point we would be in a condition to "adjust the shot" by monitoring the anomalous place itself, using instruments operating in that frequency range and spectrometers of various kinds. As soon as we found a match between the place and the person we would be mathematically sure that a given place was able to "transform" or alter a person. Then medical analyses would follow, in order to see how and if the state of the organs (such as heart and brain) change. Psychometric analyses would be carried out too in order to see how and if the IQ of the person is subject to changes. Finally, we would use EEG analysis to verify what the standard of the brainwave at certain circumstances is after a person is exposed to a particular environment. With numerical data in hand, through which we could already infer empirically some laws, it would be then the turn of theoretical physics, which would involve both classic electromagnetism and quantum mechanics and which inevitably would lead us to search for a model able to show how a non-local field (quantum) was able to affect a local field (electromagnetic, in form of biophotons). In this light, it would be possible to hypothesize that visions of BVM don't deal with the Virgin Mary in person who appears to the clairvoyants, but rather with a non-local informative process that becomes suddenly active -—like turning on a computer. Then visions and much other information are seen, but that information is not a physical entity. It might be similar to the way a 3-D printer works. The computer sends a command to the printer to print a 3-D solid object, but such a printed object is simply something deriving from an informative process, not a true physical object per se. If we consider this hypothesis, much of what has been said previously would suggest that a vision perceived by our spirit and then vectored by our brain is not at all an "entity" but rather a pure informative process, substantially like the information contained inside a CD or a USB pen drive. That entity is not alive at all, but can be revived at any time. Such vision has probably nothing to do with the "personality" of someone, such as BVM might be. I think that extracting such information is like taking a book from a library and reading it. Visions, or vivid perceptions of holy creatures or ghosts of deceased persons—which don't physically exist as no one else sees them and no instrument is able to measure anything except for some alterations in brainwave and skin electric conductivity—appear to be holographic projections formed inside the mind of the perceiver and/or of a group of perceivers who are entangled together. This has nothing to do with physical bodies regarding the apparitions. Therefore the idea that the contact of some person (such as a medium) with the spirits of deceased persons is a connection to the Big Library and not  61
            <div class="page-number">Page 61 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-62">
            physically to those spirits, is nothing but an hypothesis. It doesn't exclude at all that someone may really meet those spirits directly: but this would be a process occurring only in the brain and not in external reality. In principle, such an information might also turn into a physical body if an "order of Life" is given (such as reincarnation, for instance), in the sense that such an information might be transplanted as a memory storage into a growing fetus and, at the same time, would serve by coordinating the correct growth of the biological cells, taking itself the role of a quantum coherent electrodynamic field. Creation might mean simply turning information into a physical being, namely a way to transform the "res cogitans" into a "res extensa", to recall the old definitions of Cartesius' philosophy. How would such a creative and materialization process work? There might be several possibilities: 1) Body creations are the result of pre-programmed designs, exactly in the same way in which an hibernated being is revived after a computer activates again his vital functions. 2) Body creations (from the information previously stored) are decided by another intelligence using a specific unthinkable non-local technology that is something between engineering, informatics and physics. 3) Body creations are mechanically activated by our own consciousness because that was a plan that was already decided during real life. It might also be that the spirit of some perceiver is able to "materialize" (or explicate) for a while the body of a deceased spirit directly from the information that he downloads from the Cosmic Big Library, so that the personality of the deceased person is suddenly revived and becomes active. Maybe this is the mechanism through which a "tulpa"   15   is formed for some time. But, more generally, this is the mechanism through which the Universe was created from the quantum vacuum (theoretical physics furnishes a confirmation of this to us). After all, the Big Library, as it is currently hypothesized, is intended to be a storage of memories, thoughts and emotions, just as a purely (non-local) informatics deposit. However, that storage might work also as an "actuator" by suddenly recreating the body of the deceased person, and nothing can be created if there is not a project behind or a recorded data of something that would then work as a stencil. We have no scientific demonstration of this yet, but may have in future. In this regard, it is interesting to mention the sci-fi movie "Solaris" from the famous Russian film director Andrej Tarkowskij, taken from a beautiful book written by Polish scientist Stanislaw Lem. It is the story of a group of astronaut-scientists working in a space station orbiting around planet Solaris. That planet is, in reality, a sort of "telepathic brain" able to extract the thoughts and recollections of those astronauts in order to materialize them in form of true living beings. It is interesting to speculate how this idea came to the mind of Lem. Let's now speak about what may happen when a tulpa is formed. Before discussing this "creative life form"—namely an individual in flesh and bones who suddenly materializes and then lives his own life—we should imagine a kind of technology of purely computer-like kind that is not based on electromagnetic signals but rather on "non-local information pulses". These would eventually locally trigger an electromagnetic signal (exactly like a quantum field in the body is able to produce biophotons). Such pulses are expected to become active on the "spirit of matter", i.e. on the "consciousness particles" composing it. These hypothetical massless particles are constantly hooked to matter being able to order or regulate it according to predetermined non-local software called "Pauli Exclusion Principle", or conversely being able to clutter it when a precise command is sent. What kind of machine can do this? The hypothesized "consciousness particles" (substantially virtual particles of the quantum vacuum) should behave in the same way as a Laser or a Bose-Einstein condensate in that they are all coherent with each other, and they  62
            <div class="page-number">Page 62 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-63">
            are all described by only one wave function. Potentially, it is possible to make many things using such particles, but only if they are governed by a precise program. I believe that the Big Library works just thanks to such particles. What we need to understand is if such particles, although being massless, are able to create mass or to dematerialize it. Some good reasons let me think that consciousness particles might be strongly related with the Higgs boson   16 , namely a particle able to confer mass to all the other matter particles according to the Standard Model. So now the question is this: how is it possible to create matter (and electromagnetic energy with it) acting directly on the "pixels" of the spacetime fabric and without using any energy input but only sending information in form of a command? This seems to be a way to do that, because if this process didn't exist then tulpas would be only a hallucination. Maybe those "pixels" are able to instruct free particles in the air (where many chemical elements would be present in suspension) and order them to join in order to form, for instance, a human or human-like body. Therefore, that body would be born substantially from a thought and an intentional act, i.e. from information vectored non-locally. In this regard, it is interesting to remind that, according to some witnesses, the creation of these entities is always preceded by the formation of a f semi-luminescent "fog". So we have to explain how an object or an entity born in the mind of someone materializes and acquires its own life. Some Tibetan monks claim they are able to create tulpas. All of this, involving the creation of (living in this case) matter from the nothing, is related with "physics of consciousness" and in particular it deals with some process in which consciousness is sometimes able to create material things on the basis of a pre-existing mental state. Here we have pure information that suddenly becomes matter. If this is possible, particles of matter must necessarily be related with some action originating from the quantum vacuum which might contain "consciousness particles" (without mass but maybe with charge) which in their turn might be related with the Higgs boson. It is absolutely necessary to invoke such a mechanism, which we didn't quantify yet in physics, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to explain how the Universe was suddenly born from the vacuum when a virtual particle inflated up to generate the Big Bang. After all the Universe is a tulpa itself! All of what involves creation from the nothing is conceptually a tulpa, namely something material (in this specific case a life form) that is created from a pre-existing "database" and surely powered by an intention. The intention might come from who experiences altered states of consciousness, such as shamans. In their turn, such altered states might be triggered by drugs or by pulsed magnetic fields or ELF waves born spontaneously as a geophysical phenomenon at some locations of Earth. But that would be the so called "rough mode". In order to do things in an orderly way, a technology is necessary—a technology able to create universes too. "Others" might have used this technology over billions years. Of course a tulpa, if it is truly a material life form and not a ghost or a hallucination, can be measured. At this point I have to assume that the so called "homunculus"   17   of some alchemy is a part of this genre of manifestations. That would be a sort of wild creation using magic, without any science. But let's imagine if all this is remotely created by a technology from an exogenous intelligence: what use would they make of this? They might be able to create simple and "ergonomic" humanoids—able to live in our atmosphere—and let them reproduce in a chain reaction. Flying vehicles too could be created here on Earth in order to allow such humanoids to move everywhere and through the planets of the Solar System. This would mirror the function of 3-D printers! Their "mind technology", being able to interact directly with the sub-quantum vacuum could be exemplified with the following scenario made of sequential phases: 1) A "project of a spacecraft" is communicated to the vacuum state. 2) The vacuum state reacts with the  63
            <div class="page-number">Page 63 of 109</div>
        </section>
        <section id="page-64">
            formation of a wave-front with infinite velocity. 3) The wave-front is instructed to stop and fix "the project" in a particular space and/or time. 4) The vacuum state produces a quantum fluctuation in form of superquantum matter (our matter) which has been instructed to appear in our world as a "spaceship" (or even a living being). 5) After an instantaneous process, the "spaceship" can be free to fly as an airship inside our atmosphere using an appropriate local propulsion, thus entering in the constraints of our spacetime. And what about the consciousness of such superior and creative beings? Their consciousness might be teleported from there to here inside beings materialized here by them, so that the creators would pilot them like robots. In fact, such beings might be simply used as "bio-drones" (substantially servants) in order to carry out several tasks. Anyway, logic would suggest us that such drones would find themselves in a hostile and fearful world, which would oblige them to hide somewhere, such as underground or undersea. Of course, all the human witnesses would arbitrarily say that such bio-drones are extraterrestrials from other planets. The point is that they would certainly be aliens, but not that kind of extraterrestrials. If this really happens or happened in the past it would consist of two things: a) An efficient way to explore other worlds using beings (and their flying machines) that are created directly here from somewhere else using non-local methods and a specific technology. b) A probable abuse of the power of creation done by beings who believe they are God. Alternatively, these beings and their "UFOs" might be a spontaneous materialization of some archetypes of the collective unconscious, according to a hypothesis elaborated by analytic psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. If so, their manifestation should be random and would occur at specific times of human history. Another possibility might be that some talented persons such as a shaman (or a Tibetan monk)—especially if their brainwave is triggered by some drug or a pulsed magnetic field of geophysical origin (as was probably happening to the mythical foreteller Sibyl in Central Italy)—experiences hallucinations which they then instinctively turn into a reality using the power of their intention by connecting unconsciously to the fabric of the creative quantum vacuum. The first ventured hypothesis (alien remote penetration), on the contrary, would predict a much more systematic manifestation, also with permanence on Earth. In all cases, it would be as if a material shape comes out from someone's mind. In fact I think that the tale "Aladdin" is inspiring in this regard, because this famous tale from the Middle-East describes exactly the process discussed. Aladdin's lantern symbolizes the quantum vacuum. I don't know what kind of vision the writer had in mind before writing this intriguing tale, but can speculate from where such a vision came. All of this obviously looks to be a kind of magic. And, to cite the most interesting hypothesis, we may doubt that alien technology of that kind could be so simply recognized as such in this time. Hence we have to be able to imagine what appears to be impossible and look deeply at what we can do with our physics knowledge. Once more, the quantum entanglement mechanism and the non-locality mechanism produced by it might be the key both for the transfer/reception of information and for the creation of animate and inanimate matter from the void. Another question that we should ask is: what would happen if a magician is also equipped with deep physics knowledge? He would undoubtedly have a super-technology at his disposal. But those who are truly curious know that nothing is really unthinkable and unfeasible. Science goes forward (often by leaps) not only by using its rigorous methodology but also by imagining scenarios that still do not exist. But if we are able to imagine so clearly such kind of coherent scenarios then there is a strong suspicion that they are real. And what is real somewhere can be potentially realized everywhere.  64

            Let's now come back to the visions of clairvoyants, without considering now the possibility of materialization in form of tulpas, intended as a creation process originating from the quantum vacuum through the intent of some intelligence (here or elsewhere). At this point of the current reasoning we cannot exclude that the visions of clairvoyants are similar to the alleged experiences of people claiming to be abducted by "aliens". I will discuss here a different hypothesis to the previous one. Many persons relate this kind of experience, which, after analyzing testimonial statistics, shows constant characteristics. If we base our analysis on mere witness cases, statistics alone would say that millions of persons have been abducted. The point here is that a witness is not a proof, but rather an emotional jumble describing something that occurred only inside the mind of the experiencer. In fact, no physical evidence has ever been found that what witnesses dramatically report truly occurred in physical reality. So called "implants" can be often explained in a prosaic way and prove nothing, especially because when such tiny things are extracted from the body and analyzed they are found to be made of biological and not technological material. Why are such experiencers so wary of receiving medical/psychological care? They intimately feel that they have lived such experience but no physical proof is evident. Therefore, I think that the hypothesis by which people see BVM previously described can also explain abduction cases. It can be that, due to some psychological or possibly environmental reasons, a person is suddenly non-locally "fine tuned" with data contained in the Big Library and that consequently mental holograms are created in their brain. Of course, the reaction of the victim to this can be a nightmare-like psychological construction of fantasy caused by the feeling of anguish and terror that such experience evokes. Some psychologists have published interesting works about this. We know nothing about so called "abductions" but much about the scenarios that human psyche is able to create under conditions of stress. Naturally, the lucid mental vision of a "gray alien" and/or a flying saucer can trigger uncomfortable sensations. Fabrications of (weak or suggestible) psyches can manufacture the rest of the story, even if these persons are reporting things in good faith. The fact remains that something happens suddenly inside their mind, and of course scientists must study this in an interdisciplinary way. As it is possible to see here, two alternative hypotheses have been proposed about the abduction phenomenon. The first dealing with a real event involving manipulation of matter structure, and the second dealing with an hallucinatory event triggered by the vision of something really existing as mere data deposited as a memory storage inside the Big Library. The first hypothesis deals with the possibility of interfering with the mechanism of matter creation, while the second deals with the possibility of receiving information non-locally from a cosmic databank. I believe that, according to circumstances, both may be true. Remaining with the second hypothesis, it is now important to study if and how a physical external factor such as a pulsing magnetic field or ELF waves can trigger all this in form of an hallucination. But, after all, what is a hallucination? Of course, it is not real in our world but might be real as information stored inside the Big Library, which is suddenly captured by the consciousness/spirit of a person—which could be materialized too, according to the weird mechanism previously mentioned. Through such "induced hallucinations" we literally enter inside an alternative reality, which is not less real than this one but that has nothing to do with it. Here, certain things do not exist at all, but there they do: therefore skeptical minds and believers are both right. The key to an explanation of all this is in the brain and the consciousness it generates and in the way in which certain "messages" and/or information are conveyed. Surely the same hypothesis can be applied to shamanic vision. A shaman might be simply a person who is  65

        <section id="page-66">
            trained to connect non-locally to the Big Library and consequently able to extract information regarding something that exists elsewhere but not here. As a third alternative, we might also imagine that sometimes both spatial and temporal dimensions might occasionally intersect, as an accidental or induced act. Perhaps abductions happen in this way. The alleged victim believes she has lived such experiences, but there is not even a shred of evidence that this has truly happened, and in fact it has never happened in our dimension, but probably in another. People (i.e., their consciousness) might live on multiple dimensions simultaneously, without knowing it. Real or unreal, materialized or not, what matters here is that a passage of information is hypothesized. This is what is most important to investigate, together with the triggering factors coming from electromagnetic fields able to create some interferential effect in the human brain in order to activate some of its functions. This factor has been repeatedly measured in a lab by neurophysiologist Michael Persinger. On the basis of his experiments the human brain can be strongly affected by magnetic fields and ELF waves so that hallucinations of several kinds are generated depending on the cultural and/or religious background of the person subject to the experiment. It remains to understand the logical and/or symbolical meaning of such lucid visions/hallucinations. Persinger has made formidable discoveries with his lab experiments by explaining very well how certain hallucinations occur, but he does not explain what hallucinations are. A person who is tested under the best lab conditions can describe in great detail such visions when that person is properly induced using Persinger-like modes, while her/his brain and other physiological parameters are accurately monitored. In a later analysis, researchers of semantics   18   might try to understand something more about those perceived hallucinatory images, by carefully distinguishing images of specific objects, landscapes or beings from symbolic images that could be used as "icons" to activate specific brain functions. Some of the images might contain encoded "messages" to be decoded by mathematicians too. The point here is that it is absolutely necessary to explain all that is recorded in an objective way so that true science can be done. And here we need only science, especially due to the huge importance of the subject. A resume is needed here. We have said that it is hypothetically possible that all that which our mind and spirit (including our emotions) experiences is constantly memorized inside a sort of "hard disk", which contains the memory of all that which has been thought and emotionally lived by all the sentient creatures in the Universe. This is hypothesized to be a sort of "supercomputer" working non-locally located inside the quantum vacuum, where the zero-one bits (of standard computers) are replaced by the states up and down of the virtual particles arising in the quantum foam that is activated inside the vacuum. On the basis of the "Big Library Hypothesis" proposed here—which expresses substantially the same concept as the so called "Akasha"of the Hindu philosophy—all the active spirits in the Universe would be simply terminals connected to a central non-local supercomputer. Mathematical theory as well as experiments such as the one carried out decades ago by physicist Hendrik Casimir effectively demonstrate that the quantum vacuum is suddenly able to exert a pressure force on a plate as if it were activated by something. This could explain how creation of matter from the nothing works. So the virtual particles produced in form of fluctuations of the quantum vacuum might work both as memory storage of information that can be downloadable and as a mechanism of creation of real matter (see Fig. 9). The process, to become active, could possibly be controlled by a highly evolved intelligence, which is not God but rather "constructors/programmers" who execute the will of God (an invisible and maybe unconscious entity) whose unimaginable technology has allowed them to engineer the quantum vacuum and use it like a computer. The goal (among  66

            other things) would be to memorize all that has been experienced by conscious spirits (both living and not living inside a physical body) of the Universe. It would therefore work as a storage databank of memories extracted from beings that once lived. All the thoughts and emotions would be constantly non-locally uploaded there as to an Internet website by every single spirit, almost none of which is conscious of what is happening. All the atoms of matter—including our body—are mostly made of pure void (the quantum vacuum), where protons, neutrons and electrons are immersed. If we hypothesize that such void is the site of consciousness then everything coming from us goes there to be memorized and then is instantly transmitted/uploaded to the Big Library. That library is not located at a specific place, but is everywhere in the Universe, just inside the quantum vacuum itself, and all the atoms of the Universe are impregnated with it. Therefore this Universe might be an incommensurable work of engineering/informatics, a creation coming from one or more highly evolved intelligences. It might also be that this mechanism is activated also when a living person (her/his spirit) and a deceased person (her/his spirit) have contacts. The main hypothesis here is that the living person is suddenly able to read the information deposited by the deceased person using her/his own consciousness and then her/his own brain/mind translates all the encoded information into an understandable (decoded) one, in the same way that, when writing computer software, we are able to turn machine language into compiler language. The living person would simply download the information that the deceased person previously uploaded to a specific "web page" that is permanently published on the non-local "cosmic Internet", through which we are probably connected even if most sentient beings are not conscious of this. You may ask: is the information sent by a deceased person who lived inside a body a message coming deliberately from the spirit of such person? The answer might be: No, that information is not a deliberate message but rather what results when our spirit, through a sort of resonance, connects with data contained in the Big Library where the memory constituted by the spirit of the deceased person is contained. Such a spirit is ready to be reactivated into a new living being at any moment through a process in which information turns into an (animate) object in the realm of matter. Again, such a possibility reminds me of the myth of Lethe, the place where, according to the ancient Greeks, a spirit rests before reincarnating. Logic tells me that such information cannot remain inactive, but must be reused in the same way in which software, created in order to be used by a computer (hardware), becomes active again, running on a new computer.  67

The (macro and micro) creation of new matter from the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum.  In some way software simply creates a reality (virtual, as it would be perceived by a receiver of the information), starting from its own new hardware. This might happen due to a command coming from the "builders" or from a pre-planned design created by such deceased spirit. At this point one might ask a new question. Is reality truly real or simply a dream or an illusion? Although we cannot answer this yet, we cannot exclude the possibility that our physical life is simply a holographic projection created by software giving the illusion of physical reality to the several consciousnesses perceiving it. If so, then spirits would live a Life in the same way in which we experience virtual reality using new technologies. Who would give the order to wear the magic glasses able to activate such a virtual reality? Possibly "God" or some other disembodied superior entities, who, being non-locally connected with our spirits, would like to feel "alive" using our spirits, namely the sparks of an infinite consciousness whose true reality wouldn't be just a physical being but rather pure information. An information made of thoughts, geometrical or symbolic shapes, and emotions. Here we would deal with a cosmic super-consciousness that lives everywhere, inside the infinite quantum vacuum, characterized by the continuous creation and destruction of virtual "particles" which, according to such specific scenario, would be the main holographic projectors of a monumental virtual reality. The point is that alleged "real" particles of the physical world cannot be seen directly, as quantum mechanics asserts that we can have an idea of their existence only by calculating a  68

            "cloud of probability". In nuclear physics, we never see them directly but only through the tracks that they leave after collisions are generated using an accelerator. No one has ever demonstrated that an elementary particle exists as a physical object, and yet we appear to be made of particles (or of superstrings, according to a recent theory that is competing with the Standard Model of elementary particles). We have a weight and a well defined shape, but we never see directly the bricks of which we are composed. So are we the main characters of a movie or a comedy, of which due to some reasons "we", through someone else, decided to be the actors? If so, then spirit and pure information would be the only existing reality, while physical life would be only a holographic projection. Maybe "God" might have wanted to do all this in order to gain consciousness of himself—simply projecting thoughts and giving to them specific shapes, which change all the time after the creation of the illusion of space and time is done. This is one possibility that we cannot exclude but that could be proved or disproved by attempting to verify, by identifying the smallest pixel of the Universe, if we were really living inside a virtual reality. Crucial experiments using interferometry are planned to test this hypothesis, in order to locate the "maximum resolution" of the Universe, checking the smallest pixel representing it by looking at what is hidden behind the energy cutoff (limit value = 10 20   Electronvolt) of high-energy particles of cosmic rays. Of course, this would be the smallest pixel, as the highest frequency, corresponding to the highest energy, represents the shortest wavelength, which in its turn has the dimensions of a space. Let's now go back to the original Big Library Hypothesis. Apart from the possibility that the information characterizing a spirit per se may remain unused for a certain time, being stored inside the Big Library, I believe that, if this Universe is not the holographic projection of an illusion, consciousness must exist only in order to explicate itself. This can happen only if such a consciousness is living inside a physical body of some kind that is able to allow specific conditions—in particular the extrication of consciousness through a quantum coherent physical medium such as a neural correlate of some kind (of which the brain is just a possibility among others). On the contrary, consciousness would be just software that is not used at all for Life, and this would be senseless. Software can be used only if hardware (namely a computer) exists to run it. Conversely, it would make no sense, unless such hardware is an illusion. All of this is said in addition to the possibility that the information about a dormant spirit (belonging to a deceased body) may be extracted from the spirit of a living being using a "downloading mode" directly from the Big Library. Some talented persons such as mediums or "channellers" speak about "evolved beings" or "ascended masters" (probably a step below the builders/creators). Interesting if such claims are not the usual fakes. Would such masters attempt to improve the non-local software present in the Big Library created by the builders? Would they prompt someone— through their subconscious—to convey some spiritual concepts to ordinary people in order to wake their consciousness? This might be happening because mankind in general feels the sudden need to discover its true nature, and that true nature might just reside inside the human spirit—namely the main true storage of all that which was thought and felt by emotions. In this light, the body might be just a vector to increase our own awareness. It is natural to believe that the only way to ascertain all of this is to build up a rigorous and illuminated physical science able to investigate certain fundamental issues of the human existence, i.e. something that can be shared by the entire humanity in an inter- subjective way. What kind of science should this then be? It should be physics, of course. A rational and mathematical physics respecting the scientific method. What is the difference between standard physics and such a new physics?  69

            The main difference is that while "normal" physics often seems to work as a photo camera equipped with a fixed focus lens (namely, a rigid thing), the "new physics" would be expected to work as a photo camera equipped with a zoom lens able to switch from short to long focal lengths in order to be much more flexible when passing from analysis to synthesis and vice versa. If I use a fixed focus lens with long focal length I can, for instance, take a photograph of an enlarged house. The house is portrayed in the photo and none can doubt it. But If I use a fixed focus lens with short focal length (wide angle) I see a much smaller house surrounded by other things, and this is true as well. The "spirit issue" demands that we never lose an overall vision of things, just like the flight of a bird. This is simply because the spirit is itself a flight, where everything is linked.  70

            Chapter 13: BLH and astrobiological non-locality  We discussed extensively the Big Library Hypothesis (BLH), where "spirits" are able to  communicate non-locally by uploading and downloading information. A more concrete  variant of this theory exists, born from quantum biophysicist Fred Thaheld. This is  interesting because it is possible to carry out scientific measurements in order to prove or  disprove it. The reason of this is that possible "messages" and/or information, although  being non-local, are expected to be deposited directly in our brain, whose sinusoidal  electrical activity can be measured using an EEG instrument.  Big Bang cosmology assumes that 14 billion years ago all that which existed was in a  state of entanglement in a single Unity. It is hypothesized that this level of entanglement  has been maintained and therefore that all the physical inanimate and animate objects in  the Universe, which in their turn are composed of elementary particles, contain inside a  track of such non-local link.  According to this, before matter as we know it and spacetime containing it were born,  particles potentially existing before the Big Bang were all interacting together in a state of  singularity. The idea is that particles formed after the Big Bang, although being transformed  into further particles of more advanced generation from time to time, have maintained this  primal bond. Such an unbreakable connection should regard some particle parameters,  such as the spin, for instance. In this specific context, we might consider some quantum  parameters describing quarks too, such as electric and color charge. Some scientists even  hypothesize that topological points of space (hypothetical "topons"   19 ) may be in a state of  quantum entanglement together, so that matter would not be involved at all here but rather  only space. After all, following some items discussed in this book this wouldn't be so  different than thinking that space (or spacetime) has the same properties as "quantum  consciousness".  Such a hypothesized entanglement link would involve both living and non-living matter.  The neurons of our brain are composed of many particles, such as electrons, protons and  neutrons that are aggregated first in molecules and then in cells. One more reason for which  this kind of non-local communication may be possible is undoubtedly due also to the  particular nature of the brain and consciousness that it generates. If Penrose's and  Hameroff's theory on "quantum brain" is correct, the brain itself thanks to the microtubules  contained in it is a quantum entity. Obviously, at this point, two or more quantum objects—  i.e. composed of a large number of micro-components in a state of quantum coherence—  should be able to interact with each other, whatever the distance is separating them. In this  way such a system of non-locally connected brains would make a single widened brain  constituting a unique entity described by only one wave function.  I would be tempted to suggest that this might be the mostly used communication  technique between advanced civilizations both in our Universe and in the Multiverse. I will  then explain the reasons of this.  Therefore, according to this hypothesis, the neurons of our brain might be entangled  with the neurons of the brains of any other creature existing in the Universe. If this is the  case, an extremely advanced civilization from elsewhere might be capable to "instruct" the  neurons of other intelligences scattered in the universe using information of whatever kind,  which would be deliberately non-locally transmitted in the same way in which a lighthouse  is constantly beaming ships on the high seas. This information would be deposited into the  neurons of living intelligent beings in any other part of the universe, and it could be  recognized and decoded if such beings are equipped with the appropriate analysis  technique.  It might also be that in reality any living and sufficiently evolved being—but not  necessarily intelligent or technological—has the capability to transmit spontaneously and  71

            unconsciously information by using such non-local mechanism. But this would be totally  chaotic information which—as Thaheld states—would constitute that which would be called  "background noise", conceptually similar to the cosmic background radiation (fossil  radiation left by the Big Bang), which could be quite easily distinguished from non-local  information sent deliberately and appropriately coded.  Therefore, according to this hypothesis, the quantum entanglement mechanism might  be much more diffused than anyone imagined before and it might involve also objects much  bigger than an elementary particle. Thaheld is not the only scientist thinking in this way,  and presently the number of physicists hypothesizing that the entanglement mechanism is  operational on mesoscopic scales such as neurons, is increasing more and more.  This is even more possible if we consider that entanglement links between particles  inside our material universe could be mediated by virtual particles of the quantum vacuum,  in the sense that virtual particles would be entangled with material particles, which in their  turn would become entangled together (see Fig. 7). In few words it might be that at levels  that are presently hidden to us a non-local link may exist indeed among all the matter  particles of the universe, and therefore among the more or less macroscopic objects which  elementary particles compose being their fundamental bricks. What is of most interest to us  here is the fact that such links might involve living and sentient beings too.  In this light, assuming that also the "neural cells" of biological creatures in the universe  are in a state of quantum entanglement, we might suggest that advanced alien civilizations  might be potentially capable of transmitting non-local messages directly into our brains. All  this has nothing to do with telepathy, but rather with signals that supposedly would be  directly deposited in the neurons of our brain. In principle the receiver shouldn't be aware  of this. By monitoring our sinusoidal brainwave (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta waves) using  high-resolution EEG in the domains of frequency, amplitude and time and using specific  algorithms we would be in a condition to search for intelligently structured signals trying to  extract them from the "noise" of normal brain waves (see Fig. 10).  The analytical phase should be extremely accurate also because the working hypothesis  that most brains may be connected to each other provides not only intelligent and deliberate  messages but also random and unintentional ones coming from anywhere and constituting  a source of "background noise" to be eliminated in a subsequent phase. The EEG technique  to be used must be necessarily characterized by high resolution in frequency, amplitude and  time, in such a way that any possible signal buried inside the "noise" of brainwave is not  erased by the procedures of math average done by software to draw such brainwave.   The  signals that we want to measure are expected to be highly structured, written in  mathematical language, and manifesting continuously.  Of course, it is expected that a sophisticated civilization might be able to send these  messages in such a way that the signal would largely exceed the background noise.  Algorithms such as FFT (Fourier Fast Transform) or KLT (Karhunen-Loeve Transform)  could quite easily be able to extract the signal from the noise after sinusoidal EEG track is  normalized to 1 using polynomial interpolation (rectification/normalization   20   procedure).  Such kind of experimental test has been proposed by this author in recent years. In fact this  hypothesis can be experimentally proved or disproved. The potentially obtainable result  would be of twofold importance because: A) It might prove that alien intelligence owns a  technology able to communicate non-locally everywhere in the universe, through the  transmission of structured information deposited in neurons; b) It might prove that the  mechanism of quantum entanglement is effectively operational everywhere in the  universe—dealing not only with elementary particles but with more complex aggregates too  and that a supposedly quantum entity per se such as our own brain might work also as a  non-local transmitter and receiver, in addition to being a vector of consciousness.  72

            Figure 10.   Above . Typical electroencephalographic (EEG) chart of a tested person.   Below . Normalization of the brainwave to a straight line in search for intelligent signals inside the noise.  In few words, Thaheld's hypothesis on astrobiological non-locality—otherwise called  NLSETI (Non-Local Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)—speaks about a sort of "non-  local emails" (with "attachments" in case). After all, this is expected to be a sort of non-local  "informatics system". Analogously with such intentional transmission of information to the  brain I believe that something similar to a "non-local Internet" may be hypothesized too,  and this constitutes the basis of the BLH hypothesis that I have amply discussed so far here.  According to this all the brains of living beings in the Universe might be able to upload  information to a sort of "non-local library", hypothesized to be the project of a superior alien  civilization. Such uploading operation might be done both intentionally in forms of vectored  signals or unintentionally in form of background noise.  Of course the same mechanism would be also working when information is downloaded  from the "non-local Internet". In such a way possible signals received non-locally from our  brain might be the result of both sending/uploading of intentional information (non-local  email and/or non-local Internet) from some intelligence and downloading of information  from us. More logically, we should expect that at first the first mode (non-local email) is  operational in order to alert the targeted brain about the existence of a database of  information, which initially would be sent using an "attachment" or with the indication of a  "link" to connect with. In the subsequent phases the brain (and consciousness with it)  would connect spontaneously to the memorized links as soon as there is an unconscious  need to do that. But the perception of images, visions, sounds or smells (just to cite only  some of the possible "data") would be totally lucid and conscious.  All this said common sense would lead us to think that probably the best procedure to  communicate with other beings in the Universe would be to use the NLSETI Protocol just  discussed here. The same applies, even more justifiably, also if a communication between  different dimensional realms is going on. In fact the process of quantum non-locality has  the main prerogative of being able to avoid any constraint of space and time, and therefore  any possible alternative dimension of space and possibly time—if, indeed, the arrows of  time are more than one and not only one. This would be suitable for communication, even if  it were not the transmission of neural cells but rather different kinds of brain-hardware  (biological or not) belonging to entities structured differently than yet but having exactly the  same capability of receiving and transmitting non-locally information.  From what has been said so far it is possible to hypothesize that the mechanism of  exchange of non-local information between a sentient being and the Big Library database  might involve not only consciousness alone but the neural correlate of consciousness too,  namely the brain. If this is the case (and this might be the case indeed) all the information  received (i.e. downloaded) by the consciousness of an individual in form of images, icons,  words, sounds, smells and other information might also leave a "remnant" in the brainwave,  in order that it can be rationally and quantitatively analyzed. If so then it would be  interesting to verify if and how the perceived information "via consciousness" is time-  correlated with possible signals that are extracted directly from the brainwave. It might also  73

            be that during the conscious perception of information (through hypnagogic state, for  instance) the Theta state of brainwave is enhanced: in fact it might that part of brainwave  that should be considered first in order to search for physical signals inside the noise forest.  By considering—and in case testing—both the BLH hypothesis and the more concrete  NLSETI one, we might be in a condition to understand how genial inventions and/or art  works have been done during the history of human civilization, and how really the process  of "intuition" works when our consciousness is activated. All this might come from our  unconscious capability to connect non-locally with a super-database available to all  intelligent beings in the universe. We could be able to extract entire sequences of data  and/or "icons" the goal of which is of activating cerebral processes. It comes to my mind the  experience of chemist August Kekulè when he suddenly discovered the chain of Benzene  after dreaming a coiled snake. Conceptually such visions seem to play a similar role as the  one of the black monolith shown in the famous Stanley Kubrick's movie "2001 A Space  Odyssey". That role is to stimulate our intelligence. This surely happens but we still have to  understand in detail how the mechanism works in pretty physical terms, so that one day we  might be able to handle it all the times we need it.  When all this becomes science we will be able to share and diffuse it. At that point of the  evolution of our knowledge not only the few existing "Teslas" would enjoy this mechanism  of acquiring information but many other Teslas could be born too. The role of scientists is to  share this in a scientifically treatable way after understanding it well and in detail. Here we  do not want to get and/or diffuse "revelations". We simply want to understand how the  mechanism works so that we can control the entire process without risk of mental  manipulation.  The experience of inventor Nikola Tesla is spectacular and must be mentioned. He  claimed that all his inventions were "ready in his mind", with no need of elaborated  preliminary calculations, tests or simulations, so that he could immediately pass to the  practical realization of his ideas. The Tesla topic might be an illuminating example of how it  is possible to use a certain kind of information if we are able to be aware of it, independently  from the possibility that a measurable track may be deposited in the neurons or not. In fact  here we are reconsidering—in a parallel way with the scientific pragmatism of NLSETI—the  BLH hypothesis as a knowledge resource per se.  The academicians of yesterday and of today, facing a peculiar case, such as Tesla's mind,  remain astonished. How is it possible that an inventor is able to pass directly to the  technical-practical part of an experiment so accurately without doing any feasibility  calculation previously, using only simple sketches on his block notes? The methodology of  standard science and engineering always starts by making detailed calculations and  theoretical models constituting the theoretical simulation of a planned experiment. Such a  canonic procedure, in addition to allowing everyone to control the proper functioning,  allows all the other researchers to make a confrontation together through technical  publications in order to optimize the result of a discovery or a technological invention.  And yet there is no doubt that some persons—often defined geniuses—are evidently able  to "see". They are the "visionary guys", so scornfully called by those who are totally blind  and therefore not truly able to add a new chapter to human evolution through knowledge  and understanding. The point is that true visionaries are not limited to "see", but rather  they understand what they see. The capability of having visions coupled with rational and  creative intelligence makes the difference. Together with Tesla, Leonardo da Vinci was one  of such visionaries who were able to realize what they "saw", followed by Galileo, Newton,  Einstein and some others.  Regarding all of this I have the strong sensation that during human history—for  instance during Renaissance or other periods including the long and dark middle age—  something big may have happened (periodically) in the world. Someone from out there  74

            might have shot a "cluster of bullets", some of which reached the target, of which only 1-5%  people understood the meaning of the message. The others (95-99%) understood nothing of  what they saw in their mind and just due to that maybe some of them started to practice  witchcraft or similar activities, namely what they thought they understood of the conveyed  mental message. This is as if a person walking inside a forest finds a bottle with a message  inside but misunderstands the logic of what is written inside. And the rough and violent  reaction by the Church completed the work.  If true geniuses like Tesla were able to connect to the Big Cosmic Library, potentially  anyone else could do the same. But it is equally obvious that this hypothetic capability to  "connect", when it is not associated to a punctual rational elaboration of the acquired  information, might result to be a totally sterile or altered operation. If such information is  acquired by the right hemisphere of the brain and/or "visualized" by the pineal gland, then  such information, in order to become operational, must be immediately transferred to the  left hemisphere, which in its turn would decode and interpret the received information  using a rational mode. Otherwise, it would be like filling a gasoline can without putting it  inside the tank of a car. The human brain is structured in such a way that it has two main  separate functions that, for reasons not yet clear to us, seem not to want to communicate  with each other. But who manages to make them communicate together, as well as who is  skilled in vividly displaying that information, can only be defined with one name: that of a  genius.  In this regard let's recall Tesla's view about the physical nature of reality and some  anomalies he recorded during of his experiments. Tesla didn't only realize his many  technological inventions but elaborated qualitative hypotheses about fundamental physics,  too. For instance, he claimed that energy is not contained inside matter but rather in the  space among the particles inside the atoms, and that the speed of propagation of a signal  can be greater that the speed of light.  In this regard, it is interesting to remember something that he punctually reported in  his diary. During his experiments with his "amplification transmitter" in Colorado Springs  he often noticed that, in addition to the normal electromagnetic field, energy of different  nature was manifesting in a parallel way. This was not the delirium of a madman but  resulted from the empirical observation of some anomalous phenomena that occurred  during his experiments. He had noticed that the flow of electric current in conductors was  not the true cause of strange and unexpected phenomena that in the course of some of his  experiments were manifested as "flares of blue light" of transient character, which then  ceased as soon as the current started to flow in the lines. At that time, no one seemed  interested to find out why and how dramatic increases of electric static potential were  occurring. Tesla, focusing on the observed anomaly, saw in it a powerful and unknown form  of energy that needed to be understood scientifically and possibly harnessed.  That energy is today called "scalar field". So far no official demonstration of the  existence (and their rigorous explanation) of scalar waves has been found. But some  theories—in particular the ones elaborated by researcher Thomas Bearden—have been  proposed according to which such waves, compared to normal electromagnetic vector  waves, are characterized by an oscillation of time and propagate through many dimensions.  Scalar waves are hypothesized to be born from the quantum vacuum—a void that is  massless but with electric charge and flooded with charged virtual particles. This  manifestation is supposed not to exist in ordinary space but only in spacetime in its totality.  There is no doubt that this theory has much in common with the concept of "consciousness  particles" discussed in previous sections of this book.  Being able to harness the scalar field means to have in hand the mechanism of Creation,  and the capability to fully manipulate the quantum vacuum, both at the level of mind and at  the level of matter. Most of all, Tesla was convinced that all the properties of matter and  75

        <section id="page-76">
            energy derive from a hypothetical "ether", which would permeate the entire Universe. At  our times such ether is called using several denominations that anyway describe exactly the  same concept: Planck field, zero point energy, or more simply, quantum vacuum. As it is  possible to notice, also in this aspect of Tesla's experience, this fundamental concept about  quantum vacuum is again called into question, which at this point should be seen—once  more—from two perspectives. On one side, quantum vacuum is considered as the overall  information storage and, on the other, as the source where matter and energy are created.  The astonishing fact here is that Tesla, when he was arguing about the concept of ether, was  simply describing (even if at that time only in qualitative terms) the source from where the  ideas of his inventions were coming! And Tesla's speculations match quite well with mine  when I invoke the BLH hypothesis.  Perhaps, thanks to the BLH hypothesis, genius could be a mental feature that is  widespread among civilizations far more evolved than ours elsewhere in the cosmos.  Perhaps this has stimulated some of them to invent even a technology that allows them to  move smoothly from one point to another of the universe in order to explore it. Returning to  the example of Tesla, we have to remind ourselves that the limited capability of abstraction  and discernment of too many people could associate this hypothesis directly to the fanciful  and New-Age assertion that Tesla "was in direct contact with extraterrestrials" (coming here  to visit him, of course).  Regardless of these improper associations, the fact is that there are scientific projects  ready to test the BLH hypothesis using the NLSETI protocol. This would surely help  scientists to understand how individuals like Tesla, Einstein and other geniuses can be born  and how they can continuously exert their skills and talents. In fact, what insights the  highest interest for Tesla in scholars are not only his many striking inventions but also the  nature of his mind. So an inevitable question comes. As soon as we understand the nature of  such hypothesized mechanism of acquisition of non-local information is it possible to  multiply one genius to a million? Science—certainly not simple shamanic visions—will  furnish the answer.  Such method of communication is evidently intended to convey information that might  be both positive and/or negative, but in any case, it would be true information. Regarding  this, I am more than sure that if someone connected with the Big Library wanted to do a  search on Jack the Ripper he could do that going to see the track that he left. The knowledge  of everything (including the most negative facts) is necessary in order to learn and to evolve.  But, as I anticipated previously, I believe that only a few are able to evolve. I see the  mechanism of human creation as shrapnel of rifle bullets shot by some geniuses. Only some  of these bullets are able to hit the target. All others miss and are dispersed. Or it would be  like the production of those million spermatozoa that are released during sex. Only a few,  maybe two or three, are able to fertilize the egg. All the others are mere parts of the divine  orchestra, more extras than actors.  In any fact "not all that which glitters is gold", in the sense that someone might have  been able to send non-locally viral information that is not true. In the same way in which  when we navigate through the Internet it may happen that the server we have reached is not  the correct one but rather another one that has hijacked our connection. We cannot  therefore exclude the possibility that some forger (another intelligence, which is not the one  who created the Big Library) enjoys manipulating our mind (and consequently our actions)  by inserting inside our brain spurious information.  Of course, this is an excellent way to divert us from the correct road to truth. The day in  which we gain a full understanding of the way in which this kind of communication works,  we will not only learn things about the Universe (and also about the other intelligences) that  before we didn't even dream of, but also will have a powerful "tunable shield" too, which will  permit us to filter the good from the bad., Once such knowledge is established, we'll have at  76

            our disposal two important capabilities: 1) a sort of "anti-missile shield" able to protect us  from any intruders; 2) the ultimate "mental telescope" in order to expand our knowledge on  the true nature of the Universe and of Life. One day we'll cancel totally all of our fears, as  we'll have a much better knowledge on "how the machine works". Probably someone from  elsewhere is trying to warn us about some threats deliberately, but most people are not yet  able to hear even if that someone is practically "shouting". But a few hear, even if rarely,  during the pre-sleep state or during lucid dreams.  We should start to imagine the strategy of this intelligence (the positive one) when it  wants to communicate deliberately with us. Reverting to the analogy afforded by old  computers, they might communicate with us using the "machine language", i.e. encoding  information into compact packages in form of images, sounds, smells, tastes etc. It is up to  us to try to understand how to decode or unzip such a package in order to turn that message  into rational schemes or to understand which brain functions are activated and how.  This intelligence from beyond might also wish to warn us on the threat that I mentioned  before. In fact, we should start to think of the possibility that those who deceive mankind do  that in order that we may never understand the true reality of the Universe. Knowledge is  power and control even in our society, and this should be a general cosmic rule. Possibly,  the good ones have sent a sort of "message in a bottle" and we have to find it, open the  bottle and understand what is written inside.  No doubt, the bad ones, in return, go on sending lies and "opium" to populations in  order to manipulate them and their belief system, including wonders in the sky that in  reality are only illusion. Power can be exerted only over ignorance: this is a universal rule.  But we, intelligent and curious people are interested in searching and absorbing the true  information conveyed by the good ones, i.e. the true Builders. In reality, just because we are  intelligent and do not need new "gods" in order to feel protected and drop our  responsibilities, we do not care so much about them but about the information that their  non-local engineering is able to convey.  If all this is really happening, then the intelligent part of the Universe would not be  limited by the finite light speed to transmit information—a fact that would keep the  Universe separate from itself in huge distances—but rely on a cosmic web where everyone  can transmit and receive data using a solely non-local mode. Apart from the theoretical  possibility of physically traveling great distances in the Universe by manipulating the  structure of spacetime (through wormholes   21   and/or warpdrive   22 ), which some alien  civilization might have already realized, the Universe might be a place where information  can be exchanged in real time between its intelligent and conscious creatures.  This might be the real and only true prerequisite to enter inside a "Galactic Club" or  even extragalactic or interdimensional ones, provided that a form of technology able to  amplify and control the process exists. In fact it is obvious that if such a process of acquiring  non-local information is limited to the perception by the individual, subjective (or intimate)  sphere, no information can be validated scientifically, mostly because the start time of non-  local connection might be unpredictable. There must be a technique that is repeatable at  will able to initiate the connection and a way to record data, one of which might be  characterized by the measurement methods expected to be used through the NLSETI  protocol.  In this last part of this chapter, speaking about the NLSETI detection methods, we have  mostly discussed "messages" or intentional transmission of signals, albeit by a non-local  mode. But, as it was widely hypothesized before, are we really sure that such process of  information communication must necessarily be conducted only by receiving intentional  messages (just like receiving e-mails using our computers)? Or should we suppose that it is  our own mind (or even our psyche) that logging in a non-local mode with some  77

            "information library" is able to download in often unconscious way information exactly as  when downloading documents from an Internet website?  In fact, here we have to reconsider once more the spontaneous mode described in the  BLH hypothesis. One would assume that some advanced civilization—and it would be  difficult to determine exactly what type might be—may have put up a kind of "non-local  database" from where everyone could potentially download information of any kind. At this  point, if the parallel with the Internet is really accurate, one might even think that this  hypothetical mental connection can allow both downloading and uploading of information,  which might occur both sequentially and simultaneously according to the cases.  Wanting to further fantasize (and imagination often pushes science forward), one might  also think that some razor-sharp "images" that some people suddenly perceive during the  pre or post-sleep condition, such as hypnagogic and/or hypnopompic images, may actually  have the function of being real "zipped files" recognized at the level of consciousness (which  is a form of awareness, not just a dream). This would produce effects in the physical  counterpart of consciousness, i.e. in the brain, which is exactly the neural correlate of  consciousness, or the means by which consciousness manifests. This simply means that the  strange clear visions suddenly perceived by our mind might not be only a personal  impression at the level of consciousness but also a manifestation producing something  measurable in the brainwave: this is where the BLH Hypothesis meets with the NLSETI  protocol.  What interests us from a scientific point of view deals with what happens inside  neurons, which is effectively measurable. In such a way the BLH hypothesis would be also  indirectly testable. Of course the best way to address this research is to carry out EEG  measurements (mostly) on selected persons both while they are awake and when they are  asleep, namely those who experience hypnagogic/hypnopompic visions or altered states of  consciousness, psychic talents (such as remote viewers, for instance), and even shamans.  With no doubt shamans might be able to gain access to this kind of information even if only  instinctively, although they might be trained to this kind of connection. If no signal in their  brain is present we might think that shamanism is only mere hallucination induced by  drugs and caused by no real external trigger. There are ways to prove or disprove that using  scientific methods.  What made me always upset is the issue of certain "visions" occurred to me quite often  until a decade ago (now more rarely). My strong and most intimate impression was that  they were real information—maybe not sent intentionally by anyone, but depending on my  mood at that specific time which possibly sparked a synchronicity with the source producing  these visions.  For a moment, I was able to "see" these amazing images, which were always preceded  by the vision of a "star-like light". As soon as this light was starting to move through a kind  of "mental black screen" images kept coming one after the other (faces, landscapes, cities,  animals, plants, space, spacecrafts) in well defined colors and high definition for a period of  time that was not more than a minute, but usually only a few seconds.  I found this kind of vision far better than being at the cinema. It was something  extremely accurate and realistic and not due to dreams. My first guess was that this process  works according to the principle of physical resonance or oscillation (mechanical or  electrical, it does not matter which: it is the same physical mechanism): the moment in  which the "frequency" is correctly tuned then our mind goes immediately resonated with a  kind of "non-local transmitter". A thousand and more reasons make me suspect that this is  the result of a sort of information technology created by other intelligences in the universe,  who can get in touch deliberately with us and/or induce us to connect with some  informative databank. But my true goal is to see how our science can investigate this. It is  78

            also from these experiences that my idea of NLSETI was born, which in its turn was greatly  empowered by Dr. Thaheld's hypothesis, which I read years later.  It would also be interesting to try to understand scientifically if a certain environment—  I am referring to its precise geological and geophysical characteristics—can enhance certain  "visions", increasing some unusual ability of the human brain. I would suggest that the  magnetic characteristics (in the strictly physical sense of the term) of a place, and especially  certain magnetic anomalies because of particular minerals or ionic currents caused by  movement of water underground, may affect the human brain. Similar experiences have  been reported in Sedona, Arizona (USA), and Cerro Uritorco, Argentina and in several other  places of the world. Lab experiments by neurophysiologist Michael Persinger with test  patients are the first thing that comes to my mind. In fact, it has been repeatedly  demonstrated that pulsed magnetic fields and/or ELF waves are able to cause  "hallucinations" and/or lucid visions in many tested persons.  So then one might ask what exactly a hallucination is? In general, a true hallucination is  caused by a totally wrong perception of reality, especially if this is inducted by drugs. But I  might also suspect that hallucination is a state in which the brain becomes particularly  receptive to other realities, and that someone (out there or maybe here too) has created a  refined "mind technology" to convey information.  I am tempted to suggest that hypnagogic/hypnopompic vision, external magnetic fields  (natural or not), some hallucinations characterized by vivid images and a specific  technology of information transfer are strictly correlated factors. This must be studied  scientifically in-depth: we have at our disposal all the means to examine these factors  together.  It is clear that only a part of the received information (with or without a signal in the  brain) might be considered true or positively-driven. In fact none can exclude that some  malevolent intelligence, which of course is expected to be aware of this technology, might  deliberately transmit false information and/or the plans to make dangerous realizations  such as weapons of mass destruction, for instance, or even send specific "icons" able to  prompt that part of the brain capable of inducing a person to commit crimes or suicide.  After all, if a negative intelligence is able to handle such technology, it might use it to create  chaos or wars. Disruptive events involving persons who, with no apparent reason, commit  murders or even massacres might be incited by using this mode. We cannot demonstrate yet  that all this really happens, but there are reasons to believe that the investigations on this  hypothesis might have a twofold valence: making a quantum leap in our knowledge of  reality and of extraterrestrial intelligence, and helping us to build a possible (technological)  shield against the dangerous side of such mental technology.  In general, certainly I think that using brain-driven information obtained from NLSETI  techniques we might largely accelerate our learning process and also empower our rational  brain.  So far I have discussed about information received/transmitted non-locally. Because of  its hypothesized nature this procedure could truly allow communication in real-time, just  leaving enough time to prepare a response. Precisely, how could we work out a response,  once we have established that a part of the received signals is of intentional nature?  Without any need to use the brain of a living being, we could use a container of neural  cells and stimulate it with a Laser beam or magnetic pulses modulated intelligently in order  to send well coded response signals, and assuming that neural cells have been previously  linked through appropriate substances (such as an anesthetic) with the test subject from  which intelligent EEG signals have been previously detected. Indeed experiments with  neural cells were done by a research group at the University of Milan almost two decades  ago.  79

        <section id="page-80">
            The experiments were carried out on separate containers of neural cells demonstrating  entanglement events. Neurons were grown in a container. Later a sample of neural cells was  taken from the container, which was then grown in another container. The hypothesis was  that the neurons present in both containers were connected by an entangled state.   There  remained then to find out a way to manifest this state. Laser was used—knowing well that  neurons are sensitive to certain electrical stimuli—directing its beam to the second  container of neural cells separated from the first. Researchers then observed a striking  electrical reaction in the neurons present in both containers, thus demonstrating that the  entanglement phenomenon seems to occur at the level of neural cells too, and not only in  elementary particles.  Later, experiments on the so-called "macroscopic quantum entanglement", led by  Chinese biophysicist Huping Hu, seemed to show that after putting the brain in contact with  a substance such as an anesthetic and then after stimulating this substance—well separated  at a great distance from test subject—with a magnetic field or, alternatively, using a Laser  beam, the brain seemed to react immediately as if it had instantly absorbed that substance.  On the basis of these experiments, as it is already possible to guess, in the case of a  future NLSETI experiment we might truly be able to respond to any message received in a  non-local way, following a similar procedure. Substantially, it would be a kind of Morse  code transmitted using an eventually nanopulsed Laser beam or a magnetic field, both  subservient to a computer program where the code has already been written. The first  response messages would be simple; the following ones would be much more elaborate. Of  course both the encoding operations (previously done by us) and the decoding ones (of  signals coming from other intelligences) would demand a sophisticated work by  mathematicians, logicians and even experts in ancient languages.  An action of this kind—namely sending a response in real time—is instead completely  barred in the case of any signals of electromagnetic nature received using the procedural  protocol of the standard SETI Project, using which if we are lucky we could certainly detect  intelligent signals but then we'd be totally unable to respond in real time due to the obvious  limitations of light speed at which an electromagnetic signal propagates.  Therefore, according to this procedure we could only receive electromagnetic  information from alien civilization that is perhaps already extinct, but we could never  initiate a dialogue due to the enormous involved distance and the finite speed of light.  Obviously the standard SETI Project might send a response signal (radio or Laser, it does  not matter which), but this signal would reach the recipient only after a time as long as the  light years separating the transmitter from the receiver.  Due to these reasons there is no doubt that the NLSETI protocol, if its scientific validity  will be demonstrated, may represent a huge potential for the future. And probably this  would be the only true way allowing humanity to join consciously to a real "Galactic Club",  where every communication is possible in real time and following a two-way direction.  It could also be that neurons are not the only potential non-local carriers/receivers of  information, since DNA too could be considered as a suitable means to receive non-local  information of extraterrestrial origin, especially considering the properties of the so-called  "junk" part, which is presently the subject of intense studies in biophysics such as those  carried out by Dr. Peter Gariaev in Russia.   The DNA in its entirety could be a treasure chest.  In particular, we could better study the "junk DNA" and try to understand what function it  does, including electromagnetic aspects bound to DNA (Biofield).  According to recent credited theories a true copy of the information acquired by our  consciousness (both individual and collective) may be located inside two precise biological  sites: the DNA and brain microtubules. What should we examine then in order to find out  80

            solid scientific proofs of this hypothesis? We should analyze, respectively, biophotons (from  DNA) using photomultipliers and the "noise" of the brainwave as deduced from EEG.  We already spoke a lot about what we would measure from brainwave. Now, what could  we measure from biophotons? The answer can be given by new answers. How does their  intensity and frequency change? How does the duration of a pulse change? How does it  increase and decade? What is the change of their level of quantum coherence? How are  molecular radio waves correlated with biophotons and when does this happen? I am pretty  convinced that biophotons might convey a message similar to the Morse code of NLSETI  and that we should decode it. Once the message is decoded then surely we would have the  key elements to be able to build on a theoretical model that makes sense and is perfectly  comparable to the observed reality.  We cannot study the "non-local field" (and consciousness with it) if we do not study first  the products of its creation. Only then we would be in a condition to understand how the  quantum field and consciousness are interfaced to matter and energy, which represent the  world of causality in which we live. Science works on matter and energy: besides this there  can be no science. It is just on the body (even the universe itself) that we have to investigate.  I'm not a materialistic inveterate. If anything, I think (very strongly) that consciousness and  body are closely linked everywhere. Mind/consciousness cannot be measured directly as it  is an abstract entity (definitely, it is timeless), but we are able to measure indeed what  consciousness produces.  We cannot make the mistake of focusing only on the non-local aspect, because it is the  local aspect that can allow us to understand "if a butterfly passed above a flower ". After all  Nature is funny: it contains in itself, at an allegoric and metaphoric level, exactly what we  are searching for. The bees pollinate the flowers: in the same way consciousness pollinates  the body. How then to study the bees if we do not see them anymore on the flower? Simply  by studying their relics on the flower.  I am convinced that the wondrous engineers who built the universe and us must have  left a mark of their passage into the DNA and the brain: the nice news here is that we can  measure both of them precisely.   The road to progress is based—with no doubt—on the  methodological rigor in scientific procedures of measurement and theorization, but also on  the courage to dare and explore entirely new terrains. Proving or disproving a certain  hypothesis is just what matters.  Apart from the enormous difficulties to face in our own Universe (such as the way to  produce negative energy to open a Stargate, which anyway is not an impossible thing  theoretically) I exclude quite strongly that civilizations living in other universes (within a  bigger Multiverse) are able to teleport themselves directly and physically into our Universe  (i.e.: literally bringing their body and their means here), because there could be an  incompatibility between their laws of physics and ours. But I think that, most likely, they  might be able to send and receive non-local messages using the NLSETI method.  In this regard, I think that using the NLSETI technique we may find many more  civilizations than we could find using the standard SETI one, even if only a part of them  might be located in our Universe. Many, probably the vast majority of all possible NLSETI  signals, may be non-intentional (if we accept that there is a form of entanglement among all  the particles of the Multiverse, which however we still have to find out), but I doubt that we  can discover them, as they probably would manifest as a hardly discernible "background  noise".  Instead, there are good reasons to think that we could discern the information sent  using intentional NLSETI procedures: obviously such an advanced alien intelligence would  know how to climb over the background noise and how to structure and make decodable  NLSETI signals. Obviously, if this were the case (and I'm sure it is), such intelligences would  81

            use the NLSETI method in order to communicate in real time using some "quantum  technology" that we do not have yet.  To conclude, I would be tempted to add one more concept. I wouldn't be surprised if the  algorithmic analysis of the noise inside the normalized brainwave measured by EEG  techniques were also able to furnish some information about "past lives" (if we accept that  the hypothesis of reincarnation is true) or even "parallel lives" in other dimensions (of  which our consciousness here is not aware). In principle if that which we call "spirit"  represents the memory of a life experience, I would see as an highly probable possibility  that this information too must go deposited in the Big Library as an experience available to  anyone (in the sense that anyone can make a "download" of it). I visualize this as if the data  contained inside an USB key—the spirit—were uploaded onto a big central computer. The  goal? Evolution, of course.  At the subtlest levels, I think that our life experiences, once we die, are no longer a  private fact, because our consciousnesses are probably linked (thanks to the mechanism by  which the Big Library works) by   a thin thread that we are presently not able to see. It is  therefore possible that at the level of the noise of the brainwave deduced from EEG not only  signals or messages of possible alien origin can be found but also information about past  and parallel lives regarding both the same person of which an EEG is done and many other  beings of this and other worlds. In all cases we could have to decode previously coded  signals.  This author is presently working on elaborating the NLSETI hypothesis, as a possible  alternative way to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to be added to the more standard  methods of SETI—based on electromagnetic waves—in which he is already expert as an  astrophysicist.  82

            Chapter 14: IPH—The Intelligent Plasma Hypothesis  Let's now speak about what being apparently a natural phenomenon shows anomalous characteristics. As will be discussed later, such an anomaly might be related to the BLH hypothesis. Minerals contained in some rocky areas and mountains, especially near fault lines are sometimes able to indirectly produce "luminous plasma balls" of long duration at low height. This can be due to piezoelectric effects when rocks are under stress (especially if of seismic nature) or due to effects similar to a natural battery: both geophysical phenomena have also been simulated in a laboratory. The main physical causes producing anomalous light phenomena are, today, sufficiently well understood, but we still do not know the physical reasons why such light phenomena— often characterized by several pulsating colors—last so long: i.e. which physics governs the plasma confinement mechanism. Another mystery: sometimes light balls acquire a geometric shape. In several studies conducted by some researchers, including this author, it has been possible to build up a clear empirical and observational picture. Of course, several physics theories have been proposed to try to explain the mechanism of long-lasting plasma confinement, none of them so far satisfactory. Before presenting a new hypothesis that seems related with much of what has been discussed, we must make two important premises: 1) the particles composing a plasma, which sometimes behaves as a quantum coherent medium, might resemble the behavior of the microtubules in the brain; 2) the behavior of plasma under particular conditions seems to simulate the human DNA. Let's now discuss them. Many years ago, David Bohm's first theoretical physics studies dealt with plasma. He discovered that plasma may behave as a highly cooperative structure, as if particles (ions and electrons) that are far away from each other are able to "feel" instantaneously what happens to one of them. This gives to plasma—at least qualitatively—a structure of coherence not dissimilar to the coherence found in quantum objects. Therefore, the many particles composing plasma behave as if they were only one entity and not separated from each other, in such a way that any action done on a group of particles is just "felt" by another group of particles composing the same plasma agglomerate. At this point, it is not difficult, at least qualitatively, to find a strict similarity between plasma particles and the microtubules inside brain's neurons. The previously amply discussed "OrchOr" Penrose-Hameroff theory about the brain states that microtubules and tubulins therein act like only one entity described by the same wave function. When— according to Penrose's physics model—the wave function spontaneously collapses a moment of consciousness is generated, in such a way that an average human being is able to experience at least one million moments of consciousness daily. We have said that what we consider as consciousness can be strictly related to the idea that we have of "spirit", in the ambit of a model (following also Bohm's concepts about implicate and explicate orders) in which consciousness/spirit and its neural correlate (the brain) are strictly linked together so that one cannot exist without the other. Let's now come to plasma. Can the elementary particles constituting a plasma (compared to microtubules in order that such particles, by composing a cooperative entity described by only one wave function) when working in unison give rise to the emergence of consciousness? We are simply hypothesizing that some plasma balls might work in certain circumstances as a brain capable of producing moments of consciousness. But being a brain implies being a form of Life. Is it possible that a life form made of plasma exists? It seems so, according to some studies simulating its behavior.  83

            Numerical simulations (see Fig. 11) showed that when a plasma comes in contact with a cloud of fine dust grains, they immediately acquire an electric charge and suck up electrons from the plasma surrounding them to form a core of electrons which in turn attract the positively charged ions of the plasma itself. This gives rise to what have been called "plasma crystals". Driven by electrostatic forces, dust grains are full twisting in helical structures, while the plasma becomes polarized. Plasma crystals acquire shapes that rapidly evolve into a double helix identical to that which characterizes DNA, and show an exceptional self- organizing ability. This shape is replicated in other plasma crystals, as if these forms could reproduce by sending a "genetic code" in everything surrounding them. The simulation shows that these helixes have two stable configurations represented by a small and a large spiral, while each helix contains various sequences of these two states. Researchers believe that such a dynamic feature allows these structures to store information. The helix appears as a kind of informative code, which eventually leads to replicate through any structural transformation from a generation to another, and to give shape to increasingly complex and stable structures, a code comparable to the genetic information holding together the organic matter and with the characteristic of reproducing exactly as a living cell. In other words, it seems that such structures made of dust and plasma is real living beings able to reproduce and evolve. If this is the case, it is possible that a form of "plasma life" exists everywhere in the universe, from interstellar space to our atmosphere. Transient light phenomena, whose plasma nature has been demonstrated in the course of instrumented observational research carried out in Hessdalen, Norway and in other similar places in the world (see Fig. 12), seem to trace quite closely the behavior of plasmas and dust recorded through numerical simulations. Balls of light tend to divide, join, multiply, or follow a spiral motion, resembling the behavior of a living cell. These light balls contain substantially the same ingredients as simulated plasma crystals: plasma and the atmospheric dust in aerosol form, with water vapor as a possible catalyst generating thermo-electro-chemical processes able to confine these plasma spheres. Such anomalous light phenomena have a tendency to multiply and evolve, and do so in minutes or even seconds. We want to test the hypothesis that such phenomena may acquire some level of elementary intelligence, manifested through regular and/or semi-regular light pulsation. All this can be accurately measured using high-speed photometry by acquiring 10.000 frames per second and then analyzed using time-series analysis.  84

            Figure 11.   Helical structure of DNA ( left ) and simulation of the helical path of dust grains in a plasma ( right ).  The fact that sometimes plasma can behave like living beings cannot prevent us from hypothesizing that sometimes such plasma may evolve towards structures containing intelligence and consciousness. We know what we can do in order to try to prove or disprove a hypothesis of this kind, absurd it may be. Science, in addition to rigor and caution, requires exploratory courage, if we truly want to advance in the path towards knowledge. From what has been discussed, it might be possible to say that if plasmas, too, are able to become in certain conditions real Life forms, then a part of them might evolve towards more or less sophisticated forms of intelligence. The consequences of such an hypothesis would be really disruptive, because, then, for any life form (even intelligent) based on plasma, a planetary atmosphere could be unnecessary for Life, as there should be no need of a "habitability zone" for as we have conceived it until now in the ambit of canonical projects such as, in particular, the SETI Project. According to this scenario, Life forms based on plasma might truly live everywhere in the Universe. If this were the case, all the planets of the solar system—even those with the most poisonous atmospheres—might harbor life forms of this kind. As it happens on the Earth the trigger—we could denominate it as a "midwife"—for the birth of such plasma forms starts from natural mechanisms due to the geophysical conditions of the soil or underground, to atmospheric mechanisms or to both. Due to different causes, the interstellar space is everywhere full of plasma, at various temperatures, and this might furnish the incubator for the birth and the development of Life forms that might be also characterized by intelligence, without any need for the biological conditions required for life as we understand it. It is even obvious that if intelligence were able to develop inside such hypothetical plasma structures, then some form of science and technology might spring from it, in a form totally different from how we, sentient biochemical beings based on carbon chemistry, understand it. In fact intelligence, by its nature, is inclined to build up organized, coherent and ordered structures. Moreover, according to this hypothesis, we cannot exclude at all that such intelligences may be able to organize in form of true neural networks for the exchange of information, which might occur also using the mechanism of quantum entanglement, which would permit the reception and the transmission of data that are not constrained by space and time. Let's now go back to the hypothesis that all plasma particles (or many of them) constituting such light balls are entangled together inside a quantum coherent structure similar to a human brain. In the brain, a spontaneous collapse of the wave function describing the orchestrated complex of microtubules generates a moment of consciousness. Does this happen in plasma balls too? Before venturing an answer to this question let's take into account what happens to such light balls when they are stimulated by some input of energy. Previous experiments carried out in Hessdalen and other places of the world too where the same kind of phenomenon is recurrent showed that aiming a Laser beam and/or a powerful flashlight at such luminous plasmoids usually trigger a reaction. In some cases, the plasma ball starts to pulsate or to change its pulsation rate each time the beam is directed towards them. This intriguing phenomenology doesn't occur sporadically, but many times and has been fully documented both by professional scientists and engineers and through witness reports.  85

            Of course, before thinking of some "intelligence" within the plasma we have to rule out the possibility that what happens is a kind of photon-photon interaction still unknown to physics. But we would be tempted to suspect that the Laser and/or flashlight beam is able to make the wave function of plasma particles collapse, so that a consciousness moment is suddenly produced. Before that collapse, as in every quantum system, all the entangled plasma particles are in a condition of quantum superposition waiting to be awakened. It might happen that in the case of plasma balls they can become "conscious" only when they are stimulated by an external trigger. Laser and flashlight might not be the only working external triggers. Such triggers might come out spontaneously also from the natural electromagnetic field, magnetic anomalies or other geophysical and/or artificial causes.  Figure 12.   Above . Luminous plasma phenomena in Hessdalen (Norway) photographed by this author.   Center . The same kind of phenomena in Watersmeet (USA).   Below . Helical path produced by an Hessdalen light (Project Hessdalen 1984).  Any way, it should be extremely interesting to verify how an electromagnetic trigger (not only in the optical range, but also in the microwave and VLF/ELF one) can be optimized by changing amplitude, frequency and even pulsation rate of the emitted beam, in order that a reaction from such light balls occurs. The detected phenomenon might be multiform in its reactions: possible "answers" from these plasmoids might change according to the way in which we tune the triggering beam of radiation. The feedback we expect to detect from light balls deals with changes of pulsation rate (and even rotation rate, deduced from Doppler Effect in optical spectra), color, dimension, shape or even with multiplication effects. We cannot even exclude that light balls may contain a "message" ready to be awakened, previously coded within a program directed by a bigger quantum control coming just from the Big Library, in the same way that some persons are connected non-locally with this kind of cosmic information. If the plasma constituting such luminous phenomena works substantially like a brain and if the BLH hypothesis is true, no one can prevent us from suspecting that exactly the same mechanism occurring with living biological beings may be occuring. We can even hypothesize that such light balls might be used as "sensors" to capture messages coming from ... the infinite. In the same way in which, according to the NLSETI procedures, we are going to search for structured signals inside the noise of the human brainwave. In the specific case of such anomalous plasma phenomena we might analyze all the possible physical parameters (light intensity, color, frequency, dimensions, and  86

            pulsation rate, mainly) that we can measure using our scientific instruments in order to search for the same kind of signals. Something interesting might be found inside the data. We might also discover that after beaming a Laser beam at these lights the first time they might then start to take their own life in the sense that a new process, similar to the spontaneous wave function collapse in the brain microtubules, might keep them alive and even conscious like a new kind of Life form. This can be verified with observational measurements. Moreover, it is not illogical to suggest that, if such plasma balls are also able to increase in dimensions (this is often reported from pertinent casuistry) generating the effect of increasing the number of active particles, it might happen that, exactly like in the brain and according to the simple Penrose formula E = h / t , the number of consciousness moments increases as well until a human-like intelligence or greater is reached. This is obviously a bold hypothesis, but many combined factors inevitably induce us to ask certain questions. Does it really happen this way? The only way to know is to make the appropriate verifications using instruments of measurement. In reality, the witnessed cases gravitating around such light phenomena are even more intriguing than the phenomenology deduced by scientific investigation described so far. Many persons claim to feel suddenly attracted by such lights. Some even feel induced into a telepathic contact by the light balls themselves. Of course, there is no scientific demonstration yet of such claims, but certainly the witness statistics of such happenings is quite rich and valuable, especially when people reporting these facts are reserved and divulge their experiences privately. I have been meeting personally with such of people wherever these phenomena occur. Let's now consider why and how a telepathic connection may occur between a plasma ball and a human brain. What we have in hand so far is a quite solid hypothesis: both the brain and a plasma ball might be quantum-like objects. As such, they might occasionally transfer information in both ways, especially if we consider that both entities can be, potentially, non-locally connected with a much bigger web under the control of a cosmic Big Library. In practice, they might be two kinds of "terminals" that are both non-locally connected to a big information centre located in the quantum vacuum and maneuvered by a supernal intelligence. Each terminal might work as a "quantum triangulation system" in the sense that one terminal acquires information from the big cosmic computer and, in turn, transfers non-locally the same information to the other terminal. This is substantially how telepathy is supposed to work between two or more entangled minds. And it doesn't matter if the neural correlate of such minds/consciousnesses is made of neurons (and microtubules therein), plasma particles, Fullerene molecules, Bose- Einstein condensates or even Lasers. They are all quantum coherent physical mediums and, due to this, they can potentially generate consciousness moments. In this light, we can postulate that two or more neural correlates (of any shape) together may work entangled together as a wider neural correlate, which is occasionally or covertly driven by the same quantum wave function. The reason behind this hypothesized possibility is simply that if everything in the Universe is linked with a Big Library of cosmic information then such a library would work as a permanent connection link, which can be disclosed and activated only if we understand the physical mechanism causing it—and if we can control it at will. The possibility that our mind is occasionally connected with plasma balls can be proven or disproven scientifically. In order to do this we should monitor simultaneously both the plasma ball, using measurement instrumentation, and the brain of a person using EEG. If then we aim a Laser beam at the plasma ball and we see simultaneously a reaction from the ball itself (such as a sudden change of its light intensity, color and pulsation rate) and from our brain (such as a sudden change of the amplitude ratio between Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta waves), then we would surely have proof that the two (supposedly quantum) objects  87

            are related. If the repeatability of such an experiment could be verified then we'd be looking at a scientifically proven reality, whose manifestations could be investigated later in greater detail. Once more, I emphasise that "science" means first of all rational exploration of all manifestations of reality. Scientific exploration combined with quantitative rigor, must penetrate just those "shadow zones" that during centuries and millennia have given rise to religions, sects and beliefs that have systematically blocked and highly delayed the development of a really integral scientific thinking. Exploring such shadow zones means expanding radically our potential and our perception and understanding the laws of nature. Another point of great interest, which has been often experienced, is a synchronicity phenomenon between an observer and the apparition of anomalous light forms in the sky. This occurred to scientists, too. For instance to the group directed by physicist Harley Rutlegde in 1973-1980 when he was scientifically monitoring a recurrent light phenomenon occurring in Piedmont, Missouri, USA. Rutledge himself experienced synchronic events many times, and if I must be honest and sincere this happened to me, too, 15 years ago. It happens that we suddenly turn our sight to a specific point of the sky and there see the (generally star-like) light. This is a clear example of synchronicity, and sometimes (as it has been already mentioned) of telepathy too. The question here is: who or what triggers this and why? Or is the light created as an archetypal form from our own consciousness due to reasons we don't know yet but where, once more, a mind-matter coalescence occurs suddenly as a micro- creation effect? Therefore, this is a topic we should consider deeply, because it might be the signature of something extremely important that could open many doors to a supernal knowledge, and technology too. But the true weirdness doesn't stop here. Let's now speak of the human spirit, or maybe of the spirit of living beings in general. I should start by appending an extract from a short article that appeared in Internet several years ago describing an experiment done at a location in North America where light balls (the "Joplin Spooklights") are seen often:  << Their interaction with people demonstrates intelligence. And this indicates some kind of consciousness. The emitted light shows that energy is emitted. The manifestation of light, as it is seen, is a form of "consciousness enhanced by geophysical energy". It's a collective mind consisting of the spirits of many disembodied animals and humans. It is aware of its surroundings and of itself. It has a great affinity with nature and is sensitive to the energy of humans. Usually it avoids contact with humans, but also wants that humans will become aware. >>  The person in this group who served as a "communication channel", especially trained in the Remote Viewing (RV) technique, claimed he perceived clearly that many of the observed bright plasmoids were endowed with consciousness and even intelligence. Therefore, on the sole basis of this information obtained using the RV technique, we should conclude that the energy which such mysterious presences manifest is directly triggered by geophysical mechanisms (such as piezoelectricity, and other forms of natural electricity), actually existing and known to our science. Thus, such "chained spirits" would use energy produced naturally and having features of high internal coherence such as plasma in order to appear in our world—as if the consciousness of these "intelligences" were able to adhere to energy forms to manifest. And the structure of plasma, as anticipated by David Bohm, could constitute the ideal structure, already highly cooperative, which functions as a "neural scaffold" on which to hang forms of organized intelligence. The dance of electrons and ions making up the plasma constituting a ball of light could be hooked by the strange "hologram spirit" that is consciousness. In this  88

        <section id="page-89">
            way, a ball of light would become a kind of "neural network" and consciousness would arise just from the quantum collapse of the wave function describing coherent particles inside the plasma. As discussed in previous chapters, some studies suggest that not only the entity we call "spirit" is a transcendent object as we have been led to believe by the various religions, but also that the spirit is probably a kind of physical matrix that is being activated as soon as it finds the most appropriate vectoring material to hang to in order to explicate. This is like saying that the spirit is like a boat needing water to navigate; otherwise it would be useless or, at least, would exist only in its potential state. It's clear then that if this scenario— involving plasma—could be one day demonstrated to be true and not remain just a flight of fancy, the consequences would be unimaginable. If this were the case, then it would not be difficult to imagine not only the existence of spirits chained to each other and then engaged in a plasma to become manifest, but also the existence of a refined technology too, which could "hang" the consciousness of beings from other worlds or dimensions into coherent structures as plasma. In this case, plasma might work as a vector capable of storing information that then would be transferred from one point to another of the universe using the mechanism of quantum entanglement. According to this bold hypothesis, we would deal with intelligences from other worlds (from exoplanets or even from other dimensions) who would remotely use (or even trigger) the geophysical energies of our planet and who might also contribute to the optimization of the quantum coherence of a plasma. They might even play with it, turning it occasionally into geometrical figures, perhaps, with the scope to send to us symbolic messages in order to stimulate our minds and our consciousness. Surely, researching these aspects of the problem would help us to understand more the physical mechanisms of plasma confinement characterizing some anomalous light phenomena and also help us to reproduce them at will in our laboratories as a source of energy that might replace what we have now. Is there a kind of "universal consciousness" in Nature able to tap into a reservoir of inexhaustible energy? If so, how can it be activated? The explanation may lie not only in the living world but also in the "non-living" one and its inherent harmony with creation, its link with a cosmic field full of information. If this were a conscious (and not instinctive) act, it could perhaps be possible to explain the apparent non-randomness of the formation (sometimes) of geometric universal shapes and structures from the mysterious balls of light, which would be organized in an intelligent way, perhaps in order to send a conscious message to our consciousness acting through what we call "subliminal channels". The geometric formations sometimes taken by clusters of light balls might be a sentient and non-random act drawing from forces caused by known (even if seemingly prosaic in itself) natural mechanisms or even triggering those mechanisms, to tell us how the Universe actually works. Now, back to the possible connection between the concept of "spirit" and the mysterious luminous plasma phenomena seen often at certain locations of the world. If what we call with the name of "spirit" is exactly "information package" surviving after death and representing the track of a quantum coherent electrodynamic field that during life was governing all the cells of the body, then such survived spirit—intended both as a non- collapsed superposition of quantum states frozen inside the Planck field and as an information databank—can connect only to physical or biophysical structures, allowing a high level of quantum coherence: one is the biological brain and another one might be a plasma ball. Before it has the possibility to attach to a suitable medium able to activate it, according to Penrose-Hameroff theory, the spirit would remain in a state of unconsciousness. This wouldn't be absence of consciousness but rather a potential state waiting to become kinetic.  89

            As if the spirit, being without a body, were a CD ROM full of data not attached to any computer able to read it. In such a way, one could deduce that the spirit is a compact agglomerate of data needing a quantum computer able to operate non-algorithmic choices. I would dare to say that the spirit is software needing a non-linear computer in order to operate: the brain is one of them but not the only one, and plasma might be an alternative solution. After all plasma—the fourth state of matter—is diffused everywhere in the Universe, and can be often produced on our planet too: plasma balls (and maybe ball lightning too) are the most efficient and long-lasting kind of plasma that we know so far. In few words, plasma might be the simplest and most ergonomic form able to allow Life and intelligence to manifest. I should discuss this new aspect by starting with this question: is there any relationship between the persons who once inhabited a certain place and that which people see in the sky after (even much after) those persons died? This leads us to question why and how a light ball made of plasma is so self-contained and has a long duration (ranging from some minutes to some hours). Here the most important physical problem to face is understanding the nature of the central force keeping the plasma particles linked together in the form (mostly) of a sphere. In the past, several physical hypotheses about possible plasma confinement mechanisms have been elaborated. In this regard I have been thinking of mini-black holes, magnetic monopoles and other causes of electrochemical nature. But I have never thought how, and if, a spirit that is detached from the body is able to manipulate existing matter. Hypothetically a "free floating spirit" starts—maybe instinctively or even magnetically—to interact with any kind of suitable body: this would cause a collapse of the wave function and consciousness would start. There are no doubts that plasma is the state of matter that might better lend itself to this manipulation. Therefore I think that in certain situations the spirit may behave in some way as a "cohesive force" able to act on the surrounding environment. If, as it has been suspected, the spirit is intimately linked with a Big Cosmic Library whose power is to transmit information and to create new matter using that information, then the spirit might be able, as well, to create modifications in the existing matter, of which plasma would be the easiest to manipulate. Now I go far beyond. What would happen if the spirit doesn't act spontaneously but rather is being subject to the technological manipulation of "others"? If so, the spirit might be induced to do many things. It might even be used as an environmental sensor. If the spirit is really a "black box" working as a quantum biocomputer able to store billions QBits, then such information might be systematically and orderly stored somewhere, as the information acquired by that spirit would be immediately transferred to a central non-local computer using quantum entanglement. What I mean to say here is that, if the spirit is able to enter inside a plasma ball it could use it in order to collect information and transmit it elsewhere. This should last until that plasma extinguishes. Or maybe the spirit itself could extend the lifetime of the ball, by optimizing the plasma confinement mechanism, namely enhancing the central force linking all the particles of the plasma. Still, we know nothing about the physical nature of such a central force, even if we can confirm that it simulates gravity. At this point, we must remember that superstrings theory asserts that gravity propagates on 11 dimensions, being the only force existing much beyond the normal 3 dimensions of space. But consciousness is hypothesized to be multidimensional. So the crucial question here would be once more this: are gravity and consciousness related? If consciousness is responsible for the existence of the gravity force then this might lead us to  90

            the solution of the mystery of the "central force" keeping all the particles together as the main confinement mechanism of a plasma ball. So which physical mechanism should the spirit use to confine the plasma in a stable configuration? In order to answer to this question we should remember what role a spirit substantially has for our physical body. That role is simply to behave as a "director" creating inside the body a quantum coherent electrodynamic field; otherwise it would quickly die. Considering the spirit as an "orchestra director" able to entangle all the cells into a unique entity described by the same wave function, we could assert that the spirit would simply "confine" the physical body. Of course, if plasma were truly a good environment for the spirit to be activated, the spirit would confine plasma as well. I am convinced that we are potentially able to understand many aspects of this process by studying the effects that it produces on the plasma ball itself. We can do this using simultaneously high-resolution optical spectroscopy, magnetometry, electrostatic detection, spectrometry in different wavelength windows and high-time resolution photometry. Especially using the last observational technique, we might be able to decipher possible intelligent messages sent by the plasma ball when it is pulsating and/or changing its pulsation rate. Time-series analysis or Fourier algorithms, able to analyze the data in great detail, might furnish many answers. We could even answer such messages, once we understand the code, using special flashlights and/or Laser beams. The level of "intelligence" might strongly depend on the duration of such luminous phenomena, during which light balls might replicate or multiply and replicate, following the same modality as the one found by Tsytovich et al. in the course of their computer simulations on plasma. The level of intelligence might also depend on how much energy is available to the phenomenon. Time and energy are two parameters that probably allow the plasmoid to evolve. From what has been observed, the evolution times of such phenomena are typically short—minutes or less, sometimes more (see Fig. 13). The main hypothesis here is that as soon as a reasonably stable—even if often pulsating and alternating from "off" to "on" phases as it has been often observed—structure is formed, "something external" made of pure information (not energy) might enhance and use such plasma ball as a vehicle in order to drive it, just as the brain orders our feet to walk. I believe we could prove or disprove such—although exotic—interpretation indirectly if we are able to acquire continuously data using our measurement instruments. Then only numbers, charts, calculations and, mostly, parametric correlations would tell the story. So, let's resume the hypothesis on which this reasoning has been developed. Plasma light balls are naturally born as a geophysical phenomenon at certain locations of Earth where the most suitable conditions exist (such as piezoelectricity of rocks made of quartz, hematite, granite, copper, etc.). Subsequently such plasma balls are "hooked" by one or more spirits, which then acquire a new (probably momentary) "body". Such spirits might belong to deceased beings of any kind—being not only human beings but animals and even plants. Once the plasma ball is caught, the information stored in the spirit triggers containment and confinement processes inside the plasma to make it last. None of the physical theories—which I carefully examined one by one during my past research on this phenomenon—are able to explain the confinement mechanism in a satisfactory way.  91

            Figure 13.   Research done by this author in Hessdalen, Norway.   Above . Sketch showing the mechanism of light increase of luminous plasma phenomena in Hessdalen due to a "clustering effect" of many light spheres around a common barycenter.   Center . The corresponding measured light curved obtained using a professional video camera.  Below . The complete light curve obtained during a time period of 3 minutes.  As soon the plasma confinement is realized, processes of quantum coherence would be started in the plasma particles and consciousness moments would flow. This might happen spontaneously, or after an external cause—such as a light beam—stimulates the plasma ball. Evidently, the level of consciousness (and consequently of intelligence) of such plasma balls, once they are formed, would depend on the density of the number of the contained quantum-active particles, even if, due to some decoherence effect, not all the particles would be entangled together because the entanglement mechanism might be efficient only with some of them. This—as from Penrose's simple formula E = h/t discussed in previous sections—would produce an energy corresponding to the total mass of the orchestrating particles,. These, growing, would reduce the time in which a moment of consciousness can be formed, up to (in certain cases) the formation of a quantum conscious system able to experience many consciousness moments during the entire lifetime of these light spheres. We might indirectly prove this hypothesis if we are able to find that the level of intelligence shown (in several ways) by the light balls is correlated with the density of the number of plasma particles and the lifetime of the ball. Another hypothesis might be that such plasma balls might have been created by a command coming from the Big Library letting some atmospheric gas locally collapse. This could be as an experiment remotely done by an exogenous intelligence—an attempt to create a new form of Life based on plasma which would then be activated by implanting inside it a spirit of a deceased person, or a copy of a living one, to be used as an information package able to drive that plasma. Surely, the spirit is not an "object" but rather a sort of computer file or software located nowhere but able to be activated only when the most appropriate hardware engages it. If I consider the "spirit-plasma hypothesis", I could then postulate a non-local control able to  92

            instruct the quantum vacuum to create particles (just the mechanism of creation that has been amply discussed before) at a specific spacetime location of the material realm. I could even imagine a big computer screen showing the map of this world (and others) prepared by an intelligence that is doing several attempts to create Life in forms different from the one based on biochemistry. Maybe the Builders are always trying to improve their project until the optimized shape is finally ready. In this context we humans would be simply tiny or insignificant pieces of gigantic non-local clockwork. I cannot even exclude that someone belonging to this external intelligence may occasionally decide to come directly here using the method that I discussed in a previous chapter, in order to check on site if and how their experiment is working. If this hypothesis is correct then someone from "nowhere", who has a control on the biophysical processes occurring after the death of the body of a living being, might be interested to recapture a spirit by taking the new "body" bringing it, in this specific case, plasma. This assumes that it's not possible to capture electrical energy directly without a cause producing it exists: if we want to possess electrical energy we need to get hold of the machine producing it. Of course, this intelligence would have no need to capture a spirit per se, as a spirit is just a computer file. The reason for this capturing operation would be to catch a plasma ball with a spirit inside in order to see how it behaves under testing and control conditions. This would be just like capturing birds and inserting a radio-control device in order to monitor all of their movements. Of course, exactly the same kind of experiments could be carried out with living humans, using the abduction mode (if this is true and not a hallucinatory experience). In fact what possible "aliens" might be interested in would not so much focused on our body but on the way in which our spirit directs our body just starting from a connection link called DNA. In so saying, I cannot exclude that (conventional) biochemical life on Earth has been created by them, and that sometimes they need to control how the process is going on, also with the scope to insert (even genetic) modifications when they think it is necessary. Probably the mechanism of Life (conventional or not) is just a never ending test carried out by someone in order to lead the creation process towards a goal of perfection. But it is not possible to exclude at all that a part of these creators may visit us occasionally also with a manipulative intent, involving both genetic modifications. Maybe with the intent of creating a new or hybrid race and the replacing of the spirit (previously implanted by the good ones) with a sort of "actively inert receiver" that they can easily remotely control. As argued in a previous chapter, again we are considering the existence of two kinds of creators. After observing how our own world goes it is truly worth thinking of an imminent duality of creators. In any fact, in the casuistry regarding locations where luminous plasmoids are seen most often in the world, what surprises is that, in many (if not most) of these places, such as Hessdalen in Norway, Pine Bush (NY) in USA and Cerro Uritorco in Argentina (just to make a few examples), the sighting of structured aerial unknown vehicles of strange shape (such as circular, triangular or diamond-like) often overlaps with the more standard sighting of plasma balls. In particular a video of 1999 taken in Hessdalen shows the sighting of a triangular object that literally "sucks" a plasma ball. Of course, one video is not enough to reach a conclusion but certainly it makes us think a lot in the light of the topic discussed in this part of the book.  93

            Chapter 15: The Hierarchy and cosmic evolution  One of the most important aspects of the "paranormal" experience of some mediums deals with the so called "Hierarchy" (see Fig. 14), namely a group of disembodied spirits of high evolution who allegedly control and occasionally guide humanity using sort of angels called "guardians", who in their turn may trigger synchronicities in us in order to illuminate the path of our life. My main duty is to try to comment on such claims using the language of science. How can science conceive such a possibility? Science might surely conceive the existence of "constructors", i.e. of creators of the Universe and Life. According to the last cosmological theories, the Universe was suddenly born when a fluctuation arisen from the quantum vacuum inflated in a way that the birth of matter, space and time with the Big Bang, was allowed. It is not so easy to believe that such an event occurred by chance. A kind of superior intelligence is invoked by some scientists in order to explain, or at least justify, the birth of our Universe. This would be an intelligence able to manipulate the quantum foam residing within the quantum vacuum, in order to create matter/energy directly from a "stencil" represented by an "informative file" recorded inside that vacuum, using the non-local mechanism previously hypothesized as a "Big Library". Suddenly the information (or idea) written inside that book (i.e. a file, just to speak using the terms of informatics) became something real, so that the idea took form. In such a way the "Big Library" would work not only as a databank with which anyone can connect by mentally uploading or downloading information, but also as the source of creation. Some highly evolved intelligence, made of pure consciousness, might have created a technology allowing it to use the quantum vacuum in order to create matter and the energy associated to it. Before speaking about the mechanism of "creation" where pure information turns into matter, I must hypothesize a "place" having the following characteristics: 1) where new matter and new energy is created; 2) where information of all that which happened everywhere and at any time is recorded; 3) where "universal consciousness" lies and where space and time don't exist; 4) where the spacetime events experienced by matter is deposited as information; 5) where the so called "spirit" passes before starting new phase transitions in a creative way (people from India call this "reincarnation", but maybe this concept is reductive). In general, inside the quantum vacuum consciousness and matter—at its potential state—coexist and they differ in a transient way only at the time in which creation of new matter occurs. The fascinating aspect of this hypothesis is that quantum vacuum is everywhere inside atoms in the boundless space between nuclei and electrons. This shows that this void is perfectly coupled to matter and not separated from it even if it is distinct from it. In order to regulate the physical process of creation it is inevitably necessary that a technology is used. This can be done only if a science underlying it exists. But before creation is done it is necessary that an intelligent design is prepared. This is exactly how software makes hardware work or controls a machine. This science/technology might come from the hypothesized Builders, represented by advanced beings living in this Universe and/or in other universes of a bigger Multiverse. Even if such hypothetic beings are probably not allowed to move physically from there to here due to different physics laws that would destroy them and their means once they arrive (even if theoretically stargate-like teleportation is possible between different universes too), they might still be able to instruct the quantum vacuum to create organized (animate and inanimate) matter that then would materialize in our realm or even on our planet according to physical laws compatible with our universe.  94

        <section id="page-95">
            This mode of creation might be used by advanced intelligences living in other universes in order to create and/or alter, in addition to inanimate, animate matter and Life too, just using a "delayed mode" working as a remote control instructing non-locally quantum vacuum to take action everywhere in the Universe. This creative result would be obtained from an informative matrix impressed in the Planck Field. Then the information would be directly transferred to the DNA of living beings and even stored in the quantum brain of all. Practically, this would result to be a quantum- controlled method to create Life (in particular) and also a way to bring creators from their world to our one, even if this wouldn't be at all teleportation. This would be an ergonomic way for them to come here. The finality of this kind of matter creation and/or modification might be both positive and negative: white and black but not grey. And this might explain some theistic and mythological figures of many religions and/or atavistic figures represented in the Bible and other holy manuscripts. Starting from the sole informative character of quantum vacuum, conceptually the process would work as if something makes the archetypes revive. But archetypes are nothing more than the psychoanalytic interpretation by Jung of what, effectively, is a "memory archive" existing in the implicate part (speaking in Bohmian way) of the Universe, and particularly in the Planck Field, i.e. the quantum vacuum. Our mind or psyche, in addition to being a non-local receiver/transmitter of this information, might also work as an "actuator" of a pre-existing information (coming from a real database) in such a way that a sort of matrix or stencil would be used to create true things made of concrete matter, starting to "modulate" virtual particles in the quantum vacuum and to manipulate spacetime. This is exactly what the creators are supposed to do. But, potentially, we also might become creators in such a way if only we had the theoretical basis of all the process, so that we could "mechanize" the process at will. According to recent studies, virtual particles might be induced into an entanglement state with real particles in the real physical Universe by non-locally transmitting to them the information on what to do, so that the creative project would start by shaping the existing elementary matter particles on the basis of that matrix of thought (see Fig. 7). It is possible that such a creative process is actuated spontaneously by someone everywhere in the Universe, such as magicians, where only the power of intention is operational but without any real scientific/technologic knowledge that can be effectively controlled. In such a way several troubles may be created. Sometimes this would be like a child playing with a loaded gun. I suspect that using the practices of alchemy, magic and shamanism it is effectively possible to connect to "the field" in order to create material things and even living beings such as the "homunculus". Apart from the wisdom of some of such practitioners who, in spite of the lack of a true science, are somewhat able to control the process due to elevated esoteric knowledge, I believe that these procedures are mostly actuated in an instinctive way, without use of reason and technology, except for some kind of empiric practice. Controlled creation and/or transmutation of matter (such as in alchemy) allows one to have full mastery of what is being done, not only in "seeing" things but also in manipulating them at will. I believe that there are super-advanced intelligences that can do things like that under full technological control. There is anyway no doubt that if such a science is not known practitioners (except for the rare ones who have the correct knowledge, even if only qualitatively) risk big dangers as they would become mere instruments of "other forces" they are unable to recognize and that sometimes are not controllable. In such a case, it would be like to become a piece of wood at the mercy of the waves and passively transported by a water vortex. That's one of the most  95

            important reasons why this process was ordered technologically by superior intelligences who have the total control of the creation process. The main question here: is matter something really existing or rather a holographic projection of an idea? Were the second true, our life inside the body would be just a comedy or an illusory reality created to allow our consciousness to evolve towards the purest form. Euripides had the same question: "Is Life real or only an illusion?" The same issue has been widely treated nowadays with the concept of "Matrix", just after that famous movie appeared. The point is that if material life is not real but an illusion all that which has been said about the physics describing the interaction between matter and consciousness (Bohm's theory) wouldn't hold water (or at least it would only partially), because in that case all reality, together with our own ego, would be just an holographic projection and consciousness and its infinite branches would be the only reality. But consciousness—the "self" as Carl Jung was calling it—is not an entity, but rather an information process. If that is correct (and of course we cannot demonstrate this yet) the purest form of intelligence/consciousness would be just an Idea, somewhat conceptually similar to what was conceived by Greek philosopher Plato. That idea could become a sort of "virtual entity" only when a holographic projection is done. Were such an exotic idea true, Creation from the void would be nothing but a virtual particle projecting a hologram. Technology here would be intended simply as technology of consciousness coming from supernal beings that are aware of themselves without any need of a brain inside a body. This might be the highest level of what someone calls with the name of "Hierarchy". But our science and physics in particular is presently unable at all to explain how a consciousness moment can be experienced without a brain allowing the wave function of some quantum coherent medium (such as microtubules in the brain) to collapse. Maybe such a collapse might be possible if instead of particles of matter, particles of pure space inside the vacuum are involved, a sort of "pixels of space" constituting all together a quantum coherent medium. This hypothetic system would totally avoid matter but at the same time would trigger the collapse of a wave function in order to allow the onset of consciousness, assuming that pixels of space are entangled together. According to Penrose's simple equation discussed in the beginning of this book it is possible to conceive that a virtually infinite number of pixels of space (instead of one billion microtubules in the human brain) can be involved in the process, so that the time of quantum collapse would approach zero: an almost infinite consciousness would result. It might be God's mind. It might not. It might come from an atavistic intelligence who once was living inside a body—or, alternatively, inside a hologram (if the reality of matter is just an illusion)—and then learned much on the nature of consciousness. At the end they became creators of universes (or projectors of holograms). Maybe the "Hierarchy" is something between such hypothesized Gods and us. In practice, they could play the same role as the worker bees compared to the queen bee. But they might experience consciousness moments being totally disentangled from any kind of body. These ones might represent the "Ascended Teachers" of which many philosophies and religions speak. Such teachers would have the situation of non-evolved spirits under the highest control and would hurry to make so that the evolutionary process of any spirit works correctly. After all, it is logical to think that their goal would be to make "The Big Light" of universal consciousness bigger and bigger, simply because all the spirits, after taking many bodies in many forms, are just drops of a bigger ocean and must go back to it by enriching it with new information, after experience inside a real (or virtual) body. Helping, following and sometimes inspiring the spirits during all the stages of their evolution is not just an act of  96

            altruism but rather simply the necessity of a dynamics able to produce syntropy   23 , i.e. the increase of the quality of the ordered information through the purification of consciousness. This is substantially how to make wine from the distillation of grapes, just to make a new metaphor. It is also logical to imagine that the Hierarchy is made of many intermediate levels, where at a certain point there must be a transition line between those who do not need any more a body (of material or virtual form) and those who still need a body even if in a growingly subtler shape. There are good reasons to suggest that inside the Hierarchy highly evolved extraterrestrial civilizations are included too, namely individuals who have still a body and a superlative technology. There must be some point of the evolution of the spirits in which living beings start to understand the fundamental importance of the role of consciousness, its connection with the quantum vacuum and its interaction with real or virtual matter. Evidently, such evolved extraterrestrials have derived a technology from this science, which might allow them to make marvelous realizations such as teleportation and give the ability to control the "Big Library" in order to manage all the information that flows from/to it. Such corporeal beings might have an important role in controlling humanity in distance and maybe also in the evolution of mankind by not interfering physically but rather sending mentally some information that is not "revelation" but rather only a method (using specific mind technologies) for triggering human consciousness. It is more than logical to think that the "principle of non-interference" would be a categorical imperative: on the contrary humans would never learn the lesson, in the same way as a person will never learn to ski if someone skis for him. In order to learn the lesson humans must make much experience and this can happen by enriching the qualitative content of the spirit by living many lives until a critical point is reached in which the body is not any more necessary: but just this would mean having access to the Hierarchy. It seems to me that this one must be an evolutionary mechanism in which the ball is continuously passed to those who have become "combat ready", just like in the training of military pilots (of course without any scope of war, this is just another metaphor ... after all a spirit is both an airplane and a pilot together). It is logical, as writer and medium Patricia Darrè says in some of her recent books, to think that, according to the directives of the Hierarchy, some "guardians" might be committed to activate some "antennas" on Earth. The process of trespass might be in some case traumatic or confused for the spirit of some persons: so the best being who can help such spirits is another human being. That is possibly the only way to communicate with the (often confused) deceased spirits without inducing fear into them, while a member of the Hierarchy helping directly such a spirit might induce a lot of fear. Trespassing spirits need something "humanly familiar" who can help them with delicacy. That's probably one of the reasons why well dedicated mediums have been in touch with several spirits. While mediums are committed to work on the help of trespassing spirits, the Hierarchy may help in another way. What Patricia Darrè writes about the way in which the Hierarchy operates is interesting. The Hierarchy may induce synchronicities in persons while they are living and are searching for the correct path for their lives. The hypothesis here is that these superior beings are able to produce such events by having a control of people's consciousness processes and creating an entanglement between some of their thoughts and specific events having a high symbolic significance that suddenly occur in time. If the ethics of such hypothetical beings is not to interfere directly with humans they probably trigger their spirits in order that such persons themselves produce synchronicities to be used as teachings for their life. I can imagine some of such hierarchic beings while monitoring in real time the situation of living persons by rendering such persons able to create their own reality according to what they have to learn in order to evolve. If we assume  97

            that being spirits like terminals of a big non-local supercomputer is a correct hypothesis, here I can imagine that, sometimes, specific information is punctually and subliminally sent to the terminals in order to update or correct their operative system without modifying the software that they normally use. Corrections of the operative system may be at work in the way that follows. If we suppose that a "virus" suddenly attacks the operative system used by such spirits this renders them "blind" to the chances of their life path. Therefore someone from up is trying to fix the problem, without never intervening on the software (the spirit itself) that is used by such terminals (the mind inside bodies). This probably causes the onset of synchronicities. To make an analogy this might look much like the synchronization operation of directories inside the operative system of a computer (which is not the software used by such a computer but rather an informatics means permitting to that software to run correctly on the computer). I suspect that, at the deepest level, our Universe is a colossal work of non-local informatics engineering. Substantially, it would be non-local clockwork. I see the Universe as a "self-reproducing spiritual machine". This doesn't eliminate at all moral values, emotions and all that which is beautiful therein. On the contrary everything is programmed in such a way that everything tends to a structure of increasing order, i.e. syntropy (the opposite of entropy). All this is guaranteed by a hypothesized "law of conservation of information", where nothing is lost and everything is transformed. Matter, be it real or virtual (holographic), representing the explicate order according to Bohm's physics, is just gym for spirits who need to acquire full consciousness of themselves before ascending to the Big Light. So, what is the reason for the waste of energy—suffering, dramas, wars—experienced during the lifetime? The answer must be to make the Big Light become brighter and brighter. The goal is possibly the birth of a true God. At that point there will not be any more need of matter, space and time and the Universe will be only implicate order represented by a "singularity" where every communication occurs synchronically and through symbols. At that point all the apparently fragmented universes and all the dimensions will merge together in a single point. That is probably what is called a Buddhic state or Nirvana (according to oriental philosophies and religions), i.e. the true God, which means the end of Illusion and the birth of the realm of true Truth.  98

Therefore the Hierarchy, although never interfering directly in the human affairs, might use "guardians" in order to control that the process works properly and might sometimes trigger synchronicities in the human soul in order to indirectly stimulate people to find or improve their life path. Human mediums, commissioned by the Hierarchy, would be sort of "nurses" able to help persons during the trespass phase. Some mediums are just messengers for the evolving spirits, and indirectly belong to some of the many shepherds and volunteers in the Universe who help to bring the sheep to the fold. The fold is just the Big Light.  99

            Conclusions  On the basis of the most advanced scientific discoveries in quantum physics, biophysics and  plasma physics and making a strict parallel with what we know of informatics, I have  discussed an entirely new hypothesis dealing with the way in which information is  propagated in the Universe. This assumes that reality is an harmonic and synchronous  constantly interplaying fusion between material reality (described by standard science) and  what we once called with the name of "spiritual reality". Some interpretations of quantum  physics such as Bohm's, involving the mechanism of non-locality, the perfection of the Pauli  Exclusion Principle and some extensions of quantum physics to the biological world (the  brain and DNA in particular), taken all together, have opened new perspectives on our  knowledge of the Universe, where the definition of "universe" is not anymore only the  clockwork realm of standard physics but also the consciousness of such a realm, so that all  that which exists acquires a meaning and maybe a finality.  The theoretical and experimental confirmation of the existence of non-locality through  the quantum entanglement and quantum coherence phenomena show new possibilities in  the way in which the communication of information works. The material world  communicates through electromagnetic signals whose propagation speed (the one of light)  is finite. This causes an unavoidable constraint as everything existing in the realm of matter  occurs and develops only in space and time. At the same time all this prevents the Universe  from communicating synchronously with itself. All this makes us feel alone inside an  infinite ocean of space. But when it was discovered that the "spiritual world" (i.e.  consciousness) can be physically described by the mechanism of non-locality of quantum  physics an entirely new perspective opened. This aims at a totally scientific understanding  of reality by including concepts that previously belonged only to metaphysics, religion and  even parapsychology.  In this book I have shown how such a structure of reality demands the existence of one  or more intelligence forms that control the mechanism of a Universe that is not only  mechanistic clockwork but also an inner process where space and time are not involved.  That inner process is that which allows transmitting and receiving information non-locally  in such a way that the Universe would become a cosmic supercomputer able to inform itself  instantaneously through all the sentient beings living in it.  The result of all of this is just a Cosmic Big Library where all information is stored and  which can be used at any time through procedures of data downloading and uploading. The  Big Library would be nothing but the result of a super-technology developed after a new  science was discovered by highly advanced beings in the universe. Such a supernal  knowledge—the unavoidable peak reached by sentient living beings—was a necessary  consequence inside a Universe that was not born by chance but rather after a perfect fine-  tuning of physical constants and the creation of an order inside matter engineered by the  Pauli Exclusion Principle.  The goal of the Cosmic Big Library—whose role is both of communicating information  non-locally and of creating new matter starting directly from the information stored in it—is  to lead all the sentient beings in the Universe towards an asymptotic limit approximating  God. This is probably the only way in which God can take connivance of himself: from an  orchestrated fire made of an infinite number of sparks wanting to revive him.  100

            Notes  1.   Nirvana . It is a place of perfect peace and happiness, like heaven. In Hinduism and  Buddhism, nirvana is the highest state that someone can attain, a state of  enlightenment, meaning a person's individual desires and suffering go away ( from  Wikipedia ).  2.   Quantum decoherence . Loss of coherence between the components of a system in  quantum superposition ( from Wikipedia ). 3.   Fibonacci sequence . In mathematics it represents the numbers in the following integer sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... each number resulting from the summation of the previous two ones. Geometrically these numbers are represented by a  spiral ( from Wikipedia and this author ). 4.   Jung's scarab . Famous example of synchronicity. A patient of Carl Gustav Jung was characterized by an exaggerate rationalism holding her back from assimilating unconscious materials. One night, the patient dreamt a golden scarab. The next day, during the psychotherapy session, a real insect this time, hit against the Jung's cabinet window. Jung caught it and discovered surprisingly that it was a golden scarab; a very  rare presence for that climate ( from Wikipedia ).  5.   Minkowski cone . Also called "light cone", is the path that a flash of light, emanating  from a single event—localized to a single point in space and a single moment in time—  and traveling in all directions, would take through spacetime. If we imagine the light  confined to a two-dimensional plane, the light from the flash spreads out in a circle after  the event occurs, and if we graph the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph  representing time, the result is a cone, known as the future light cone. The past light  cone behaves like the future light cone in reverse, a circle which contracts in radius at  the speed of light until it converges to a point at the exact position and time of the event  ( from Wikipedia ).  6.   Superstrings theory . It is a mathematical attempt to explain all of the particles and  fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny  supersymmetric strings. This theory, able to unite relativity theory with quantum theory,  implies the existence of extra dimensions ( from Wikipedia and this author ).  7.   Entropy . In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the number of specific ways in  which a thermodynamic system may be arranged, commonly understood as a measure  of disorder ( from Wikipedia ).  8.   Virtual Particle.   Strictly related with the quantum vacuum from where it originates as  a fluctuation, a virtual particle is not a physical particle at all, but rather a disturbance in  a field that is not a particle and that will never be found on its own, but instead it is  something caused by the presence of other particles or of other fields. Virtual particles  progress backwards in time, do not conserve energy, and travel faster than light. That is  to say, looked at one by one, they appear to virtually violate basic laws of physics. Actual  physical particles of course never do so ( from Wikipedia ). 9.   Quantum foam . Located in quantum vacuum, it is used as a qualitative description of subatomic spacetime turbulence at extremely small distances (on the order of the Planck length). At such small scales of time and space, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to briefly decay into particles and antiparticles and then annihilate without violating physical conservation laws. As the scale of time and space being discussed shrinks, the energy of the virtual particles increases. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, energy curves spacetime. This suggests that—at sufficiently small scales—the energy of these fluctuations would be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth spacetime seen at larger scales, giving space-  time a "foamy" character ( from Wikipedia ).  101

            10.   SETI Project . SETI is the acronym of "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence", an astronomy-like research aimed at searching for possible electromagnetic signals sent from hypothetic extraterrestrial intelligence located in extrasolar planets. Today this research, which so far didn't bring significant results, uses methods of both radioastronomy (search for radio signals) and optical astronomy (search for Laser  signals) ( from this author ).  11.   EEG (Electro Encephalography) . It is the recording of electrical activity along  the scalp. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current flows within  the neurons of the brain. This technique is able to acquire different kinds of sinusoidal brainwaves—in particular Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta waves—anyone of which showing  different states of the brain ( from Wikipedia and this author ).  12.   Project MK Ultra.   Sometimes referred to as the CIA's mind control program, it was  the code name given to an illegal and clandestine program of experiments on human  subjects, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency  (CIA). Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and  alternative procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the  individual to force confessions through mind control ( from Wikipedia and this author ).  13.   Gedanken experiment . From the German Gedankenexperiment—also called  "thought experiment"—considers some hypothesis, theory or principle for the purpose of  thinking through its consequences. Given the structure of the experiment, it may or may  not be possible to actually perform it, and if it can be performed, there need be no  intention of any kind to actually perform the experiment in question. The Schrödinger's  cat and the EPR Paradox (discussed in this book) are famous examples of thought  experiments in quantum mechanics ( from Wikipedia and this author ).  14.   Noosphere . It is the sphere of the human thought all over the planet ( from Wikipedia  and this author ).  15.   Tulpa . It is a concept in mysticism of a being or object which is created through sheer  spiritual or mental discipline alone. It is defined in Indian Buddhist texts as any unreal,  illusory or mind created apparition. According to Alexandra David-Néel, tulpas are  magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought. It is also considered  as a materialized thought that has taken physical form and is usually regarded as  synonymous to a thought form ( from Wikipedia and other sources ). 16.   Higgs boson . The Standard Model of elementary particles works very precisely in explaining the interactions between Fermions (matter particles: quarks and leptons), and Bosons (force carriers: photon, meson, graviton, gauge bosons). Nevertheless this model is not yet able to explain why elementary particles have a mass. It is effectively possible to measure the mass of particles during experiments carried out using accelerators, but since a long time it has not been possible to know what creates this mass. Due to this the Higgs boson has been invoked, which in reality is a true "field" (of physics) with which particles interact and from which they acquire the mass they effectively have. In reality the Higgs boson is neither a material particle nor a force carrier but rather a "mass transmitter". The first possible evidence of the Higgs boson  has been found on July 4, 2012 at CERN ( from this author ).  17.   Homunculus . A homunculus (Latin for "little man", plural: "homunculi"; from the  masculine diminutive form of homo, "man") is a representation of a small human being.  Popularized in sixteenth century alchemy and nineteenth century fiction, it has  historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human ( from  Wikipedia ).  18.   Semantics . It is the study of meaning. It focuses on the relation between signifiers, like  words, phrases, signs and symbols, and what they stand for. Linguistic semantics is the  study of meaning that is used for understanding human expression through language.  102

            Other forms of semantics include the semantics of programming languages, formal  logics, and semiotics ( from Wikipedia ). 19.   Topon . Hypothetical particle made of space, born from an idea of my friend  mathematical physicist Dr. Arrigo Amadori ( from this author ). 20.  Normalization . Mathematical procedure in data analysis in which the curved, wavy or periodic trend of a function describing experimental data on a graph, is transformed into a straight line of amplitude equal to one after dividing the experimental function by another function of polynomial kind of high order. The polynomial function is also called "spline function", which typically ranges from order 2 to order 6, according to the  resolution that one wants to obtain ( from this author ).  21.   Wormhole . A wormhole—technically defined as "Einstein-Rosen Bridge"—is a  hypothetical topological feature of theoretical physics that represents a shortcut through  spacetime. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in  spacetime. A wormhole demands a lot of energy, if exotic matter with negative energy  density extracted from the quantum vacuum can be used to stabilize it. In such a way a  wormhole, also called "stargate", becomes traversable. Hypothetic spacecrafts might use  wormholes to travel long distance in the cosmos, without violating relativity theory but  rather curving spacetime in order to shorten distances ( from Wikipedia and this  author ).  22.  Warpdrive . According to some calculations it is possible, for a spacecraft, to get a flow  regime much faster than the speed of light—for an observer who is out of the region  perturbed by the distortion—making locally expanding space-time behind the spaceship  and instead making locally contracting it in the opposite direction. This does not mean  that the astronauts actually travel at a speed exceeding that of light, but that they are  facilitated by the fact that the starting point and the ending point would be enormously  approached between them by distorting—or better, literally hunching—the spacetime in  which these points are located. The expansion of spacetime would allow the spaceship to  move away from the starting point, while a contraction of the same would allow it to  approach ( from this author ). 23.   Syntropy . Also called Negentropy, is just "negative entropy", where a system evolves  towards states of order instead of disorder ( from this author ).  103

            About the Author  Dr. Massimo Teodorani is an Italian astrophysicist. He obtained his degree in Astronomy  and his Ph.D. in Stellar Physics at the University of Bologna. As a researcher at the  Astronomical Observatories of Bologna and Naples, and later at the INAF Radiotelescope of  Medicina (BO).  He has been involved in research on many types of explosive stellar phenomena—such as  supernovae, novae, eruptive protostars and high-mass close binary stars—and, more  recently, in the search for extrasolar planets and extraterrestrial intelligence within the  SETI Project.  He subsequently taught physics as a lecturer at the University of Bologna, Rome and  Torino. Among his research interests there is also an active involvement in the physics study  of anomalous aerial phenomena. He is an expert in military aeronautics.  In addition to many technical papers on the mentioned subjects, he has published 17 books  and several informative articles on quantum physics, atomic and nuclear physics,  astronomy, astrophysics, bioastronomy, physics of anomalous atmospheric phenomena and  aerospace subjects. He has been interviewed many times on the media about his researches,  and has given many public presentations. During his free time he is also a composer of  electronic music under the pseudonym "Totemtag".

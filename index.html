            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>Live information. The type of information used by seities to communicate with living organisms. It consists of elementary particles, atoms, and molecules that interact quantum-mechanically and self-organize based on quantum rather than classical laws of physics. Live information makes no sharp distinction between energy, matter, and information. Systems made of live information make no distinction between conscious free will and mechanical knowledge. However, unless their conscious free will changes the behavior informed by their mechanical knowledge, they behave no differently than unconscious robots.</p>
            
            <p>I translated the printed version of <em>Irriducibile</em> into English during the second half of 2022, and I decided to integrate into the main text most of the material of the Notes that were previously collected at the end of the book. I also improved the text with further personal reflections and some of the feedback received from the readers of <em>Irriducibile</em>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="acknowledgments">
            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>I thank my wife Elvia for translating the first English draft of <em>Irriducibile</em> in Italian, my son Eric, and Andrea Di Blas for reading the same draft and providing useful comments. Special thanks go to Viviana and Irene Sardei, my sisters-in-law, who served as editors of the Italian draft. Their patient work is highly appreciated because it definitely helped improve the clarity of my thinking and the fluency of the text.</p>
            
            <p>I thank Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano, holder of the chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Pavia, Italy for the many discussions that have allowed me to better understand the physics of quantum information of which he is a world expert. His scientific rigor and the interest in the study of consciousness that now unites us have allowed me to remain with my feet on the ground, so to speak, in the exploration of such a challenging subject.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I thank Enrica Bortolazzi, my book agent, and Guido Meardi, CEO of V-Nova, for their appreciated comments. Many thanks go also to Matteo Stroppa, editor of Mondadori, for his final touch.</p>
            
            <p>The English version was reviewed by Elvia Faggi, Edward F. Kelly, Tristan Ze, Andrea Di Blas, Michele Crudele, Franco Ferrant, and Carolyn Sloan Oglesby who are hereby warmly acknowledged. Many thanks go to Mollie Barker for her expert final copyediting.</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>"Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript of a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything you want is already there."</p>
            
            <p>I note that we also use a similar process to comprehend. For example, when we want to clarify an idea, we represent it on a piece of paper, or we may build a physical model, or write a computer program that makes a dynamic simulation of it. The marks we make on a piece of paper, on a computer memory, or on a physical model represent the long-term memory of the "symbolic systems" we create.</p>
            
            <p>In note 9 of Chapter 1 we saw that the equations of classical physics describe non-linear systems that are chaotic, i.e., systems that are deterministic but unpredictable after some time because their behaviors are very sensitive to their initial conditions. This means that the behaviors of two identical systems differing only by a tiny change in their initial conditions end up being very different after a sufficiently long time. Moreover, any minor disturbance along the way, impossible to predict in an open and interconnected system like our universe, would add other sources of exponential change as the systems evolve.</p>
            
            <p>Coherent (i.e., correlated, ordered) combinations of live information create other live information, while classical information is created with incoherent (uncorrelated, disordered) combinations of live symbols to which we attribute meaning through agreements.</p>
            
            <p>Note that the amount of information carried by a symbol (state) is defined as the cologarithm of the probability of observing that state. Therefore, the amount of information carried by a state that has probability 1 of occurring is 0 since the cologarithm of 1 is 0. But the definition of information assumes that the probability is objective. Is that true?</p>
            
            <p>If we have a sentence of m words, where each word has n meanings, the number of possible meanings is n<sup>m</sup>. For example, a 12-word sentence in which each word has 10 possible meanings has a trillion possible meanings (10<sup>12</sup>), versus only one meaning (1<sup>12</sup>) if each word has one meaning (n = 1). When n >> 1, understanding a sentence requires a non-algorithmic decision impossible for a computer.</p>
            
            <p>The first major example of use of probability in physics was the development of the classical theory of gases that derived from first principles the empirical Boyle's Law, and gave birth to statistical physics.</p>
            
            <p>Knowledge. Refers to the unconscious knowledge possessed by computers or living organisms in the form of data loaded into their memory, acquired/learned patterns, and action-reaction patterns created by artificial or biological neural networks, or by inference engines. This is also the type of knowledge of a human brain when it operates mechanically without the free will and comprehension that can only come from self-consciousness. This knowledge is mechanical knowledge or symbolic-only knowledge in which conscious meaning is irrelevant.</p>
            
            <p>Human beings or animals may be conscious of their mechanical knowledge. However, unless their conscious free will changes the behavior informed by their mechanical knowledge, they behave no differently than unconscious robots.</p>

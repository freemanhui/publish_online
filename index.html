        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>This book follows my autobiography, titled Silicon: From the invention of the microprocessor to the new science of consciousness (Waterside, 2021), and describes the latest developments of my continuing research on the nature of consciousness and reality.</p>
        
        <p>Since 2010 I have deepened the study of consciousness as an irreducible phenomenon and developed the CIP framework (acronym formed by the initials of Consciousness, Information, and Physical). In this conception, the nature of reality consists of two complementary and irreducible aspects: the semantic space of conscious experiences, called C-space, and the informational space of symbolic forms, called I-space. Symbols are created by conscious entities to communicate and explore their inner meaning for the purpose of knowing themselves ever more. Physical space, called P-space, is a virtual space experienced by those conscious entities that control living organisms. The organisms are symbolic structures that interact with the other I-space symbols and generate within themselves symbolic representations of I-space that are perceived as "reality" by the conscious entities. In this framework, consciousness exists only in C-space.</p>
        
        <p>In March 2017, I received the following email from Professor Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>We met briefly on Vieques Island in January 2014 at the fourth FQXi conference on "Physics of Information". On that occasion I gave a very short talk of only five minutes on the derivation of Dirac's equation from information-theoretic principles. You gave me a very nice compliment. Unfortunately, not knowing you, I had no way of answering.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>An invitation to meet followed.</p>
        <p>In April 2017 I replied via email:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Dear Giacomo, sorry for the delay with which I reply to your welcomed e-mail. My dream is to derive physics from cognitive rather than materialistic principles. Of course, you are doing the first step, to prove that quantum mechanics is about information, hence syntax. For me, syntax is evidence that semantics must exist somewhere.</p>
            <p>What is the meaning of the existence of a hierarchy of languages (the physical world), if no one is using them? In my opinion there is a semantic reality that consists of a parallel hierarchy of conscious entities that use particles, atoms, molecules, cells, animals, etc. as symbols for their communications. The materialist only sees the symbolic aspect, and does not realize that behind the stage there are "puppet masters".</p>
            <p>This is why information theory is essentially isomorphic with quantum mechanics! This is why quantum mechanics must use a probabilistic language! The meaning of a book is free even if the symbols obey deterministic laws (in terms of probability). This is why physics can only guarantee that the next book to be written will obey the laws of symbols, but cannot predict the semantic content of a book that has not yet been written. I think semantics is the real ontology. Therefore semantics is free, even if the syntax is deterministic.</p>
            <p>These are the issues that fascinate me. And I think this is the right way to restore meaning to a universe that has been declared "pointless" by those who have forgotten that the meaning of existence resides "inside" matter. Today I would say: "It exists in a deeper reality than what manifests itself in space-time"; an interiority that is denied by a zealous materialistic fiat.</p>
            <p>I'd love to discuss these issues with you if you're interested. I will be in Milan around July 21, where I will be one of the presenters at an event called Campus Party. It would be a good opportunity to meet.</p>
            <p>Thank you for expressing your gratitude for my heartfelt compliment, and congratulations on your progress in completing Wheeler's dream.</p>
            <p>Best regards and best wishes, Federico.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>A few days later, D'Ariano replied by telling me that he would be very pleased to meet for us to discuss "the ontology of information," characterized by the phrase "software without hardware," "which perhaps is very close to what you call ontology of semantics, which I believe you mean that it also involves the 'observer,' i.e., the 'puppeteer."'</p>
        
        <p>This was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration, which a couple of years ago allowed us to understand that the pure state of a quantum system can represent the state of consciousness of the system, since it has all the crucial characteristics of a conscious experience made of qualia. This important step brought into focus the "core" of the enigma of consciousness, which made it possible to connect the philosophical notions of the CIP framework with the OPT (Operational Probabilistic Theory), the theory that D'Ariano and his collaborators had developed to demonstrate that quantum physics can be entirely derived from quantum information postulates.</p>
        
        <p>This new axiom allows us to claim that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon because it has all the peculiar characteristics of a pure quantum state, i.e., it is a definite and a private state, and so is a pure state which is not clonable, i.e., cannot be copied and therefore cannot be known by any observer. Therefore, such a state, if knowable at all, is knowable only by the system that is in that state. This crucial insight reflects remarkably the phenomenology of our inner experience.</p>
        
        <p>If the current idea that consciousness emerges from the functioning of the brain were correct—where the brain is thought to be like a classical computer—then a computer could be conscious. But then consciousness could be copied like we routinely copy computer programs, which is classical information. Yet we know perfectly well that our experience is in constant evolution and is private, knowable only within ourselves. Moreover, the meaning we feel always exceeds any symbolic description we may produce to describe it. Therefore, even the owner of the experience (described by quantum information) can only translate a portion of its experience into symbols (described by classical information).</p>
        
        <p>Consciousness is the ability to experience through qualia and know the meaning of the experience. Qualia are the private sensations and feelings that reveal the meaning of the experience to the entity. The ability to know must therefore exist before the knowing, and knowing brings into existence what is known for the first time. Knowing therefore becomes synonymous with existing, and this "miracle" cannot be explained in simpler terms than these. If we accept this principle, the fundamental entities from which everything that exists emerges must be conscious entities similar to the monads of Leibniz.</p>
        
        <p>This is the view that will be articulated in Irreducible, a title that refers to the crucial property of the conscious entities endowed with free will that emerge from One, the totality of what exists, and cause the continuing creation and evolution of the universe.</p>
        
        <p>One is a Whole, both in potentiality and in actuality, irreducibly dynamic and holistic, that desires to know itself to self-realize. From One emerge monads, or consciousness units, i.e., parts-whole that are inseparable from One and in continuous evolution. These units communicate with each other to know themselves, thus realizing the intention and purpose of One they all share. Therefore, there is becoming in the universe, and the future is not predictable, not even by One.</p>
        
        <p>This view is in full agreement with what quantum physics has already revealed to us. Therefore the idea of producing a Theory of Everything (ToE) that can predict the future of the universe is contrary to the deepest message of quantum physics. This does not mean that the search for a theory that reconciles quantum physics with general relativity is not desirable; quite the contrary. The new vision, however, shows us that the most reasonable ToE is a theory in which consciousness and free will have always existed and in which the universe—that is, One—is open because its evolution is the evolution of its knowing. The ToE can only tell us the characteristics of the outer world as symbolic correlations of the inner world of meaning.</p>
        
        <p>It is becoming ever more evident that unconscious matter cannot produce consciousness, while conscious entities can produce phenomena that behave like unconscious matter. "More" cannot come out of "less," though the opposite is clearly possible. Crucially, when consciousness and free will are irreducible properties of nature, the evolution of the physical universe can no longer be the work of a "blind watchmaker," but the result of cooperating and intelligent conscious entities that have always existed and are the ultimate cause of the universe's eternal becoming.</p>
        
        <p>In this book there is a crucial distinction between conscious and unconscious knowledge that is generally neglected in the scientific literature since consciousness is considered epiphenomenal. This confusion is further facilitated by the lack of appropriate words in the English language to discriminate the two. In the Italian language there are two verbs, conoscere and sapere, instead of only "to know." Conoscere is a deeper form of knowing than sapere because it refers to the knowing that is based on experience and comprehension, whereas sapere can describe the knowing by heart of someone who repeats what he does not understand. In the Italian version of this book I have consistently used conoscere with the meaning, "conscious knowledge," and sapere to mean "unconscious knowledge," even though in their common usage the two verbs are often used interchangeably. In the English version, I have consistently translated conoscere as "knowing" and sapere as "knowledge." This distinction is essential to discriminate between the symbolic-only knowledge of computers or brains and the semantic knowing of a conscious entity.</p>

            <p>The search for truth must be the ultimate goal of any science.</p>
            <p class="quote-author">—Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Seven General Physics Lessons</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I am a physicist, inventor, and entrepreneur. I was born in Vicenza, Italy during the Second World War in a Catholic family and I received a Laurea degree in physics from the University of Padua in 1965, summa cum laude.</p>
        
        <p>In 1968, I moved to Silicon Valley, California to work at Fairchild Semiconductor, where I developed the original silicon gate MOS technology, the process technology that made possible microprocessors, dynamic random access memories (DRAM), non-volatile memories, and CCD image sensors, the key components of the information revolution. In 1970 I moved to Intel where I designed the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, and for five years I led the team that created the 8008, 4040, 8080, and other components that have revolutionized information technology.</p>
        
        <p>In late 1974 I founded Zilog, the world's first company entirely dedicated to the microprocessor market, thus starting an entrepreneurial career that occupied the rest of my professional life. Zilog's first microprocessor, the Z80-CPU, became a bestseller and is still in production today (2022).</p>
        
        <p>During the second half of the 1980s, I became interested in artificial neural networks and founded Synaptics to develop analog chips capable of emulating neural networks using floating-gate transistors. At that time, neural networks were considered a bad idea by the artificial intelligence (AI) experts. Twenty-five years later, however, they became the only practical solution to the recognition of complex patterns, a very difficult problem.</p>
        
        <p>Up to the age of 40, I lived doing what most of us do: I sought happiness outside myself, convinced that to be happy I would have to fulfill everything the world prescribes to that end. I buried myself in work and deeply repressed any interference that might distract me from my objectives, thinking that the harder the goals, the more happiness they should bring me if I succeeded.</p>
        
        <p>I rushed to check all the boxes on my imaginary "happiness list," pushing down any inner turmoil. I didn't want to be distracted from my goals for any reason. I told myself that to be happy, I had to first get to the end of that list.</p>
        
        <p>I was hostage to a kind of hypnotic trance and I had embraced the competitive and consumerist vision that dominates our society. I had lost the connection with my emotions and my inner reality. I had fallen into the trap most of us fall into.</p>
        
        <p>Looking back, I'm sure that, if I hadn't reached the bottom of the list, I would have continued to struggle until my death, without ever realizing that I was confusing an imaginary happiness with a real one.</p>
        
        <p>It was only because I crossed the finish line and took a break from the race that I was able to look inside myself. What I found was a deep suffering that I pretended not to feel. My first reaction was: What's wrong with me? How is it possible not to be happy when I have achieved everything that should make me so?</p>
        
        <p>As Simone Weil says: "Suffering is a door that we can choose to go through and then we learn something, or we refuse to open, and then nothing is added, rather, it takes everything away from us."</p>
        
        <h3 id="search">The Search for Truth</h3>
        
        <p>While studying neuroscience I wondered if it was possible to build a conscious computer. If materialism were right—as I then thought—the answer had to be yes. Therefore I explored all possible ways I could think of to achieve such a goal, reflecting deeply on the attributes of awareness. It didn't take long to recognize the big obstacle: the complete lack of understanding of the nature of sensations, feelings, and emotions, what philosophers call qualia. No matter how hard I tried, I could not find any way to convert the electrical signals of the computer into qualia, because qualia belong to a different kind of reality with no apparent connection to symbols. It was like trying to transform the feeling of love one feels for a child into a computer program.</p>
        
        <p>I also sensed that the cause of my despair was deeply connected with the mystery of consciousness and that further motivated me to try to understand. My situation placed this enigma at the center of my midlife crisis and led me to an experience of unexpected, unsolicited, and spontaneous awakening, which made me realize that consciousness is fundamental and beyond matter.</p>
        
        <p>From that point on, I embarked on a new path of searching for truth, which led me to investigate all aspects of reality, even those that I previously had taken for granted and would have never thought of taking into consideration. I realized that just as I had uncritically accepted religious dogmas as a child, I also had accepted those of science, replacing the old dogmas with the new ones.</p>
        
        <p>My awakening experience has already been described in my autobiography, entitled Silicon: From the invention of the microprocessor to the new science of consciousness, first published in Italy in 2019 and in 2021 in USA [1]. For the convenience of the reader, I report the experience below with minimal changes.</p>
        
        <h3 id="awakening">The Awakening</h3>
        
        <p>In December 1990, while I was at Lake Tahoe, California with my family during the Christmas holidays, I woke up around midnight thirsty. I poured myself a glass of water from the refrigerator in the kitchen and, sipping it, I moved into the adjacent living room to contemplate the lake, now dark and mysterious.</p>
        
        <p>I went back to bed and while I was waiting for sleep to return, I suddenly felt a powerful rush of energy emerge from my chest like nothing I had ever experienced before and could not even imagine possible. This alive energy was love, yet a love so intense and so incredibly fulfilling that it surpassed any other notion I previously had about love. Even more surprising was the fact that the source of this love was me.</p>
        
        <p>I experienced it as a broad beam of shimmering white light, alive and beatific, gushing from my heart with incredible strength. Then suddenly that light exploded. It filled the room and expanded to embrace the entire universe with the same white brilliance. I knew then, without a shadow of a doubt, that this was the substance out of which everything that exists is made. This was what created the universe out of itself. Then, with immense surprise, I recognized that I was that light!</p>
        
        <p>The whole experience lasted perhaps a minute, and it changed me forever. My relationship with the world had always been as a separate observer perceiving the universe as outside myself and disconnected from me. What made this event astonishing was its impossible perspective because I was both the experiencer and the experience. I was simultaneously the observer of the world and the world. I was the world observing itself! And I was concurrently knowing that the world is made of a "substance" that feels like love and that I am that!</p>
        
        <p>In other words, the essence of reality was revealed to be a "substance" or nous that knows itself by self-reflection, and its self-knowing is experienced as an irrepressible and dynamic love full of joy and peace.</p>
        
        <p>This experience contained an unprecedented force of truth, because it felt true at all levels of my being. At the physical level, my body was alive and vibrant like I had never felt before. At the emotional level I perceived myself as an impossibly powerful source of love, and at the mental level I knew with certainty that everything is "made of" love. For the first time in my life I had experienced the existence of another dimension of reality, a dimension that previously could only be known intellectually by reading about it, but not by living it: the spiritual level in which a person is one with the world.</p>
        
        <p>It was a form of direct knowing, stronger than the "certainty" offered by logic; a knowledge from the inside rather than the outside, which simultaneously involved all aspects of my consciousness: the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels.</p>
        
        <p>I like to think that I have experienced my nature both as a particle and as a wave, to use an analogy with quantum physics that is impossible to comprehend with ordinary logic. The particle aspect was the ability to maintain my identity despite experiencing myself as the world (the wave aspect). But my identity was also part of the world, because I felt myself to be the world with "my" point of view. So now I think that my identity is like one of the infinite points of view with which One—the totality of what exists —observes and knows itself. In other words, each one of us is a point of view of One, a part of One indivisible from It that contains Its essence and, as such, is eternal.</p>
        
        <p>That experience made me understand that, as the famous Lebanese aphorist Kahlil Gibran said: "Spiritual awakening is the most essential thing in human life, it is the only purpose of existence." That experience has completely changed my life and has retained its original intensity and clarity over the years. Even today it continues to have a powerful impact on my life.</p>
        
        <h3 id="questions">Key Questions</h3>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Live the questions now. Maybe in the future, gradually, without noticing, one day away, you will live the answers.</p>
            <p class="quote-author">—Rainer Maria Rilke, 'Be Patient'</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The encounter with my spiritual nature began a path of personal investigation into the nature of my consciousnes, the only one I can experience and know. Driven by the desire to understand and reconcile the ineffable unitive experience of awakening with everyday reality, I worked intensely on myself for the following 20 years, during which I continued to carry out my professional activity, first as CEO and then as Chairman of Synaptics.</p>
        
        <p>During that time I thoroughly explored my hitherto neglected inner reality, and tried to integrate it with the outer reality, living in and out of the world at the same time, so to speak: "in the world but not of the world." I also understood that the experience of the outer world is based on the reproducibility of shared events, while that of the inner world is strictly private and can be known by others only to the extent that we communicate it.</p>
        
        <p>This inner work was the source of many intuitions and spontaneous transformations of thoughts and attitudes which gradually led me to an integration and harmonization of the two worlds, changing me profoundly. The most evident aspect has been the almost complete disappearance of a type of restlessness and mental anxiety that had always been part of my inner landscape.</p>
        
        <p>I then began to question the theory that describes us as biological machines similar to computers because, based on the known laws of physics, we should be completely unconscious, just like our computers are. In fact, the taste of wine, the scent of a rose, the color orange, and the love for a son should not exist, because no scientist can explain how electrical or biochemical signals can produce these qualia. The fact that each of us feels them, and "knows" because of them, is indisputable, and this falsifies the idea that current physical theories are complete, i.e., they describe all of reality.</p>
        
        <p>We are repeatedly told that we are biological robots, while the intense personal investigation that occurred after my awakening revealed otherwise, through many other extraordinary and spontaneous experiences of consciousness.</p>
        
        <p>I felt that, rather than a body, we are spiritual beings temporarily imprisoned in a physical structure similar to a highly sophisticated drone. But if we allow ourselves to be convinced by those who insist we are only our mortal body, we will end up thinking that everything that exists originates only in the physical world. In that case we will not even ask ourselves questions about the nature and purpose of our creative impulses and emotions. In so doing we will also avoid investigating the meaning of our life which, as I now understand, is the most important part of our human existence and experience.</p>
        
        <p>In summary, if we believe that the inanimate matter can explain all of reality, we will support an assumption already falsified by the fact that we are conscious.</p>
        
        <p>As I progressed in my study, I gradually realized that, if we hypothesized that consciousness and free will are irreducible properties of nature, the scientific vision and narrative of reality would radically change and legitimize a profound spirituality, with unexpected consequences for both science and spirituality. But how could such a drastic change occur?</p>
        
        <p>In my opinion, science should try to answer all our fundamental questions, not eliminate from reality what it cannot explain. I therefore decided to devote myself full-time to the scientific study of consciousness, and, in 2011, I created with my wife the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation to support basic research on consciousness starting from the premise that it is a fundamental and irreducible aspect of reality. The stakes are too high not to seriously consider the hypothesis that consciousness may exist before matter, or perhaps simultaneously with it.</p>
        
        <h3 id="science">The New Science of Consciousness</h3>
        
        <p>If we start from consciousness, free will, and creativity as irreducible properties of nature, the whole scientific conception of reality is overturned. In this new vision, the emotional and intuitive parts of life—ignored by materialism—return to play a central role. Aristotle said: "To educate the mind without educating the heart means not educating at all." We cannot let physicalism and reductionism define human nature and leave consciousness out from the description of the universe.</p>
        
        <p>The physicalist and reductionist premises are perfect for describing the mechanical and symbolic-informational aspects of reality, but they are inadequate to explain its semantic aspects. If we insist that these assumptions describe all of reality, we eliminate a priori what distinguishes us from our machines and we erase our consciousness, our freedom and, above all, our humanity from the face of the universe.</p>
        
        <p>If, on the other hand, we take our inner world seriously and begin to investigate it with love and determination, we will discover a new Weltanschauung that promises a creative and cooperative future for humankind, full of profound satisfactions. Life cannot be defined only by mere biological aspects, but, above all, by the triumph of the spiritual nature of the universe which silently guides us.</p>
        
        <p>Quantum physics is already telling us that the universe is holistic and creative, and the new developments in quantum information theory justify, as we will see later, a new and revolutionary theory of consciousness and free will.</p>
        
        <p>From my perspective, the only possible way to explain how the universe can create life and consciousness is that the universe is itself alive and conscious from the outset. If you take this hypothesis seriously, the entire conception of reality is transformed, with enormous consequences that point to a brilliant and fulfilling future. Creativity, ethics, free will, and joyful love can only come from consciouness. The immense mechanical intelligence, beyond the reach of the human brain, that comes from the machines we have invented will then add tremendous strength to our wisdom. Otherwise our technology will be used against humankind by those who promote the materialistic vision of the survival of the self-proclaimed fittest.</p>

        <h3>What Is the World Like?</h3>
        
        <p>Today we are still grappling with this question, which human beings have always asked themselves. For centuries it was believed that the world consisted of earth, water, air, and fire in various proportions.</p>
        
        <p>Only in the last hundred years, with the advent of quantum physics, have we made great strides in understanding the nature of reality. We have in fact discovered that matter, which seems solid and compact, is instead made of vibratory energy!</p>
        
        <h3>At the Dawn of Science</h3>
        
        <p>Classical physics, which in my mind includes Galileo, Newton, and Maxwell, has provided us with the first mathematically precise vision of the physical world. This led to a mechanistic vision based on the concept of material particles interacting through forces. Every particle could be precisely located in space and time, and its future position could be predicted with absolute certainty if all the forces acting on it were known. Even though Newton had already recognized the existence of a universal force, gravitation, the action of which must be propagated over vast distances, he did not find it necessary to formulate a theory about how the force propagated. For him, "action at a distance" was a legitimate theory.</p>
        
        <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, however, Maxwell showed that electromagnetic waves could propagate in a vacuum, and in so doing resolved the mystery of action at a distance. The presence of a field mediating the interaction made it possible to explain how a force could act between distant objects. In fact, Maxwell himself named the hypothetical substance responsible for the transmission of the field the "aether." Thus the action at a distance was replaced by a local action that propagated at a finite speed from one point in space to another. The nature of the electromagnetic field, however, remained the great unresolved puzzle, because the field interacted with material particles, but was not made of particles. Hence, the field could not be explained in terms of Newton's particles.</p>
        
        <h3>The Worldview of Classical Physics</h3>
        
        <p>The worldview of classical physics is characterized by the fact that the objects of the real world, those that our senses perceive, are represented by elementary particles. These material particles have a mass and exist in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, which forms with time an independent framework (or reference system) in which all matter moves. The position and velocity of a particle are always precisely definable, in principle. The trajectory of a particle is, in fact, the continuous succession of the positions it occupies in space as time flows. The particles interact with each other via a field that transmits the force. The total energy of the universe is conserved. Therefore the principle of causality reigns sovereign, in the sense that if two identical systems are prepared in identical states and are subject to the same forces, they will evolve in an identical manner. Every aspect of the world that cannot be measured is considered a philosophical question, the resolution of which belongs to metaphysics rather than to physics.</p>

        <h3>A New Way of Thinking</h3>
        
        <p>The classical scientific method is excellent, but it has one great limitation: the human mind is more powerful than the scientific method. Being based on deduction, the scientific method is incapable of creating fundamentally new ideas not predictable from what is already known. For radical new ideas to emerge, deduction or logic are not enough. What is needed is intuition, which is more powerful than deduction, and which is therefore capable of breaking through the existing logical framework to create a new framework.</p>
        
        <p>Intuition is based on the deepest kind of knowledge that cannot be expressed symbolically because it is "felt." It is a knowing that, even if often communicated with great difficulty, has the extraordinary power to create a conceptual revolution. Think of Einstein's intuition that leads him to understand that time is not absolute, but passes at a different rate for observers who move at high speed relative to each other. The conceptual framework of Newtonian physics could not lead to special relativity via deductive processes. A new framework was needed. It was a matter of asking a different kind of questions than those generated by a mechanical view of time. Specifically, it was necessary to ask the question: What happens if the speed of light is the same in all the reference systems, whatever their relative speed?</p>
        
        <h3>The End of Classical Physics</h3>
        
        <p>At the end of the 19th century, classical physics was thought to be complete. Physicists were confident that the fundamental laws of the universe had already been discovered, and that there was nothing much left to discover. In fact, in 1894, renowned American physicist Albert Michelson stated, "It seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established." There were a couple of small clouds in the bright blue sky of physics, which seemed only details to be fixed with some refinement of the theories. But those "small clouds" turned into gigantic storm clouds that completely radicalized the way we understand the universe.</p>
        
        <p>The first cloud had to do with the problem of the so-called black body radiation, which created a theoretical infinity that showed the weakness of the theory. The second concerned the famous Michelson-Morley experiment that failed to detect the presence of the aether, the hypothetical medium through which electromagnetic waves were thought to travel. These two small problems led to two radical revolutions. The first triggered quantum physics, and the second, special relativity, respectively. They showed that there was something fundamentally wrong with the 19th-century vision. Our world was not a world of particles and fields in an absolute space and with an absolute time, as previously thought, but a completely different kind of world that began to reveal its secrets.</p>
        
        <h3>The Revelation of a New World</h3>
        
        <p>The first theory that revolutionized our conception of the physical world was the special theory of relativity of Einstein (1905). The failure of the Michelson-Morley experiment to detect the aether led Einstein to renounce the concept itself, and to postulate that: (1) there is no absolute reference system in which the velocity of an object can be determined because no experiment can determine the motion of a reference system; (2) the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all reference systems, regardless of the relative motions of the source and the observer. These two postulates, from which Einstein derived the theory of special relativity, led to a completely new way to conceive the relationship between space and time. He created a four-dimensional spacetime in which space and time are no longer independent of each other as in Newtonian physics, though this conception is incompatible with our common sense.</p>
        
        <h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>
        
        <p>Almost simultaneously with the theory of relativity came the discovery of quantum effects that, unlike relativity, affected the very nature of material objects. The history of quantum physics began with Planck in 1900 when he derived a formula for black body radiation. According to his theory, energy can only be emitted or absorbed in small quantities (quanta), which were subsequently identified as photons. Then Einstein realized that not only is light emitted and absorbed in discrete packets of energy, but that its very nature is particulate. Then in 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a quantum theory of atomic structure, in which the electrons could only orbit the nucleus at fixed energy levels. In 1925-1926, Werner Heisenberg proposed a formulation of quantum mechanics based on Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, while Erwin Schrödinger developed a formulation based on the Schrödinger equation, which describes how the quantum state of a physical system varies over time.</p>
        
        <p>These mathematical formulations of quantum theory completely overturned our view of the physical world, which was previously based on the assumption that particles of matter, such as electrons, are like small balls possessing a precise position and velocity simultaneously. With the quantum revolution, the materiality of the particles became something much more abstract, since the particles were dematerialized by being transformed into waves of probability, while their position and velocity became tied by the "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle," a connection that does not allow us to determine both measures simultaneously, but only one of the two with arbitrary precision, at the expense of the precision of the other.</p>
        
        <h3>The End of Certainty</h3>
        
        <p>Before quantum mechanics, physicists believed nature was strictly deterministic at all levels. The great French physicist Pierre Simon de Laplace believed that if an intelligence knew the position and momentum of every particle in the universe at a given moment, as well as all the forces acting on them, and had a mind powerful enough to analyze these data, it could predict the entire future and past of the universe. Quantum mechanics forever destroyed this belief.</p>
        
        <p>According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the position and momentum of a particle, such as an electron, cannot be determined simultaneously with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one is measured, the less precisely the other can be known. Furthermore, the act of measurement itself disturbs the system being measured, altering its state in an unpredictable way.</p>
        
        <p>Thus, even if we knew the initial state of a system with the highest possible precision allowed by quantum mechanics, we could not predict its future state with total certainty. We could only calculate probabilities for various possible outcomes. This inherent uncertainty is not a limitation of our measuring instruments or our knowledge, but a fundamental property of nature itself. The universe, at its most basic level, is not deterministic but probabilistic.</p>
        
        <p>This profound shift in our understanding of reality has far-reaching implications for our conception of causality, free will, and the nature of consciousness. It suggests that the future is not predetermined but open, that there is room for genuine novelty and creativity in the universe.</p>

        <p>The uncertainty principle tells us that the more we know about the position of a particle, the less we can know about its momentum, and vice versa. This relationship is not due to the imperfection of our measuring instruments, but reflects a fundamental limitation on what can be known about physical reality. The particle itself does not possess a definite position and momentum simultaneously; rather, these properties only become definite upon measurement.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>Quantum theory provides us with a striking illustration of the fact that we can fully understand a connection though we can only speak of it in images and parables.</p>
            <p class="quote-author">—Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity</h3>
        
        <p>The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Dirac in the mid-1920s represents one of the greatest conceptual achievements in the history of human thought. It is a theory of atomic and subatomic particles (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, etc.) that completely overturned the classical view of reality.</p>
        
        <p>These pioneers were followed by a second wave of physicists who built on their foundations. Julian Schwinger, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson developed quantum electrodynamics (QED), the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field. The success of QED led to the development of other quantum field theories to explain the weak and strong nuclear forces. Eventually, the Standard Model of particle physics was formulated, unifying the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces into a single theoretical framework.</p>
        
        <p>In parallel with these developments, Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (1915), which explained gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory, too, represents a radical departure from the Newtonian conception of gravity as a force acting at a distance between massive bodies.</p>
        
        <p>Despite their individual successes, quantum field theory and general relativity remain incompatible with each other. Attempts to formulate a quantum theory of gravity have led to approaches like string theory and loop quantum gravity, but a complete and experimentally verified theory of quantum gravity remains one of the holy grails of theoretical physics.</p>
        
        <h3>Particles Are Waves of Probability</h3>
        
        <p>In quantum physics, particles are not the tiny, solid billiard balls of classical physics. Instead, they exhibit a wave-particle duality. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this phenomenon: when individual particles like electrons or photons are sent through a barrier with two slits, they create an interference pattern on a detector screen as if they were waves passing through both slits simultaneously. Yet when we observe which slit each particle passes through, the interference pattern disappears, and the particles behave like discrete objects.</p>
        
        <p>This behavior is mathematically described by the wave function, a mathematical object that represents the quantum state of a system. The wave function doesn't tell us where a particle is but gives us the probability of finding it in various locations when we measure its position. Before measurement, the particle exists in a superposition of all possible states, represented by the wave function spreading throughout space.</p>
        
        <p>The act of measurement "collapses" the wave function, causing the particle to manifest in one specific location with a probability determined by the square of the amplitude of the wave function at that point. This probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics means that we can never predict with certainty where a specific particle will be found, only the probability distribution of many measurements of identical particles.</p>
        
        <h3>We Don't Know What a Particle Is</h3>
        
        <p>Despite the remarkable success of quantum physics in predicting experimental results with unprecedented accuracy, there remains a profound mystery at its core: we still don't truly know what a particle is.</p>
        
        <p>In quantum field theory, particles are viewed as excitations or disturbances in underlying quantum fields that permeate all of space. A photon, for example, is an excitation of the electromagnetic field. An electron is an excitation of the electron field. These excitations have wave-like properties but can also behave as discrete, particle-like entities when they interact with measuring devices.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, quantum entanglement shows that particles that have interacted remain connected regardless of distance, with the measurement of one instantaneously affecting the state of the other. This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein called it, suggests that our conception of particles as localized objects in space may be fundamentally incorrect.</p>
        
        <p>Some interpretations of quantum mechanics, like the Copenhagen interpretation, sidestep questions about the intrinsic nature of particles, focusing instead on what we can measure and calculate. Others, like the Many-Worlds interpretation or Bohmian mechanics, offer different conceptions of what particles might "really" be. But none of these interpretations has achieved consensus among physicists, and the question of what a particle truly is remains open.</p>
        
        <h3>The Worldview of Quantum Physics</h3>
        
        <p>The worldview that emerges from quantum physics is radically different from that of classical physics. It suggests that:</p>
        
        <p>Reality is not deterministic but probabilistic. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of individual quantum events, only probability distributions.</p>
        
        <p>The observer cannot be separated from the observed. The act of measurement influences what is measured, and the properties of quantum systems do not exist independently of observation.</p>
        
        <p>Locality—the principle that objects are influenced directly only by their immediate surroundings—is violated by quantum entanglement, which shows that spatially separated particles can be instantaneously correlated.</p>
        
        <p>The boundary between subject and object becomes blurred, as the observer's choices about what to measure affect the reality that manifests.</p>
        
        <p>The traditional concept of matter as something solid and substantial gives way to a view of reality as patterns of information and probability, with particles being more like events or processes than enduring "things."</p>
        
        <h3>A Monistic Conception of the Universe</h3>
        
        <p>Quantum physics points toward a monistic conception of the universe—the view that reality is, at its most fundamental level, a unified whole rather than a collection of separate parts. This is evident in several aspects of quantum theory:</p>
        
        <p>Quantum entanglement reveals that particles that have interacted remain connected regardless of distance, suggesting an underlying unity that transcends spatial separation.</p>
        
        <p>The wave function describes the state of an entire system, not just individual particles. When particles interact, they form a new, composite wave function that cannot be reduced to separate wave functions for each particle.</p>
        
        <p>The vacuum of space, far from being empty nothingness, is a seething sea of virtual particles constantly popping in and out of existence, suggesting that even "empty" space is a dynamic, energy-filled reality.</p>
        
        <p>Quantum field theory depicts all particles as excitations of underlying fields that permeate all of spacetime, implying that the apparent diversity of matter arises from a more fundamental unity.</p>
        
        <p>This monistic view contrasts sharply with the mechanistic worldview of classical physics, which depicted the universe as a vast machine composed of separate parts interacting according to fixed laws. It aligns more closely with certain philosophical and spiritual traditions that have long maintained that the apparent multiplicity of the world is underlain by a fundamental oneness.</p>
        
        <h3>How Do We Know?</h3>
        
        <p>The puzzling nature of quantum reality raises profound questions about the nature of knowledge itself. How do we know anything about the quantum world, and what does it mean to "know" in this context?</p>
        
        <p>In classical physics, we could conceive of knowledge as a straightforward representation of an independently existing reality. The observer simply discovers what is already there. But quantum physics teaches us that the act of observation affects what is observed, calling into question this naive realism.</p>
        
        <p>What we "know" about quantum systems is what we can measure, and our measurements always involve an interaction that disturbs the system. This leads to an inherent limitation on what can be known simultaneously (as expressed in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) and suggests that our knowledge of quantum reality is always partial and perspectival.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, while extraordinarily successful at predicting experimental results, relies on abstract concepts like complex-valued wave functions that have no direct classical analog. This raises questions about whether our mathematical models truly capture the intrinsic nature of quantum reality or merely provide a computational tool for making predictions.</p>
        
        <p>Some physicists and philosophers have suggested that quantum physics points to the need for a more participatory conception of knowledge, in which the knower and the known are not rigidly separated but engaged in a co-creative relationship. This perspective challenges the traditional Western epistemological model and invites a reconsideration of what it means to know.</p>
        
        <h3>Semantic and Symbolic Knowledge</h3>
        
        <p>There are two fundamentally different forms of knowledge at play in our encounter with the quantum world—semantic and symbolic knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>Symbolic knowledge is expressed through mathematics, language, and other formal systems. It is public, shareable, and can be communicated precisely. The equations of quantum mechanics embody symbolic knowledge about the quantum world. This knowledge allows us to calculate probabilities, design experiments, and build technologies like lasers and transistors.</p>
        
        <p>Semantic knowledge, on the other hand, refers to the direct, experiential understanding or meaning that arises in consciousness. It is private, subjective, and cannot be fully captured in symbols. When a physicist develops an intuition for how quantum systems behave or experiences an "aha" moment of understanding, this involves semantic knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>The relationship between these two forms of knowledge is complex. Symbolic knowledge, like the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, can guide and structure our semantic understanding. Conversely, semantic insights—like Bohr's intuition about the quantization of atomic energy levels—can lead to new symbolic formulations.</p>
        
        <p>The interpretations of quantum mechanics can be seen as attempts to bridge the gap between symbolic and semantic knowledge—to create a coherent semantic understanding that aligns with the symbolic formalism. But the persistent debates and puzzles surrounding these interpretations suggest that a complete mapping between symbolic and semantic understanding of quantum reality remains elusive.</p>
        
        <h3>What Is Consciousness Good For?</h3>
        
        <p>The enigmas of quantum physics have led some thinkers to speculate about the role of consciousness in fundamental reality. While mainstream physics generally avoids invoking consciousness to explain quantum phenomena, the measurement problem—how a quantum superposition collapses into a definite state upon measurement—has prompted various proposals about the relationship between consciousness and quantum processes.</p>
        
        <p>Some interpretations, like the original Copenhagen interpretation as articulated by von Neumann, suggested that the conscious act of observation might play a role in the collapse of the wave function. Others, like the Many-Worlds interpretation or decoherence theory, attempt to explain quantum measurement without reference to consciousness.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond the specific question of measurement, quantum physics raises broader questions about consciousness. If, as quantum theory suggests, reality at its most fundamental level is not made of solid, material particles but of patterns of information and probability, this opens the possibility that consciousness and matter might be different aspects of a more fundamental reality rather than consciousness being merely an epiphenomenon of material processes.</p>
        
        <p>The capacity of consciousness to unify diverse experiences into a coherent whole, to perceive meaning and value, and to make free choices might be understood not as anomalous features in a mechanical universe but as manifestations of deeper aspects of reality that quantum physics is beginning to reveal. In this view, consciousness is not just an evolutionary adaptation for survival but a fundamental feature of the universe, essential for the universe to know itself.</p>

    <div id="glossary" class="chapter">
        <h2>Glossary</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Materialism.</strong> A philosophical concept stating that matter is the substance of which everything is made, including mental states. According to materialism, consciousness is an epiphenomenon of matter. Materialism is now more often called physicalism to indicate that everything that exists is physical, in recognition that in quantum physics matter has become increasingly abstract, and ontology has shifted from elementary particles to the quantum fields of which particles are states rather than separate objects. Materialism or physicalism is a monism in opposition to idealism. Idealism is also a monism because it affirms that physical reality is a mental construction, i.e., matter is a phenomenon produced by the mind.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Meaning.</strong> The essence of the knowing that is carried by qualia within a conscious experience. Meaning can also be carried by classical symbols in conventional knowing, as explained under Knowing in this glossary. Meaning is what symbolic information is supposed to convey. The information handled by computers has no meaning to them, though it has meaning for their creators. Machines are indeed proxies of their creators. The fact that we attribute meaning or intention to a robot is a grave human misunderstanding that must be rectified. Much of the meaning of the objects that surround us was intuitively learned as children and then refined through education and experience, both at home and at school. For example, a stone may represent itself, or it may have an implicit meaning linked to its usefulness (a defensive weapon, or building material), or derive from an explicit agreement, for example, "If you see a stone in front of my front door, it means that I'm in my office." The meaning of physical objects is very different from the endogenous meaning of thoughts and feelings. For example, the meaning of a new idea or the meaning of the love I feel for my child come entirely "from within"; they are not agreements, implicit or explicit.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monism.</strong> A philosophical concept claiming that at the foundation of reality there is a single fundamental principle or "substance." Monism is opposed to dualism or pluralism.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Morphism.</strong> Indicates the existence of a map between one structure and another of the same or of a different type. For example, in set theory, functions are morphisms. In category theory, objects don't necessarily have to be sets and their relationships don't have to be just maps. In mathematics there are various forms of morphism with different properties, for example homomorphism, isomorphism, automorphism, epimorphism, etc.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Observable.</strong> In physics, an observable is a quantity that can be measured. If the system is governed by classical physics, the state of the system can be known directly because it is described by a real-valued function. If the system is quantum, however, the state of the system is not directly knowable (no-cloning theorem). What is observable can be obtained by transforming the quantum state of the system with a mathematical operator associated with the observable. However, this transformation produces a probability distribution of measuring each of the possible values of the observable, not the state that will be observed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>One.</strong> The totality of what exists, both in potentiality and in actuality. One is irreducibly holistic, dynamic, and creative. One is the interiority that connects all Its creations "from within." One wants to know Itself and self-actualize. Consciousness units (CUs) emerge from One each time One knows Itself with a new perspective about Itself. CUs communicate with each other and combine, thus creating all realities, both inner and outer. What we call matter is the outer aspect of reality made up of the symbolic forms created by CUs and seities to represent the meaning they exchange with each other to know themselves ever more.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ontic.</strong> Refers to what is real, what really exists. In the context of QIP theory, a quantum system that is in a pure state is in an "ontic state," i.e., in a well-defined state that can be known as a conscious experience (qualia) by the system that is in that state. The impossibility of cloning (copying, reproducing) a quantum state ensures that this state is private, only knowable "from within" by its owner. Note that the ontology is in the private experience, not in the representation of the experience that is what we call a pure quantum state. A seity is represented by a quantum system that is in an ontic state that evolves by maintaining the purity of its state. A seity can transform live information (shareable symbols) into quantum information (experience, meaning), and vice versa, with free will.</p>
        
        <p><strong>OPT (Operational Probabilistic Theory).</strong> This is a theory of theories based on information, considered to be the ultimate abstract entity out of which physical theories emerge. It is due to G.M. D'Ariano and his collaborators [7]. OPT derives all the fundamental equations of classical and quantum physics, from Maxwell's to Dirac's, based on six purely informational postulates. Within OPT, quantum physics supervenes on quantum information, and classical physics supervenes on quantum physics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Panpsychism.</strong> The idea that the mind or some other mental aspect—consciousness, for example—has always been an integral part of reality. Panpsychism is one of the most ancient philosophical theories, already proposed by the Vedas, by Thales, Plato, Plotinus, Spinoza, Leibniz, Russell, and many others. The QIP theory claims that a quantum system in a pure state consciously experiences its state. With QIP, panpsychism becomes for the first time a falsifiable physical theory. According to QIP, consciousness and free will cannot exist in any classical system because they cannot derive from any deterministic system, no matter how complex those systems are.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Part-whole.</strong> A part that also contains the essence of the whole. Two examples are (1) a seity that contains the essence of One, and (2) each cell of a multicellular organism that contains the genome of the fertilized egg that created the entire organism.</p>
        
        <p><strong>QIP (Quantum Information-based Panpsychism) theory.</strong> A quantum panpsychist theory developed by G.M. D'Ariano and F. Faggin [10], defining consciousness, for the first time, as the ability of a quantum system that is in a pure quantum state to experience its own state in the form of qualia. The theory also establishes that a conscious system can transform quantum information into live information, and vice versa, using free will, thus allowing communication with the classical world to be mediated by living organisms that translate live information into classical information, and vice versa. Within QIP theory, the phenomenology of a conscious experience is highly similar to the phenomenology of quantum information since an experience is definite, private, and cannot be reproduced, just like a pure quantum state. Therefore, quantum information can properly represent a private state only known by the system that is in that state (ontic state). The state of knowledge of an external observer of a system in an ontic state is called an epistemic state because the observer can only know the probabilities of manifestation of the observables.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Qualia.</strong> This term refers to the sensations and feelings that emerge in the consciousness of an entity following the perception of information. The first theory that specifically identifies a plausible physical correlate to qualia is the QIP theory. According to QIP, qualia can only originate in a quantum system that is in a pure quantum state that evolves by maintaining the purity of its state. Special quantum systems called seities can also direct the evolution of their pure state using free will, and communicate with other seities using live information. This involves free-will transformations from quantum to live information, and vice versa, performed by the seities without the need to have a physical body. Within QIP, the long-term memory of a conscious experience requires live or classical information [10].</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum computer.</strong> A physical system that exploits quantum entanglement as a computational resource. This allows operations to be performed exponentially faster than what is possible with a classic computer, at least for some algorithms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum entanglement.</strong> A phenomenon that creates nonlocal correlations between the states of the fields that have interacted. This phenomenon does not exist in classical physics. When two quantum systems interact, they become entangled by creating a new system whose state is "more" than the sum of the states of the parts. This means that the interacting systems are no longer independent from each other even after they have separated. Therefore, the measurement of the observable of one of the systems simultaneously determines the value of the entangled observable of the other system, regardless of their physical distance. The correlations of entangled quantum systems may exceed the so-called Bell bound, which the correlations of classical systems never violate. The Bell theorem establishes the maximum percentage of correlations (the Bell bound) that are possible in a classical probabilistic system when we repeat the same measurement process on many systems prepared the same way. Entangled quantum systems may inexplicably exceed such a bound. The only way to explain this phenomenon is that the state that will be measured cannot exist prior to the measurement, but must be created simultaneously for both systems during the measurement process. How these nonlocal correlations can happen is still a mystery, because they would require superluminal communication between the two distant systems, thus violating the locality principle upon which special relativity is based. In spite of the presence of instantaneous correlations, the probabilistic nature of the measurement outcomes does not allow superluminal communication because whoever communicates must know the state he needs to encode his message before the measurement, but that is impossible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum information.</strong> The amount of information contained in the quantum state of a quantum system. Quantum information can be manipulated in quantum computers using special techniques that make the state of a quantum system evolve deterministically. Note that there is a fundamental difference between quantum and classical states: the former are private, i.e., non-reproducible, while the latter are public, i.e., shareable.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum mechanics.</strong> By quantum mechanics we mean the physics of systems described by the Schrödinger equation or by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics; two formalisms that turned out to be equivalent. Quantum mechanics is non-relativistic and has been superseded by quantum physics represented by Dirac's relativistic equation, which is the foundation of quantum field theory. In G.M. D'Ariano's OPT theory [7], quantum physics supervenes on quantum information and classical physics supervenes on quantum physics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum nonlocality.</strong> Refers to the violation of the locality principle in quantum physics. This phenomenon is entirely due to quantum entanglement (see Quantum entanglement).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quantum vacuum.</strong> The state of lowest energy of empty space (vacuum). However, this energy cannot be zero due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This causes fluctuations in the vacuum energy with measurable collective consequences, even though the individual fluctuations are not measurable. For instance, the Casimir effect is an attractive force between two plates very close to each other due to such fluctuations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Qubit.</strong> The qubit or quantum bit is the elementary unit of quantum information, i.e., it is the quantum version of the classical bit. While a classical bit only represents two possible states, the qubit represents the quantum superposition of two complementary state vectors in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, conventionally represented as |1⟩ and |0⟩, |up⟩ and |down⟩, or |right⟩ and |left⟩. This superposition creates an infinity of possible states that can be imagined as all the points on the surface of a sphere of radius 1 (called the Bloch sphere). Examples of qubits are the spin of an electron, whose two states are |up⟩ and |down⟩, and the polarization of a photon, whose two states are vertical and horizontal polarization, |^⟩ and |>⟩. Qubits can be entangled—a property not found in classical systems—allowing certain computations to be made much faster than is possible with classical computers. Over the past decade, the international race to develop a viable quantum computer has dramatically accelerated.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Randomness.</strong> Refers to a total lack of predictability of an event. A sequence of events that is not predictable by any algorithm is called random. The collapse of the wave function is a random event. When the same quantum experiment is repeated, even though each individual event is random, the frequency of certain patterns can be predictable. For example, when two "quantum dice" are thrown simultaneously, the probability of getting 7 as the sum of the two outcomes is three times that of getting 2. In this sense, randomness does not imply complete lack of any pattern. This is particularly relevant in quantum physics since individual events are random, but the repetition of random events may create highly reproducible patterns. In fact, the deterministic classical physics of macroscopic objects—which are made of huge numbers of quantum events—emerges from the randomness of quantum physics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Seity.</strong> Seity is a quantum entity with three irreducible and indivisible fundamental properties: consciousness, agency, and identity. The elementary seities, which I have called consciousness units (CUs), emanate directly from One. The combination of communicating CUs, each with its own consciousness, identity, and free will, gives rise to hierarchies of seities. By communicating with each other, the seities create layers of symbolic and semantic organizations that increase their self-knowing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Semantics.</strong> Deriving from the Greek sema, meaning "sign," semantics is that part of linguistics that studies the meaning of individual and combinations of words (signs).</p>
        
        <p><strong>State of a system.</strong> The state of a classical system is formed by the position and the momentum (velocity multiplied by the mass) of each classical particle that forms the system. This state requires six degrees of freedom for each particle and can be precisely known in principle. The state of system composed by N particles can then be represented by a vector in a real space of 6N dimensions. By analogy, the state of a quantum system can be described by a vector in a complex M-dimensional Hilbert space. The differences between a real and a complex M-dimensional space are, however, enormous, especially when the variables are probability amplitudes rather than ontological variables like actual positions and momenta. A quantum system can be described by a well-defined state, called a pure state, or by a mixture of states, called a mixed state.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Symbol.</strong> The term "symbol" indicates anything (sign, gesture, object, animal, person) that can represent a meaning other than that offered by its immediate sensible aspect. The meaning associated with a symbol can be either explicitly convened or intuitively understood (implicit meaning). To communicate, it is essential that the symbols be reliably recognizable. An object can represent more than one meaning if it can support two or more states that can be reliably discriminated. For example, a coin can represent two states (one bit of information), a die can represent six states (2.59 bits of information), two indistinguishable dice can represent 21 different states (4.39 bits), a computer memory of N bits can support 2<sup>N</sup> different states.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Thoughtform.</strong> Within QIP a thoughtform is a quantum system that exists in a pure state. Thus, it has a qualia experience for as long as it exists in a pure state. However, a thoughtform is not aware of being conscious, i.e., it is not self-conscious and therefore it has neither free-will agency nor identity. In other words, a thoughtform has no sense of self (identity), and cannot direct its actions with free will (agency). A thoughtform is like a cloud that "goes where the wind takes it," thickening, dispersing, and combining with other clouds, following the laws of the clouds without being able to direct its own behavior. A quantum computer is an example of a thoughtform, because it performs a series of deterministic unitary transformations that maintain the purity of its state during the execution of the program, but has neither agency (free will) nor self-consciousness (identity). A seity is a quantum field with identity, agency, and consciousness that can direct her own experience with free will. Once created, the seity exists and evolves as a part-whole of One for as long as One exists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Truth.</strong> I think that everything that One knows about Itself defines truth, since One cannot have internal contradictions. Given the holistic and dynamic nature of One already reflected in the fundamental nature of the physical universe we know, truth cannot be made of separable and static parts. Truth must be composed of parts-whole connected from within and evolving by ever deepening their own self-knowing without end. In my opinion this is why the mathematical theories we create to represent the physical world show unsuspected "connections" between them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Unitarity postulate.</strong> In the mathematical theory of quantum physics developed by John von Neumann in the mid-1930s, all state transformations in a quantum system are assumed to be unitary, i.e., they are represented by a unitary operator. Such transformations are reversible, maintain the purity of the quantum state, and are deterministic with respect to the probability amplitudes, which are the state variables in quantum theory. This means that the unitary evolution of a quantum system occurs entirely within Hilbert space. To produce a measurable event in spacetime it is necessary to have the "collapse of the wave function," a phenomenon that is not predictable by quantum theory. G.M. D'Ariano has recently proven that the unitarity postulate cannot be falsified, therefore it should be discarded, for it unnecessarily limits the types of quantum transformations possible and creates the "measurement problem" that no one has ever been able to solve.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Vedas.</strong> Religious and philosophical texts that originated in India more than 3500 years ago. Written in Vedic Sanskrit, they are the basis of Hinduism. There are four Vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda. The word veda means knowing, knowledge, or wisdom.</p>

        <p>The Italian version of this book with the title, <em>Irriducibile: La coscienza, la vita, i computer e la nostra natura</em>, was published by Mondadori in September 2022. I wrote Part I of that book in English and Part II in Italian for the reasons explained in the Preface. Following are the acknowledgments that appeared in the original Italian version.</p>
        
        <p>I thank my wife Elvia for translating the first English draft of <em>Irriducibile</em> in Italian, my son Eric, and Andrea Di Blas for reading the same draft and providing useful comments. Special thanks go to Viviana and Irene Sardei, my sisters-in-law, who served as editors of the Italian draft. Their patient work is highly appreciated because it definitely helped improve the clarity of my thinking and the fluency of the text. Viviana then contributed most of the rich quotes that show how my ideas, primarily born from my direct experience rather than from a comparative study of other people's thoughts, are also reflected in the ideas and experiences of many other thinkers and explorers of the inner world from ancient times to our days. There is no doubt in my mind that fundamental values unite all of humanity.</p>
        
        <p>I thank Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano, holder of the chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Pavia, Italy for the many discussions that have allowed me to better understand the physics of quantum information of which he is a world expert. His scientific rigor and the interest in the study of consciousness that now unites us have allowed me to remain with my feet on the ground, so to speak, in the exploration of such a challenging subject.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, I thank Enrica Bortolazzi, my book agent, and Guido Meardi, CEO of V-Nova, for their appreciated comments. Many thanks go also to Matteo Stroppa, editor of Mondadori, for his final touch.</p>
        
        <p>I translated the printed version of <em>Irriducibile</em> into English during the second half of 2022, and I decided to integrate in the main text most of the material of the Notes that were previously collected at the end of the book. I also improved the text with further personal reflections and some of the feedback received from the readers of <em>Irriducibile</em>. The English version was reviewed by Elvia Faggin, Edward F. Kelly, Tristan Ze, Andrea Di Blas, Michele Crudele, Franco Ferrant, and Carollyn Sloan Oglesby who are hereby warmly acknowledged. Many thanks go to Mollie Barker for her expert final copyediting.</p>

        <h3>The Evolution of Machines</h3>
        
        <p>Machines have evolved dramatically throughout human history, from simple mechanical devices like levers and pulleys to today's sophisticated computers and robots. This evolution reflects humanity's growing understanding of the physical world and our increasing ability to manipulate it for our purposes.</p>
        
        <p>The earliest machines were direct extensions of human or animal muscle power—simple tools like the wheel, the pulley, and the lever that amplified physical strength. The next major advancement came with the harnessing of non-muscular energy sources: water wheels, windmills, and then the steam engine, which enabled the Industrial Revolution.</p>
        
        <p>The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the development of increasingly complex mechanical systems: internal combustion engines, automobiles, airplanes. These machines were characterized by their specialized functions and purely mechanical operation—they transformed energy from one form to another according to fixed designs.</p>
        
        <p>A revolutionary leap occurred with the development of electronic computers in the mid-20th century. Unlike previous machines that were designed to perform specific physical tasks, computers were general-purpose information processors that could be programmed to carry out diverse functions. This marked a transition from machines as physical tools to machines as symbolic processors.</p>
        
        <h3>Before the Information Revolution</h3>
        
        <p>Before the advent of digital computers, machines performed specific functions through their physical structure and mechanical operation. A clock, for example, measured time through the regular movement of gears and springs; a loom wove cloth by the mechanical manipulation of threads.</p>
        
        <p>These earlier machines were characterized by several limitations:
        <br>- They were specialized: each machine performed a specific task determined by its physical design.
        <br>- They operated according to fixed procedures: their behavior was determined entirely by their mechanical structure.
        <br>- They had limited adaptability: they could not learn or change their behavior based on experience.
        <br>- They processed energy rather than information: they transformed physical forces rather than manipulating symbols.
        </p>
        
        <p>The mechanical calculators developed in the 17th-19th centuries, like Pascal's calculator and Babbage's difference engine, represented important steps toward information-processing machines. But these were still fundamentally mechanical devices, limited by the physical constraints of their design.</p>
        
        <p>The transition to electronic computing represented a radical shift. Instead of encoding procedures in mechanical linkages, electronic computers encoded them in patterns of electrical signals that could be rapidly changed and reconfigured. This enabled a level of flexibility, speed, and complexity that was impossible with purely mechanical systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Computers Are Universal Machines</h3>
        
        <p>The development of electronic computers in the mid-20th century marked a revolution in the nature of machines. Unlike specialized mechanical devices that perform specific physical tasks, computers are universal machines—they can, in principle, simulate any other machine or process that can be precisely described.</p>
        
        <p>This universality is based on a profound theoretical insight: any well-defined process can be broken down into simple, algorithmic steps that can be executed by a sufficiently powerful computer. This is the essence of the Church-Turing thesis, formulated by mathematicians Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in the 1930s.</p>
        
        <p>Turing's concept of a "universal machine"—a machine that can simulate any other machine given a suitable program—forms the theoretical foundation of modern computing. Today's computers, from laptops to smartphones, are physical implementations of this concept.</p>
        
        <p>The universality of computers has profound implications. It means that a single physical device, properly programmed, can perform an endless variety of functions—word processing, mathematical calculations, image editing, game playing, simulating physical systems, and countless other tasks. This versatility has made computers central to nearly every aspect of modern life.</p>
        
        <h3>The Nature of Computers</h3>
        
        <p>To understand the capabilities and limitations of computers, we must examine their fundamental nature. At their core, computers are symbolic information processors that operate according to precisely defined rules.</p>
        
        <p>A digital computer consists of:
        <br>- Hardware: the physical components (processors, memory, input/output devices) that manipulate and store patterns of electrical signals.
        <br>- Software: the programs or instructions that define what operations the hardware should perform.
        </p>
        
        <p>The operation of a computer can be understood at multiple levels:
        <br>- At the physical level, it involves the movement of electrons through semiconductor materials and the storage of electrical charges in memory cells.
        <br>- At the logical level, it involves operations on binary digits (bits)—0s and 1s—according to the rules of Boolean algebra.
        <br>- At the algorithmic level, it involves the execution of step-by-step procedures to solve problems or perform tasks.
        <br>- At the application level, it involves the interaction between the computer and its users through interfaces and programs.
        </p>
        
        <p>Modern computers are astonishingly complex, with billions of transistors executing billions of operations per second. Yet despite this complexity, they still operate according to principles that are, at their foundation, deterministic and algorithmic.</p>
        
        <h3>Computers Are Reductionistic</h3>
        
        <p>A fundamental characteristic of computers is their reductionistic nature. They approach complex problems by breaking them down into simpler components that can be processed separately and then recombined.</p>
        
        <p>This reductionism is evident at multiple levels:
        <br>- In hardware, complex operations are reduced to sequences of simple logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
        <br>- In software, complex programs are structured as hierarchies of simpler functions or procedures.
        <br>- In data representation, complex entities (like images, sounds, or texts) are reduced to patterns of binary digits.
        </p>
        
        <p>Reductionism has been enormously successful in computing, enabling the development of highly complex systems through the composition of simpler, well-understood components. It also aligns with the reductionistic approach that has been dominant in much of modern science.</p>
        
        <p>However, reductionism has limitations. Some phenomena resist reduction to simpler components—they exhibit emergent properties that arise from the complex interactions of many parts and cannot be understood by analyzing the parts in isolation. Examples include consciousness, living systems, and certain aspects of quantum physics.</p>
        
        <p>These limitations of reductionism raise questions about the ability of computers to model or simulate certain aspects of reality, particularly those that are inherently holistic or emergent.</p>
        
        <h3>Computers Are Deterministic</h3>
        
        <p>Classical computers are fundamentally deterministic systems. Given the same initial state and the same inputs, they will always produce the same outputs when executing the same program. This determinism is a direct consequence of the deterministic nature of the physical processes that underlie computer operation.</p>
        
        <p>Determinism has important implications for computing:
        <br>- It enables reliability and predictability, which are essential for many applications.
        <br>- It allows for systematic debugging and testing of programs.
        <br>- It makes it possible to verify the correctness of algorithms and software.
        </p>
        
        <p>However, determinism also imposes limitations:
        <br>- It makes it difficult for computers to model inherently non-deterministic phenomena, such as quantum processes or creative human thinking.
        <br>- It means that computers cannot generate true randomness (though they can generate pseudo-random numbers that are practically unpredictable).
        <br>- It suggests that computers, as currently conceived, cannot exhibit genuine free will or autonomy.
        </p>
        
        <p>Some approaches to computing, such as quantum computing or neuromorphic computing, explore non-deterministic or probabilistic models. These alternative paradigms may enable computers to overcome some of the limitations of classical deterministic computation.</p>
        
        <h3>Computers Can Be Unpredictable</h3>
        
        <p>Despite their deterministic nature, computers can exhibit behavior that is, in practice, unpredictable. This apparent paradox stems from several factors:</p>
        
        <p>Complexity: Modern computer systems involve billions of components and execute billions of operations per second. This complexity makes it practically impossible to trace or predict every detail of their operation, even though each individual step is deterministic.</p>
        
        <p>Sensitivity to initial conditions: Some computational processes, like those involving chaotic systems or floating-point arithmetic, can be extremely sensitive to tiny variations in initial conditions or round-off errors. This sensitivity can lead to widely divergent outcomes from seemingly identical starting points.</p>
        
        <p>External inputs: Computers interact with the external world through sensors, networks, and user inputs. These external factors introduce an element of unpredictability into computer behavior, even though the computer's response to any specific input is deterministic.</p>
        
        <p>Machine learning: Modern AI systems, particularly those based on neural networks, learn patterns from data in ways that can be opaque even to their designers. The resulting models may make predictions or decisions that are difficult to explain or anticipate.</p>
        
        <p>These sources of unpredictability have practical implications, particularly as computers increasingly control critical systems like autonomous vehicles, financial markets, and medical devices. They raise important questions about verification, accountability, and trust in computing systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Robots versus Living Organisms</h3>
        
        <p>As robotic systems become increasingly sophisticated, it's natural to compare them with living organisms. Both can sense their environment, process information, and act accordingly. Yet there remain profound differences between robots and living beings.</p>
        
        <p>Structural differences:
        <br>- Robots are designed and built by humans, while living organisms have evolved through natural selection over billions of years.
        <br>- Robots are typically constructed from inorganic materials (metals, plastics, semiconductors), while living organisms are made of organic compounds organized into cells.
        <br>- Robots generally have a modular, replaceable structure, while living organisms have an integrated, self-maintaining organization.
        </p>
        
        <p>Functional differences:
        <br>- Robots run programs created by human programmers, while living organisms develop their behaviors through a complex interaction of genetic instructions, environmental influences, and (in many cases) learning.
        <br>- Robots typically have specialized functions, while living organisms engage in a wide range of activities (feeding, reproduction, defense, etc.) necessary for survival and propagation.
        <br>- Robots require external maintenance and energy sources, while living organisms are self-maintaining and can harvest energy from their environment.
        </p>
        
        <p>Experiential differences:
        <br>- Living organisms, at least many animals, appear to have subjective experiences—they feel pain, pleasure, hunger, fear, etc. There is no evidence that robots, even the most advanced ones, have any subjective experiences whatsoever.
        <br>- Living organisms have intrinsic motivations derived from their biological nature, while robots have only extrinsic purposes assigned by their human creators.
        </p>
        
        <p>These differences raise important philosophical and ethical questions as robotics advances. Can robots ever truly mimic the autonomy, adaptability, and experiential richness of living beings? What would it mean to create a machine that experiences the world subjectively? And how should we treat robots if they were to develop characteristics that we associate with living organisms?</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>Information is information, not matter or energy. No materialism which does not admit this can survive at the present day.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>A Brief History of Information</h3>
        
        <p>The concept of information has evolved dramatically over human history, from its origins in practical communication to its current status as a fundamental aspect of physical reality.</p>
        
        <p>In ancient times, information was primarily embodied in direct human communication and in physical records like clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, and manuscripts. The invention of writing around 3000 BCE represented a revolutionary development in human information technology, allowing knowledge to be stored outside of human memory and transmitted across space and time.</p>
        
        <p>The printing press, developed by Gutenberg in the 15th century, dramatically increased the scale and efficiency of information reproduction, facilitating the spread of knowledge throughout Europe and beyond. This technology helped fuel the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment by making information more widely accessible.</p>
        
        <p>The 19th century saw the development of electrical communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, which enabled information to be transmitted rapidly over long distances. These technologies began to separate information from its physical embodiment, transmitting it as electrical signals rather than physical objects.</p>
        
        <p>The 20th century brought a series of revolutionary developments in information technology. Claude Shannon's landmark 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" established information theory as a rigorous mathematical discipline. The development of electronic computers in the mid-20th century created machines specifically designed to process and manipulate information.</p>
        
        <p>In recent decades, the digital revolution has transformed information into the central resource of our economy and society. The development of the internet, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence has made information more abundant, accessible, and powerful than ever before.</p>
        
        <h3>What Is Information?</h3>
        
        <p>Despite its ubiquity in modern discourse, information remains a concept that is difficult to define precisely. Different disciplines approach information in different ways, each capturing important aspects of this multifaceted concept.</p>
        
        <p>In information theory, as formulated by Claude Shannon, information is defined in terms of probability and uncertainty. The more uncertain or unpredictable a message is, the more information it contains. This mathematically rigorous conception of information forms the basis for modern digital communication and computing.</p>
        
        <p>In computer science, information is typically viewed as data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a way that makes it useful or meaningful. This includes not only the raw bits and bytes stored in computer memory but also the higher-level structures and patterns that emerge from them.</p>
        
        <p>In biology, information is embodied in the genetic code, neural signals, and other biological processes that guide the development and behavior of living organisms. DNA, for example, contains information that specifies how to build and maintain an organism.</p>
        
        <p>In physics, information is increasingly viewed as a fundamental aspect of physical reality. Some physicists suggest that information, rather than matter or energy, may be the most basic constituent of the universe.</p>
        
        <p>These diverse perspectives on information share some common themes. Information involves patterns or structure, it reduces uncertainty, and it can be abstracted from its physical embodiment. Yet information also always requires some physical substrate or carrier—whether it's ink on paper, electromagnetic signals, or patterns of neural activity.</p>
        
        <h3>Shannon's Information</h3>
        
        <p>Claude Shannon's theory of information, developed in the mid-20th century, provided the first rigorous mathematical definition of information. This theory has been enormously influential, not only in telecommunications and computing but also in fields ranging from physics to biology to psychology.</p>
        
        <p>In Shannon's theory, information is defined in terms of entropy, a measure of uncertainty or unpredictability. The more uncertain or unpredictable a message is, the more information it contains when it is received. This counterintuitive definition reflects the insight that information is valuable precisely because it tells us something we didn't already know.</p>
        
        <p>Shannon's theory focuses on the statistical and syntactic aspects of information, deliberately setting aside questions of meaning or semantics. As Shannon himself noted: "The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning... These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem."</p>
        
        <p>This abstraction from meaning allowed Shannon to develop a precise, quantitative theory of information that could be applied to any communication system, regardless of the content being transmitted. It formed the foundation for digital communication, data compression, encryption, and many other technologies that define our information age.</p>
        
        <p>However, the very strength of Shannon's theory—its abstraction from meaning—also represents its limitation. Human information processing is deeply concerned with semantics, with the meaning and significance of information. Understanding how meaning arises from patterns of symbols remains one of the central challenges in information science.</p>
        
        <h3>What Is a Bit?</h3>
        
        <p>The bit (binary digit) is the fundamental unit of information in computing and information theory. It represents the smallest possible unit of information: a simple choice between two mutually exclusive possibilities, conventionally represented as 0 and 1.</p>
        
        <p>This binary representation is powerful because any information can, in principle, be encoded as a sequence of bits. Text, images, sounds, videos, and software—all can be represented as patterns of 0s and 1s. This universal encoding forms the foundation of digital technology.</p>
        
        <p>Physically, bits can be embodied in various ways. In a computer's memory, a bit might be represented by the presence or absence of an electrical charge in a capacitor, or by the direction of magnetization in a magnetic domain. In communication, bits might be represented by the presence or absence of an electrical pulse, or by different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
        
        <p>The abstract nature of the bit—its independence from any particular physical embodiment—is what makes digital technology so flexible and powerful. The same information can be stored in different physical media, transmitted through various channels, and processed by different devices, all without loss or distortion (in principle).</p>
        
        <p>Yet despite its simplicity, the concept of the bit has profound implications. The ability to reduce all information to patterns of binary choices suggests a deep connection between information and fundamental aspects of reality like logic, probability, and perhaps even the quantum nature of the physical world.</p>
        
        <h3>The Information of Conscious Entities</h3>
        
        <p>When we consider conscious entities like humans, the concept of information takes on new dimensions and complexities. For conscious beings, information is not just patterns of bits or signals but is intrinsically connected to meaning, understanding, and subjective experience.</p>
        
        <p>Human information processing involves several distinctive features:
        <br>- It is inherently meaningful: We don't just process signals but interpret them in ways that are significant and relevant to our goals, values, and experiences.
        <br>- It is contextual: The same information can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is presented and the prior knowledge and expectations of the person receiving it.
        <br>- It is multimodal: We integrate information from multiple sensory channels (vision, hearing, touch, etc.) into unified perceptual experiences.
        <br>- It is generative: We can create new information through imagination, reasoning, and creativity, not just passively receive it.
        <br>- It is embodied: Our information processing is shaped by our physical bodies and our interactions with the environment.
        </p>
        
        <p>These features distinguish conscious information processing from the kinds of information processing performed by computers and other non-conscious systems. While computers can manipulate symbols according to rules, they lack the subjective experience or understanding of what those symbols mean.</p>
        
        <p>This raises profound questions about the relationship between information and consciousness. Is consciousness a special kind of information processing? Or is there something about consciousness that goes beyond information processing altogether? These questions lie at the heart of ongoing debates in philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.</p>
